I then simplified it to the version I have now, and I still cannot get the loader to display.\r\n\r\nMy impression was that calling `StateHasChanged` in my `RunTest()` function would reload things but it looks like its only ever reloading one time, when the execution of the function is complete. My loading spinner never renders and my results component never gets hidden based on the if blocks around each of them. \r\n\r\nAm I approaching this the wrong way to get them to render in proper sequence/when they should based on my test running?\r\n\r\n```\r\n@inject AppState state\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <h3>Choose Test Params</h3>\r\n  <div class=\"container form-group\">\r\n    <label for=\"source\">Data Source:</label>\r\n    <select class=\"form-control\" id=\"source\" disabled bind=\"testParams.DataSource\">\r\n      <option value=\"1\">Source 1</option>\r\n    </select>\r\n\r\n    <label for=\"recCount\">Record Count:</label>\r\n    <select class=\"form-control\" id=\"recCount\" bind=\"testParams.RecordCount\">\r\n      <option value=\"1\">1</option>\r\n      <option value=\"50\">50</option>\r\n      <option value=\"500\">500</option>\r\n      <option value=\"1000\">1000</option>\r\n    </select>\r\n\r\n    <label for=\"ddlThreads\">Thread Count:</label>\r\n    <select class=\"form-control\" id=\"ddlThreads\" bind=\"testParams.ThreadCount\">\r\n      <option value=\"1\">1</option>\r\n      <option value=\"3\">3</option>\r\n      <option value=\"5\">5</option>\r\n    </select>\r\n\r\n    <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" type=\"button\" onclick=@(() => RunTest())>Run Test</button>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  @if(IsLoading)\r\n  {\r\n    <div class=\"loader\" />\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if(TestComplete)\r\n  {\r\n    <Results Res=state.Res></Results>\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @*<Graph></Graph>*@\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n@functions\r\n{\r\n  [Parameter] Action<TestParams> OnRun { get; set; }\r\n\r\n  private bool IsLoading { get; set; }\r\n  private bool TestComplete { get; set; }\r\n  private TestParams testParams = new TestParams(1, \"\", 1);\r\n\r\n  private void RunTest()\r\n  {\r\n    IsLoading = true;\r\n    TestComplete = false;\r\n    StateHasChanged();\r\n\r\n    OnRun(testParams);\r\n\r\n    IsLoading = false;\r\n    TestComplete = true;\r\n    StateHasChanged();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1496","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Successive calls to StateHasChanged don't seem to work as intended\" (#1496)"},{"Id":"365678924","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-02T09:39:09","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"1507","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add required fields to build nuspec","State":"closed","Body":"These required fields are missing from the .Build nuspec, and this is blocking package upload.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1507","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add required fields to build nuspec\" (#1507)"},{"Id":"365682412","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-01T23:54:10","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"1509","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add package descriptions","State":"closed","Body":"Currently almost all of the Blazor packages have \"Package description\" for the package description.

The model is stored in Azure Storage as a Blob.\r\n\r\nThe function I use in the class library takes as input the DTO representing the input to the model in this case `IrisData` as well as the pretrained model as a byte array. The function returns a `Task<string>` so at no point are there any types other than those provided by BCL (on the Blazor side). The code for it is below:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static async Task<string> MakeSerializedPrediction(byte[] serialModel,IrisData input)\r\n{\r\n    PredictionModel<IrisData,IrisPrediction> model = await LoadSerializeModel(new MemoryStream(serialModel));\r\n    IrisPrediction prediction = model.Predict(input);\r\n    return prediction.PredictedLabels;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, from Blazor I load the blob as a byte array using HttpClient. I am accounting for the default handler issue #1372 . Below is what my page in Blazor looks like. My byte array is stored in the `serializedModel` variable which gets initialized inside the `OnInit` method. Then, inside the `predict` method is where I pass `serializedModel` and the `userInput` variable of type `IrisData` which contains the input from the user to make a call to the `MakeSerialPrediction` method. However, I get an error. Attached is the web console output. The class library works when tested on a console application and based on the browser console output it appears to be an issue with wasm/mono.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n@page \"/predict\"\r\n@inject

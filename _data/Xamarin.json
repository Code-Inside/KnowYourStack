A reliable way to get `TestResults.xml` files off of\r\nthe Android target device, so that we can get unit test results.\r\nA reliable way that works on a variety of Android API levels and their\r\ncorresponding emulators.\r\n\r\n(What do we want?  ***GREEN BUILDS***.)\r\n\r\nThe problem with 24158d08 is twofold:\r\n\r\n 1. When building an app with a `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` less than\r\n    `v9.0` (`$(lastword $(API_LEVELS))`), there is a build warning:\r\n\r\n        warning XA0105: The $(TargetFrameworkVersion) for 'Foo' (v9.0) is greater than the $(TargetFrameworkVersion) for your project (v5.0).

When *running*/using `Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` on an API-10\r\n    device/pre-API-21 device, there is a *runtime* error.\r\n\r\n(1) is ignorable, -ish.\r\n\r\n(2) is not:\r\n\r\n\tFATAL EXCEPTION: main\r\n\tProcess: Xamarin.Android.Locale_Tests, PID: 12615\r\n\tandroid.runtime.JavaProxyThrowable: System.TypeLoadException: Could not resolve type with token 010000d4 from typeref (expected class 'Android.OS.BaseBundle' in assembly 'Mono.Android, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=84e04ff9cfb79065')\r\n\t  at Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.AndroidRunner.GetSetupTestTarget (Android.Content.Intent intent) [0x00000] in /Users/builder/data/lanes/6102/d2851781/source/monodroid/external/xamarin-android/src/Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite/Gui/AndroidRunner.cs:345\r\n\t  at Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.TestSuiteActivity.SetupTestTarget () [0x00008] in /Users/builder/data/lanes/6102/d2851781/source/monodroid/external/xamarin-android/src/Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite/Gui/Activities/TestSuiteActivity.cs:246\r\n\t  at Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.TestSuiteActivity.UpdateData (Android.Runtime.JavaList`1[T] data, Android.Widget.ListView lv) [0x00006] in /Users/builder/data/lanes/6102/d2851781/source/monodroid/external/xamarin-android/src/Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite/Gui/Activities/TestSuiteActivity.cs:137\r\n\t  at Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.TestSuiteActivity.OnCreate (Android.OS.Bundle bundle) [0x0003b] in /Users/builder/data/lanes/6102/d2851781/source/monodroid/external/xamarin-android/src/Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite/Gui/Activities/TestSuiteActivity.cs:49\r\n\t  at Xamarin.Android.LocaleTests.MainActivity.OnCreate (Android.OS.Bundle bundle) [0x0000d] in C:\\Users\\peter\\source\\monodroid\\external\\xamarin-android\\tests\\locales\\Xamarin.Android.Locale-Tests\\MainActivity.cs:19\r\n\r\nConsequently, while 24158d08 gave *us* a green Jenkins job, the\r\nresulting assembly is not usable when run on Android devices < API-21.\r\n\r\nThe fix?  Partially revert 24158d08 so that\r\n`Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` is once again built against\r\n`$(firstword $(API_LEVELS))`, i.e. API-10, and instead update\r\n`Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` so that instead of using\r\n`Environment.DirectoryDocuments` -- which only exists in API-19+ -- we\r\nuse `Environment.DirectoryDownloads` on pre-API-19 devices.\r\n\r\nLet's see if this works!"},{"Id":"8277938793","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-17T20:08:45","Actor":"pjcollins","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2189","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Update to Build Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll for API-28 introduces possible breakage for existing XA Unit Test Apps\" (#2189) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"The recent changes to `Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` in https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2182 could cause new issues for users consuming this assembly if the Target Framework Version of the application referencing this assembly is not high enough.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Using a recent d15-9 build, attempt to build and deploy an XA unit test application targeting v5.1 or some earlier version in Debug or Release.\r\n2. I ran into issues when using the d15-9 version of Xamarin.Android.Locale-Tests. Seeing as this project does not explicitly set a `TargetFrameworkVersion` or `AndroidUseLatestPlatformSdk`, it will by default compile against MonoAndroid 2.3.\r\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/d15-9/tests/locales/Xamarin.Android.Locale-Tests/Xamarin.Android.Locale-Tests.csproj\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you have a repro project, you may drag & drop the .zip/etc. onto the issue editor to attach it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI am assuming that this breakage is going to be considered acceptable as it has a simple workaround, however we may be able to improve the type of error that could be encountered when an assembly has a higher compile version than the project referencing it. I believe we had talked about wanting to to promote the following warning type to an error[0]. Is that still on the roadmap? This change would help prevent some of the more difficult to diagnose error cases like those described in the 'Actual Behavior' section below.\r\n\r\n[0] `warning XA0105: The $(TargetFrameworkVersion) for 'Foo' (v9.0) is greater than the $(TargetFrameworkVersion) for your project (v5.0). You need to increase the $(TargetFrameworkVersion) for your project.`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nNow that `Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` is compiled with MonoAndroid v9.0, any projects which reference it and target a lower version are susceptible to breakage.

Before that API level, the libraries would be always\r\nextraced and placed in the application data directory, thus occupying more space\r\nthan necessary. API 23 added a new manifest `<application>` element attribute,\r\n`android:extractNativeLibs`, which if set makes Android not extract the\r\nlibraries to the filesystem. API 23 added a way to load those libraries directly\r\nfrom the APK. In order to support that there are a few requirements which this\r\ncommit implements:\r\n\r\n  * DSO (`.so`) files must be stored uncompressed in the APK\r\n  * `<application android:extractNativeLibs=\"false\"/>` must be present\r\n  * DSOs in the APK must be aligned on the memory page boundary (the `-p` flag\r\n    passed to `zipalign` takes care of that\r\n\r\nThis commit also implements `libmonodroid` suport for loading our DSOs directly\r\nfrom the APK. This operation mode is enabled by the presence of the\r\n`__XA_DSO_IN_APK` environment variable. This variable is inserted into the\r\napplication's environment by way of placing it in the environment file (a file\r\npart of the XA project that is marked with the `AndroidEnvironment` build\r\naction). In that mode, the DSOs are *no longer* looked up in the application\r\ndata directory but only in the override directories (if the APK is built in\r\nDebug configuration) and in the APK itself.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in order to activate the above mode, one has to perform the following\r\nactions manually:\r\n\r\n  * Add the `android:extractNativeLibs=\"false\"` attribute to the `<application>`\r\n    element in the `Properties/AndroidManifest.xml` file\r\n\r\n  * Add the following property to the project file:\r\n```xml\r\n      <AndroidStoreUncompressedFileExtensions>.so</AndroidStoreUncompressedFileExtensions>\r\n```\r\n  * Add an android environment file to the project with a line which says\r\n```\r\n      __XA_DSO_IN_APK=1\r\n```\r\nAfter that the application should work in the embedded DSO mode without\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nA couple of tests are provided to test building and execution of embedded DSO\r\napplication on device, as well as to validate the built APK."},{"Id":"8276839803","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-17T16:42:07","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2188","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"AppCompat Resources not found In Xamarin Android\" (#2188) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"### Question\r\nI'm trying to access `AppCompat`  resources which usually found under **android.support.v7.appcompat.R**, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nandroid.support.v7.appcompat.R.anim.abc_fade_in\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in `Xamarin.Android`, all could find under this name space was the `BuildConfig` class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAndroid.Support.V7.AppCompat.BuildConfig.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me figure out how could I access those resources?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

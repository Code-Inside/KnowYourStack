On macOS it will return\r\n`Darwin`, on Linux `Linux` etc. MSBuild (the build system, not the command)\r\ndefines a standard property `$(OS)` which names the operating system kind -\r\n`Windows_NT` on Windows and `Unix` on *nix systems.\r\n\r\nOur project and target files (also a large set of them from e.g. Mono) use the\r\nproperty to check whether they are running on Unix or Windows and they rely on\r\nthe property's value to be set correctly to make the right decisions.\r\nMSBuild (the system) supports setting of properties from the command line but it\r\nalso takes their values from the process environment. However, it appears\r\nthere's a major difference between Mono's xbuild (which is used by default by\r\nXA) and msbuild in that xbuild \"protects\" the `OS` property by NOT using the\r\nOS environment property to set its value, while msbuild sets the property from\r\nthe environment variable. This results in the property to have the value of\r\n`Darwin` on macOS and `Linux` on Linux and it happens to work (more or less)\r\ncorrectly on macOS because we do check for `'$(OS)' == 'Darwin' or '$(OS)' == 'Unix')` \r\nin a few places while we do NOT check for `'$(OS)' == 'Linux')`\r\nanywhere. All this together breaks XA build on Linux in a few places.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes the msbuild build (`make MSBUILD=msbuild`) to work on Linux by\r\nrenaming the Make `$(OS)` variable to `$(CURRENT_OS)` and thus \"protecting\" the\r\nstandard value of the `$(OS)` property during the build."},{"Id":"7198932731","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-05T14:30:24","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1271","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[build] Use .csproj files, not .mdproj files\" (#1271) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"(The extension is a lie!)\r\n\r\nCommit 6fd330df lists the ideal build scenario:\r\n\r\n> Load Xamarin.Android.sln into your IDE and Build the project.\r\n\r\nWe're not there yet.\r\n\r\nWhat *prevents* that?

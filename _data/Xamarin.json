It is a bit more performant than Mono.Cecil\r\nbecause it is a different library with different opinions.\r\n\r\nSome notes about System.Reflection.Metadata:\r\n\r\n- SRM has a forward \"reader\" style API\r\n- SRM uses lots of structs, and you have to do an additional call to\r\nlookup strings generally.\r\n- SRM, as far as I have seen, doesn't have APIs to modify and write\r\nout new assemblies.\r\n- SRM only supports \"portable\" pdb files.\r\n- SRM is not well documented yet. To discover usage, I read source\r\n  code and/or unit tests.\r\n\r\nFrom my benchmark above, it seems that SRM is 10x faster on\r\nWindows/.NET framework and 5x faster on macOS/Mono.\r\n\r\nSo it makes sense for use to use SRM when reading assemblies (and we\r\ndon't need symbols), and continue with Mono.Cecil for the linker and\r\nother things that modify assemblies.\r\n\r\nThere are a few places we can take advantage of SRM, but the simplest\r\nwith a reasonable impact was `ResolveAssemblies`:\r\n\r\n    Before:\r\n    320 ms  ResolveAssemblies                          1 calls\r\n    After:\r\n    112 ms  ResolveAssemblies                          1 calls\r\n\r\nSo a ~200ms savings on this MSBuild task, which runs on *every* build.\r\nThis was the Xamarin.Forms test project in this repo: a build with no\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n\r\n- Added a `MetadataResolver` type, as a way to cache `PEReader`\r\n  instances. This is a comparable drop-in replacement for\r\n  `DirectoryAssemblyResolver`.\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.IsReferenceAssembly` now uses\r\n  `System.Reflection.Metadata` instead of `Mono.Cecil`. This is used\r\n  in a few other MSBuild tasks.\r\n- A `MetadataExtensions` provides an extension method to simplify\r\n  getting the full name of a custom attribute. We can add more here as\r\n  needed.\r\n\r\nThe resulting code *should* be the same, except we are using SRM over\r\nMono.Cecil.\r\n\r\n## Downstream ##\r\n\r\nWe will need to add the following assemblies to the installer:\r\n\r\n- `System.Reflection.Metadata.dll`\r\n- `System.Collections.Immutable.dll`"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Forms":{"Events":[{"Id":"8877857905","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-13T06:45:44","Actor":"tekmun","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/4975","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"UWP Windows 10.1809 RichTextBlock ContextFlyout failed\" (#4975) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"RichTextBlock ContextFlyout no longer shown\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Build and run attached test project on MacOS \"avcapturesessiontest\" on a computer that has a video source like a USB webcam or iSight cam.\r\n2. The ViewController class then\r\n2b. Asks permission to access camera and microphone for input.\r\n2c. Creates and AVCaptureSession object\r\n2d. Finds default video input and creates input device object\r\n2e. Adds input device to AVCaptureSession\r\n2f. Adds output for live preview to AVCaptureSession with sample buffer output delegate\r\n2g. Creates AV PreviewLayer from AVCaptureSession\r\n2h. Adds live preview layer as layer or sublayer of ViewController's NSView object.\r\n2g. AVCaptureSession.StartRunning is called.\r\n3. Nothing displays in preview layer, and no sample buffers are output even though current state of AVCaptureSession.Running is true.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nUpon application launch, live camera/video input should be displayed in View of ViewController.\r\nSample Buffer should be ouput to delegate with every frame of video input.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nNothing displays in preview layer, and no sample buffers are output even though current state of AVCaptureSession.Running is true.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.\r\nVisual Studio: Help > About Microsoft Visual Studio > Copy Info [button]\r\nVisual Studio for Mac: Visual Studio > About Visual Studio > Show Details > Copy Information [button]\r\n2.

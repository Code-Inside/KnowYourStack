It adds support\r\nfor the generation of code behind for layout files. This will\r\nmake it easier for users to write code since they will no longer\r\nneed to use `FindViewbyId` manually. The generated code will\r\nautomatically provide properties for the various UI elements\r\nin the layout file.\r\n\r\nFor example if you have a Button with an id of `@id/myButton` you\r\nwill see a property is available on your activity `myButton`. You\r\ncan then replace code like\r\n\r\n\tvar button = FindViewById<Button> (Resource.Id.myButton);\r\n\tbutton.Click += delegate {\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n\tmyButton.Click += delegate {\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nmuch nicer eh :).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of caviats.

So\r\n\r\n\tpublic class MainActivity : Activity {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n\tpublic partial class MainActivity : Activity {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nNext is you need to add two items to your root layout of your\r\naxml/xml files.\r\n\r\n\txmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\r\n\ttools:class=\"$(Namespace).$(ClassName)\"\r\n\r\nwhere `$(Namespace)` and `$(ClassName)` are replaced with the\r\napproprite values.

I must note that this is not intended to 100% remove manual code of P/Invokes but to be an additional tool to avoid it whenever possible.\r\n\r\n### Potential Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a new attribute called `ExternizerAttribute` with the following definition:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)]\r\npublic class ExternizerAttribute : Attribute {\r\n\r\n\tpublic string LibName { get; set; }\r\n\tpublic string EntryPoint { get; set; }\r\n\tpublic bool ExternMethodOnly { get; set; }\r\n\tpublic Visibility ExternVisibility { get; set; } = Visibility.Disabled;\r\n\tpublic string CustomExternMethodName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\tpublic ExternizerAttribute (string libName) => LibName = libName;\r\n\tpublic ExternizerAttribute (string libName, string entryPoint) : this (libName) => EntryPoint = entryPoint;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProperty definitions:\r\n* **LibName**: Native library to be opened, this will be mapped to `DllImport`'s `dllName` constructor parameter.\r\n* **EntryPoint**: Native's library entry point to be called, this will be mapped to `DllImport`'s `EntryPoint` field.\r\n* **ExternMethodOnly**: Instructs the generator to only create the extern signature and no wrapper method around it.\r\n* **ExternVisibility**: Provides a way to customize extern's signature visibility, the default value is `Visibility.Disabled` which means that default visibility `private` will be used unless `ExternMethodOnly` is set to `true` this will turn visibility into `public`.\r\n* **CustomExternMethodName**: Provides a way to customize extern method's name. By default extern method names will be suffixed with `Extern` unless `ExternMethodOnly` is set to `true` and `EntryPoint` is omitted.\r\n\r\nA simple scenario of `ExternizerAttribute` would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[Externizer (Constants.MetalPerformanceShadersLibrary, \"DoSomethingNative\")]\r\nNSSet DoSomething (MPSImage[] objs, [NullAllowed] MPSImage img, nint ratio);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the output would be a wrapper method of the extern member that does casting and null checks:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[DllImport (\"/System/Library/Frameworks/MetalPerformanceShaders.framework/MetalPerformanceShaders\", EntryPoint = \"DoSomethingNative\")]\r\nstatic extern IntPtr DoSomethingExtern (IntPtr objs, IntPtr img, nint ratio);\r\n\r\npublic NSSet DoSomething (MPSImage[] objs, MPSImage img, nint ratio)\r\n{\r\n\tif (objs == null)\r\n\t\tthrow new ArgumentNullException (\"objs\");\r\n\tvar nsa_objs = NSArray.FromNSObjects (objs);\r\n\t\r\n\tNSSet ret;\r\n\tret =  Runtime.GetNSObject<NSSet> (DoSomethingExtern (nsa_objs.Handle, img == null ? IntPtr.Zero : img.Handle, ratio));\r\n\tnsa_objs.Dispose ();\r\n\t\r\n\treturn ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `DllImport` cannot be reused because it cannot be applied to methods inside an interface definition like we do in our API definitions because the `extern` keyword is expected and some additional compiler checks. Also having our own attribute gives us the flexibility to add additional information needed to better drive the generator.\r\n\r\nThe following attributes would also be needed to be taken into account:\r\n\r\n* [MarshalAs (UnmanagedType)] in return and parameters.\r\n* [NullAllowed] for parameter checks.\r\n* [return: Release] to allow to call `release` in the returned object if needed.\r\n* [Advice]\r\n* [iOS, Mac] and friends to write availability information.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nAgain the scope of this attribute is not to get rid of manual code 100% but to help where possible for example it would enable the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* The default behaviour is meant for simple scenarios where null checks are needed before calling the unmanaged function.\r\n* Generate the P/Invoke signature and use `[Wrap]` to do your thing.\r\n* Expose the P/Invoke signature directly to the public API without manual code.\r\n* C Arrays or variadic functions support is not in the scope of this attribute.\r\n\r\nA small example where this attribute would be useful:\r\n\r\n```c\r\ntypedef NSArray<MPSImage*>  MPSImageBatch;\r\nNSUInteger MPSImageBatchIncrementReadCount( MPSImageBatch * __nonnull batch, NSInteger amount );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould only require:\r\n```csharp\r\n[Externizer (Constants.MetalPerformanceShadersLibrary, \"MPSImageBatchIncrementReadCount\")]\r\nnuint IncrementReadCount (MPSImage [] batch, nint amount);\r\n```\r\n\r\n💣💥🚀"},{"Id":"7227164343","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T17:56:28","Actor":"spouliot","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3451","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[generator] Add support for [DesignatedInitializer].

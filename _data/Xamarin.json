As such, the\r\n`_ClassParse` target Inputs were looking for files which will never\r\nexist, thus causing the `_ClassParse` target to always execute.\r\n\r\nFix this by making `@(_ApiParameterDescription)` entries conditional\r\non the file `%(_ApiParameterDescription.ParameterDescription)` refers\r\nto actually existing, and update `@(_ApiClassParseXml)` and\r\n`@(_ApiAdjustedXml)` as well."},{"Id":"7504160301","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-10T02:00:08","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1522","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks] Try to speed up ConvertResourcesCases\" (#1522) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"We currently call `ConvertResourcesCases` in three different places. [1], [2], [3]. For the most part they process the same files , over and over and over again. On a large project this is totally a waste of time. If the file has been processed once and not updated then we should not need to process it again.\r\n\r\nSo the only exception here is `GenerateJavaStubs`. The case here is this needs to be done AFTER we have compiled the app.. but we need to replace any instances of `Foo.MyClass` with `<md5hash>.MyClass` which is generated in the java code. So we do still need to process the resource files for the app after the main assembly has been built. \r\n\r\nThat said if we know `UpdateAndroidResgen` has run, then we DONT need to run this again in `_CreateBaseApk`.\r\n\r\nSo this is an attempt to see if we can only process the files which have changed between each of those calls. Alternatively rework the targets so that we only have one call at the right place in the build system (probably as part of the `UpdateAndroidResources`)\r\n\r\nIf this does not work then the next task will be to rework the `AndroidResource.UpdateXmlResources` to NOT use `XDocument` but try to use `XPathDocument` or `XmlReader/Writer` instead since it is a streaming version and should be allot quicker. \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/5d64fb4bbad606eb4a3478085db0ca98616f9966/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets#L1951\r\n[2] https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/5d64fb4bbad606eb4a3478085db0ca98616f9966/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets#L1436\r\n[3] https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/5d64fb4bbad606eb4a3478085db0ca98616f9966/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets#L2011"},{"Id":"7504090833","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-10T01:35:58","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1528","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[windows] fail the build if bundle download fails\" (#1528) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"One of my biggest nightmares when developing for `xamarin-android` on\r\nWindows, is noticing when I inadventently modified the hash for the\r\ndownloaded bundle, or check out a newer commit where the bundle is not\r\navailable yet. In cases where the bundle gets a 404, this is merely a\r\nwarning and the build continues on. This is a problem on Windows, since\r\nit completely depends on the bundle download.\r\n\r\nDepending on the state of your build tree, one of the following could\r\nhappen on Windows due to a failed bundle download:\r\n- an `<Exec />` task fails, due to it trying to run `make`\r\n- thousands of build errors on `Mono.Android.csproj` complaining about\r\nmissing `mscorlib` types\r\n\r\nExplicitly failing the build on Windows, makes it a lot more clear what\r\nis wrong. It also fails the build faster, freeing up development/build\r\nagent time.\r\n\r\nI used the `$(MSBuildLastTaskResult)` built-in property to check if the\r\n`<DownloadUri />` task failed, even though it has\r\n`ContinueOnError=True`.

Button 1 creates a new activity instance and finishes the current activity, button 2 does a minor collection, button 3 does a major collection. \r\n\r\nThis device, when running a Xamarin.Android application, does not properly collect and dispose memory as we would expect. Some of the objects are eventually collected, after 2 - 3 minutes, but the memory never returns close to where it started. I've attached a profiler showing this. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run the application on the specific device and start profiler \r\n2. Click on the \"Start Activity\" button 10 times \r\n3. See the increase in memory over time\r\n4. Stop and wait several minutes, see GC running but the same amount of memory\r\n5. Click the Major collect button a few times\r\n6. Waited several minutes before seeing 1/3 of the memory collected but nowhere close to what it was before \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n- Expected memory to be collected after several seconds and after forcing a minor/major collection. We reproduced with a Samsung Galaxy S8 device that showed objects being collected properly. \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n- Had to wait several minutes without any memory collection happening. When we forced a memory collection, it took several minutes before we saw a slight dip in the memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Enterprise 2017 for Mac\r\nVersion 7.4.1 (build 48)\r\nInstallation UUID: bfdae6a6-34f9-4e8d-bf1f-35ab562c0a97\r\nRuntime:\r\nMono 5.8.1.0 (2017-10/6bf3922f3fd) (64-bit)\r\nGTK+ 2.24.23 (Raleigh theme)\r\n\r\nPackage version: 508010000\r\n\r\nNuGet\r\nVersion: 4.3.1.4445\r\n\r\n.NET Core\r\nRuntime: /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet\r\nRuntime Versions:\r\n2.0.5\r\n2.0.0\r\n1.1.1\r\n1.0.4\r\nSDK: /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.4/Sdks\r\nSDK Versions:\r\n2.1.4\r\n2.0.0\r\n1.0.3\r\nMSBuild SDKs: /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/5.8.1/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin/Sdks\r\n\r\nXamarin.Profiler\r\nVersion: 1.6.1\r\nLocation: /Applications/Xamarin Profiler.app/Contents/MacOS/Xamarin Profiler\r\n\r\nApple Developer Tools\r\nXcode 9.3 (14154)\r\nBuild 9E145\r\n\r\nXamarin.Mac\r\nVersion: 4.2.1.28 (Visual Studio Enterprise)\r\n\r\nXamarin.iOS\r\nVersion: 11.8.1.28 (Visual Studio Enterprise)\r\nHash: 3979d081\r\nBranch: d15-6\r\nBuild date: 2018-03-09 16:22:34-0500\r\n\r\nXamarin.Android\r\nVersion: 8.2.0.16 (Visual Studio Enterprise)\r\nAndroid SDK: /Users/aaronennis/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx\r\nSupported Android versions:\r\n4.2 (API level 17)\r\n4.3 (API level 18)\r\n4.4 (API level 19)\r\n5.0 (API level 21)\r\n5.1 (API level 22)\r\n6.0 (API level 23)\r\n7.0 (API level 24)\r\n7.1 (API level 25)\r\n\r\nSDK Tools Version: 25.2.5\r\nSDK Platform Tools Version: 25.0.6\r\nSDK Build Tools Version: 25.0.3\r\n\r\nJava SDK: /usr\r\njava version \"1.8.0_121\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)\r\n\r\nAndroid Designer EPL code available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/AndroidDesigner.EPL\r\n\r\nXamarin Inspector\r\nVersion: 1.4.0\r\nHash: b3f92f9\r\nBranch: master\r\nBuild date: Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:00:34 GMT\r\nClient compatibility: 1\r\n\r\nBuild Information\r\nRelease ID: 704010048\r\nGit revision: 6a86203dd590c6cfdf814c8832d24d2ad1e2606f\r\nBuild date: 2018-03-20 11:16:55-04\r\nXamarin addins: 8d83cea9e4ae03cb0c14ba3fbaafdbb0cbd170e7\r\nBuild lane: monodevelop-lion-d15-6\r\n\r\nOperating System\r\nMac OS X 10.13.3\r\nDarwin 17.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.4.0\r\n    Sun Dec 17 09:19:54 PST 2017\r\n    root:xnu-4570.41.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n\r\nEnabled user installed addins\r\nInternet of Things (IoT) development (Preview) 7.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<!-- If the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible -->\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload or provide a link to a reproduction case -->\r\n[MemoryTest2 (Latest).zip](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/files/1891263/MemoryTest2.Latest.zip)\r\n\r\n[ZebraTC56CJ Profiler.zip](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/files/1891268/ZebraTC56CJ.Profiler.zip)\r\n"},{"Id":"7502030136","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-09T17:22:04","Actor":"samhouts","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/2409","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[UI Tests] Add missing preserve attributes\" (#2409) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"### Description of Change ###\r\n\r\nThese tests do not render properly when the linker is enabled on Android.

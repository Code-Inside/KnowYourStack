On macOS it will return\r\n`Darwin`, on Linux `Linux` etc. MSBuild (the build system, not the command)\r\ndefines a standard property `$(OS)` which names the operating system kind -\r\n`Windows_NT` on Windows and `Unix` on *nix systems.\r\n\r\nOur project and target files (also a large set of them from e.g. Mono) use the\r\nproperty to check whether they are running on Unix or Windows and they rely on\r\nthe property's value to be set correctly to make the right decisions.\r\nMSBuild (the system) supports setting of properties from the command line but it\r\nalso takes their values from the process environment.

This results in the property to have the value of\r\n`Darwin` on macOS and `Linux` on Linux and it happens to work (more or less)\r\ncorrectly on macOS because we do check for `'$(OS)' == 'Darwin' or '$(OS)' == 'Unix')` \r\nin a few places while we do NOT check for `'$(OS)' == 'Linux')`\r\nanywhere. All this together breaks XA build on Linux in a few places.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes the msbuild build (`make MSBUILD=msbuild`) to work on Linux by\r\nrenaming the Make `$(OS)` variable to `$(CURRENT_OS)` and thus \"protecting\" the\r\nstandard value of the `$(OS)` property during the build."},{"Id":"7191607002","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-02T21:43:37","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/1269","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Add GetAndroidDependencies Target\" (#1269) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"We need to add a `GetAndroidDependencies` target which will output an `@(AndroidDependency)` with `%(AndroidDependency.Version)` metadata.\r\n\r\nValid component names are:\r\n\r\n* platform\r\n* build-tool\r\n* platform-tool\r\n* tool\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7190182297","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-02T16:24:49","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1239","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks] missing EmbeddedResource.LogicalName for __AndroidLibraryProjects__\" (#1239) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Fixes #1235\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a bug in msbuild [1] where if you create\r\nan item inside a task and the task is skipped, the metadata\r\nis not created for the item.\r\n\r\nSo we get into a situation where our `__AndroidLibraryProjects__.zip`\r\ndoes not contain the correct LogicalName.

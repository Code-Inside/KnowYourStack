It only worked on non-Windows platforms.\r\n 2. It ignored many errors.\r\n\r\nCommit 91a39725 only worked on non-Windows platforms because it worked\r\nby generating a **bash**(1)-compatible shell script which\r\n*backgrounded* the target invocations.  Errors were ignored because\r\nthe generated script always exited with an error code of 0:\r\n\r\n\tmsbuild RunTests.targets /t:RunNUnitTests &\r\n\tmsbuild RunTests.targets /t:RunApkTests &\r\n\t# ...\r\n\texit 0\r\n\r\nSuch a script won't easily run on Windows, and the `msbuild` exit\r\ncodes were ignored because I couldn't think of a good and \"reasonable\"\r\nway to capture them.  (To be fair, Google/StackOverflow/etc. did show\r\nvarious ways to capture the exit codes for backgrounded pipelines.\r\nI considered them all to be largely *unreadable*.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I didn't think that this would necessarily be a problem:\r\nif a unit test failed, it should report the failure in one of the\r\nNUnit `.xml` files -- largely so that we wouldn't need to read the\r\nJenkins Console Output to see what the *actual* error was! -- and thus\r\nignoring the exit status shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nTurns Out...that's wrong.

Requires finding a suitable build log.

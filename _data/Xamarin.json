https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Submitting-Issues\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGiven an app that uses a `ControlTemplate` to provide functionality, if the `ControlTemplate` has a `ContentView` above its `ContentPresenter` (i.e. after it in the XAML), the `ContentView` masks user taps unless its `IsVisible` property is set to false.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change from previous versions of Xamarin.Forms, where it was sufficient to set the `ContentView`'s `Opacity` to `0.0` (transparent) and events would pass through to views underneath.\r\n\r\n### Steps to

`0.0`, while its `IsVisible` is set to `false`.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Xamarin Forms, both pages would work, i.e. `IsVisible` would have no effect on the pass-through of events to layers beneath the top `ContentView`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ContentView` has to have its `IsVisible` set to `false` in addition to `Opacity` set to `0.0` in

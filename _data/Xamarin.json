It used an MSBuild item group to define the list of\r\nwell-known assemblies.  Each item in the group was a name of a\r\nwell-known assembly, without any file extension.\r\n\r\n02c07ed6 also included an automated test that checked the build output\r\nfor each of the well-known assemblies that should be skipped when\r\nbuilding a test project.  But one of the variable names in the test code\r\nwas unintentionally switched around, so the test was actually skipping\r\nover that check for the expected assemblies.\r\n\r\nLater, [b255da27][1] adapted the assembly skipping mechanism slightly to\r\nuse custom metadata to define the list of well-known assemblies.  This\r\nwas a step toward toward using custom metadata as a more general\r\ntechnique for various other scenarios too.\r\n\r\nJust by chance, there was a tiny missing change in b255da27, which meant\r\nthat the assembly skipping behavior got unintentionally disabled.  The\r\ntrouble was that the original item group in 02c07ed6 had been using just\r\nthe name of the assembly with no file extension, while the new commit\r\nused the full path to the assembly, including the file extension, and\r\nthere were a couple lines in `ResolveLibraryProjectImports.Extract()`\r\nthat were still searching through the list of \"well-known\" assemblies\r\nusing just the name rather than the full path.\r\n\r\nSeparately, starting in version 28.0.0, the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4\r\nNuGet package started to include a `monoandroid90/` target framework\r\ndirectory.  The `__AndroidLibraryProjects__.zip` embedded resource in\r\nthe `monoandroid90/Xamarin.Android.Support.v4.dll` assembly does *not*\r\ninclude a `res/` directory, so when the `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` is\r\n`v9.0`, the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 assembly is no longer passed to\r\n`<ConvertResourcesCases/>` at all.  Accordingly, that assembly name can\r\nnow be removed from the list of expected skipped assemblies in the\r\n`SkipConvertResourcesCases` test.\r\n\r\nI ran the updated `SkipConvertResourcesCases` test locally, first\r\n*without* the change in `<ResolveLibraryProjectImports/>` to confirm\r\nthat it failed, and then also *with* the change to verify that it\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nI also checked that these changes successfully restored the performance\r\ngains from b255da27.\r\n\r\nResults with `$(AndroidUseAapt2)` enabled:\r\n\r\n\tBefore:\r\n\t3359 ms  ConvertResourcesCases                      2 calls\r\n\t2562 ms  ResolveLibraryProjectImports               1 calls\r\n\r\n\tAfter:\r\n\t  62 ms  ConvertResourcesCases                      2 calls\r\n\t2500 ms  ResolveLibraryProjectImports               1 calls\r\n\r\nResults with `$(AndroidUseAapt2)` disabled:\r\n\r\n\tBefore:\r\n\t3237 ms  ConvertResourcesCases                      1 calls\r\n\t3234 ms  ResolveLibraryProjectImports               1 calls\r\n\r\n\tAfter:\r\n\t  94 ms  ConvertResourcesCases                      1 calls\r\n\t2641 ms  ResolveLibraryProjectImports               1 calls\r\n\r\nThis was the Xamarin.Forms.Performance.Integration.Droid project in this\r\nrepo, using an initial clean build.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/02c07ed6d9e0a2559d9948750ea798ff56db28e4\r\n[1]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/5f27d0cac299cf771cf4e815c4901c7ce768ad7c"},{"Id":"9871685848","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-06-21T22:16:48","Actor":"ndastur","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/3272","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"R8 compiler fails if custom proguard config edited in VS 2019\" (#3272) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

It is weird, though...\r\n\r\n## What should we do? ##\r\n\r\nOne idea is to look for `Mono.Android.dll` references in each\r\nassembly *instead* of `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the assemblies in Xamarin.Forms, there is a complication to\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n* `Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll` (a NetStandard library) references\r\n  * `Xamarin.Forms.Platform.dll` (a MonoAndroid library?) references\r\n    * `Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Android.dll`\r\n\r\nBut `Xamarin.Forms.Platform.dll` does not reference\r\n`Mono.Android.dll`?\r\n\r\nSo then should we \"recursively\" look for any reference to\r\n`Mono.Android.dll` in a given dependency tree?\r\n\r\nI don't think so? This would include more assemblies than we want...\r\nIn the above example `Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll` would get counted as a\r\n\"MonoAndroid\" assembly.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion ##\r\n\r\nI think we should stick with `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`, and in the\r\nrare case it is missing look for a `Mono.Android.dll` reference for\r\nthe single assembly. This seems like it is going to cover all cases to\r\nme, and we still will get good performance.\r\n\r\nSo we will cover:\r\n\r\n* `Xamarin.Forms.Platform.dll` counted as a \"MonoAndroid\" assembly\r\n  since it has a `TargetFrameworkIdentifier` (but no reference).\r\n* `Refractored.Controls.CircleImageView.dll` counted as a\r\n  \"MonoAndroid\" assembly. It has no `TargetFrameworkIdentifier, but\r\n  has a reference to `Mono.Android.dll`.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n\r\n* `<FilterAssemblies/>` needs to also check for an assembly reference\r\n  to `Mono.Android` as a fallback.\r\n* `<ResolveAssemblies/>` now adds a `%(MonoAndroidReference)=True`\r\n  item metadata.\r\n* When creating the `@(_ResolvedUserMonoAndroidAssemblies)` item\r\n  group, we also check for `%(MonoAndroidReference)=True`.\r\n\r\nI added a few tests to verify these scenarios."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Forms":{"Events":[{"Id":"9438377787","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-04-13T23:05:28","Actor":"brminnick","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/5911","RelatedDescription":"Opened

issue \"[Bug] `IsClippedToBounds` doesn't update clip rectangle when maximizing WPF window\" (#5910) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"<!-- Bug report best practices: https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Submitting-Issues -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI use an `AbsoluteLayout` within a `StackLayout` within a `ContentPage`. The `AbsoluteLayout` has `IsClippedToBounds` set to true. Everything works nicely when resizing the window (i.e. the clip rectangle is updated correctly), but the clip rectangle isn't updated when the window is maximized. You'll find a demo at the 'Screenshots' section\r\n\r\nThe `AbsoluteLayout` is the control that has the red background. When not setting `IsClippedToBounds` at all the `AbsoluteLayout` control is updated as expected when maximizing the window.\r\n\r\nI took a quick look at the [code](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/master/Xamarin.Forms.Platform.WPF/Renderers/LayoutRenderer.cs#L139) that sets the clip rectangle. I wonder why you use [`Clip`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.uielement.clip?view=netframework-4.7.2) and not [`ClipToBounds`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.uielement.cliptobounds?view=netframework-4.7.2).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a `ContentPage` with a single `AbsoluteLayout` and set `IsClippedToBounds` to `true`. Also set some background color to see the size of the control.\r\n2. Start the app and maximize the window.\r\n3. You'll find that the size of the control stays the same, whereas when you remove `IsClippedToBounds` the control is not clipped and will fill the window completely.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe clip rectangle should update when the window is maximized. Also I'm curious whether WPF's `ClipToBounds` would work.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe clip rectangle is only updated when the window is resized, not when it is maximized.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue: 3.5.0.129452\r\n- Last known good version: -\r\n- IDE: VSCode\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: <!-- All that apply -->\r\n  - WPF:  net471\r\n- Nuget Packages: yes, there are some more\r\n- Affected Devices: Laptop with Windows 10 x64\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![3D51pWFjDs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/237707/56085321-4715b180-5e41-11e9-9f1b-6dc3332331e4.gif)\r\n<!-- If the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible -->\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\nI don't have one at hand.

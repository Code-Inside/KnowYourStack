This might be the more important scenario because it can potentially affect end-user Xamarin.Android app builds.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in behavior between Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8.3 and Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 Preview 2. Admittedly, it only affects a narrow scenario: when the old `$(AndroidUseLatestPlatformSdk)` property is set to `true` and `$(AndroidSdkDirectory)` is explicitly set to a nonexistent directory. This *could* affect some users who have been using a custom value for `$(AndroidSdkDirectory)` and who haven't updated their projects to remove `$(AndroidUseLatestPlatformSdk)`, but it does seem somewhat unlikely. On the other hand, maybe the simple fact that `$(AndroidUseLatestPlatformSdk)` is not currently *ignored* is enough reason to preserve the original behavior for a nonexistent `$(AndroidSdkDirectory)` for now.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new **Visual C# > Android > Android App (Xamarin) > Blank App**.\r\n\r\n2. Set **Project Properties > Application > Compile using Android version** to the latest Android SDK version you have installed.\r\n\r\n3. Also set **Project Properties > Android Manifest > Target Android version** to that same version.\r\n\r\n4.

Build\r\n3. Add a new `TextView` to `Resources\\layout\\activity_main.axml`, with\r\n   an id of `textView1`\r\n4.

But\r\nthis file is updated by the `_GenerateJavaDesignerForComponent`\r\nMSBuild target. Further research showed that this target was getting\r\nskipped at step no. 4 above, because it was found to be up to date\r\naccording to its inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nTo verify this was the case, I could delete\r\n`obj\\Debug\\Component.R.cs.flag` which would also resolve the runtime\r\nexception (instead of a full `Rebuild`).\r\n\r\nFirst, I created a new test:\r\n- `CustomViewAddResourceId` builds a project with\r\n  `<android.support.design.widget.BottomNavigationView />`\r\n- Adds a `textView1` layout, builds again\r\n- Verifies that `obj\\Debug\\android\\src\\android\\support\\compat\\R.java`\r\n  contains `textView1`\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, I did the following:\r\n- Added `$(_AndroidResgenFlagFile)` as an input to\r\n  `_GenerateJavaDesignerForComponent`, so it will run again when\r\n  `_UpdateAndroidResgen` runs\r\n- Removed\r\n  `AndroidComponentResgenFlagFile=\"$(_AndroidComponentResgenFlagFile)\"`\r\n  from the call to the `<Aapt />` MSBuild task, so it will re-run\r\n  `aapt` and generate `R.java`.\r\n\r\nHowever, things are still breaking when `$(AndroidUseAapt2)` is\r\nenabled. Removing `AndroidComponentResgenFlagFile` from the\r\n`<Aapt2Link />` MSBuild task did not solve the problem here...\r\nI'm not seeing exactly what generates `R.java` when\r\n`$(AndroidUseAapt2)` is enabled?

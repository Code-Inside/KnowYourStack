The test will report any missing assembly and print the xml element that should be added to the file.\nE.g: `<File AssemblyName=\"FSharp.Core\" Version=\"3.98.4.0\" PublicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" ProcessorArchitecture=\"MSIL\" />`\nThen it's only a matter of copy/pasting that (:\n\nNote: even though this is the msbuild tests for iOS land I'm also scanning the Xamarin.Mac files here for simplicity.\n\nWe also scan all assemblies in `/Facades`.\n\nDiscussed in slack but adding all the facades assemblies doesn't compromise the project in the IDE (e.g: we still can't add incorrect assemblies) and it's required for some NuGet conflict resolution.\nSee: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/commit/ac8fd9e60aba0fae174eb7175a54d42a3c6b61f1"},{"Id":"8932682212","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-22T22:47:18","Actor":"spouliot","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/5452","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SIGABRT when calling NSLayoutManager.BoundingRectForGlyphRange\" (#5452) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"<!-- 🚨 STOP 🚨 𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗣 🚨 𝑺𝑻𝑶𝑷 🚨 -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease fill in the *entire* template below.\r\nThe template is designed to avoid unnecessary delays to confirm and fix reported issues.

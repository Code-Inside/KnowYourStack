So for the sake of simplicity, I think it would be fine just to increment the revision number in xamarin-macios by 1 after each published Xamarin.iOS + Xamarin.Mac release from the `d15-6` branch.\r\n\r\nOr it's also fine not to worry about updating the revision number at all. In that case, feel free to close the pull request. Thanks!"},{"Id":"7351984363","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-08T19:03:28","Actor":"dalexsoto","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3703","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Backport xcode9.3][monotouch-test] Stop MidiThruConnectionTests.FindTest from randomly failing \" (#3703) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7351980201","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-08T19:02:36","Actor":"dalexsoto","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3702","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Backport 15-7][monotouch-test] Stop MidiThruConnectionTests.FindTest from randomly failing \" (#3702) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7351923896","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-08T18:51:22","Actor":"dalexsoto","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3700","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[monotouch-test] Enhance MidiThruConnectionTests.FindTest from #3696 comments\" (#3700) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3696#pullrequestreview-102346431"},{"Id":"7351731169","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-08T18:11:40","Actor":"brendanzagaeski","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/3701","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Bump mono to get fix for mono/mono#7472.\" (#3701) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/7472.\r\n\r\nCommit list for mono/mono:\r\n\r\n* mono/mono@145ca6391f8 [d15-6-2017-10] Only null check target for delegate if method is not static.

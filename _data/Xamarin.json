Because every other message is related to a obj folder output. But if this is the case, what can I do to fix the issue? I would like to use the newer version because I have the hope that a few bugs in Xamarin.Forms are resolved (like the Navigating Cancel ignore issue on the WebView).

Updated to latest Xamarin (using VS on Windows). Also updated to latest on the Mac, including newest operating system and xcode 10.2\r\n2. Built application on windows machine. Moved the ipa file to the Mac.\r\n3. Tried to move the swift libraries I was using to the SwiftSupport folder in the ipa file, as I usually do. However, it seems the library I'm using doesn't use the Xcode 10.2 libraries and the Application Loader was complaining, so I installed 10.1 alongside it.\r\n4. After using the 10.1 lib files in the SwiftSupport folder, the upload to TestFlight is approved, as expected.\r\n5. Launch the app from TestFlight, insta-crash. Crash log from the device is attached.\r\n\r\nDebug build runs fine on the device. Any help would be a Godsend, thanks guys. I've been trying to get this running for days and now I'm worried I might have to try to reinstall older versions of Xamarin in order to get this working again, which would be another full day no doubt.\r\n\r\nServes me right for updating before doing this release.\r\n[timaticlogs.txt](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/files/3049548/timaticlogs.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nLaunch\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nCrash\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.\r\nVisual Studio: Help > About Microsoft Visual Studio > Copy Info [button]\r\nVisual Studio for Mac: Visual Studio > About Visual Studio > Show Details > Copy Information [button]\r\n2.

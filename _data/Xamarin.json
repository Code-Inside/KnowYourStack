This  works correctly on Android.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a Xamarin Forms App (shared project including UWP and Android)\r\n2. On the main page, put a ListView that binds to a viewmodel that has an Observable Collection of Strings.  The ItemTemplate of the List View contains a Label that binds to the string and a button.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ListView x:Name=\"lstItems\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding Items}\" RowHeight=\"48\" HeightRequest=\"144\" Margin=\"0,0,24,24\" VerticalOptions=\"Start\"  HasUnevenRows=\"False\" >\r\n            \r\n            <ListView.ItemTemplate>\r\n                <DataTemplate>\r\n                    <ViewCell>\r\n                        <Grid Margin=\"8,8,24,8\">\r\n                            <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\r\n                                <ColumnDefinition Width=\"3*\"/>\r\n                                <ColumnDefinition Width=\"1*\"/>\r\n                            </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\r\n                            <Label Text=\"{Binding}\"/>\r\n                            <Button x:Name=\"btnNext\" Text=\"Next\"  Grid.Column=\"1\" Clicked=\"btnNext_Clicked\"/>\r\n                        </Grid>\r\n                    </ViewCell>\r\n                </DataTemplate>\r\n            </ListView.ItemTemplate>\r\n           </ListView>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.  In the btnNext_Clicked event in the code behind, use the ListView Scrollto method to scroll the next item to the top of the screen with animation set to true\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void btnNext_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            MainPageViewModel vm = this.BindingContext as MainPageViewModel;\r\n            Button myButton = sender as Button;\r\n            Item myItem = myButton.BindingContext as Item;\r\n            int Index;\r\n            Index = vm.Items.IndexOf(myItem);\r\n           \r\n            if (Index < vm.Items.Count - 1)\r\n            {\r\n                lstItems.ScrollTo(vm.Items[Index + 1], ScrollToPosition.Start, true);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n \r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe next item in the list will visibly move to the top of the screen\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe next item suddenly appears at the top of the screen\r\n### Basic Information\r\nI believe this happens on UWP because the Xamarin Form's ListView.ScrollTo method is implemented using the UWP native methodl ScrollIntoView (  List.ScrollIntoView(c, ScrollIntoViewAlignment.Leading); )\r\nand ScrollIntoView does not animate the scrolling. To get animation to happen, you would instead use the **ChangeView** method of the ScrollViewer part of the UWP ListView.  For Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nScrollViewer theScrollViewer = GetVisualChild<ScrollViewer>(lstItems);\r\n double yPos = IndexToScrollTo * ItemHeight; //only works when item height is constant\r\n double scrollOffset = yPos - theScrollViewer.VerticalOffset;\r\n \r\nawait Task.Delay(1);\r\n theScrollViewer.ChangeView(null, theScrollViewer.VerticalOffset + scrollOffset, null, false);\r\n\r\n```\r\nI tested the above technique using a custom renderer for the Listview on UWP and it worked (the item animated as expected).\r\n\r\nHere is the definition for the UWP ChangeView method: \r\n`public bool ChangeView(Nullable<Double> horizontalOffset, Nullable<Double> verticalOffset, Nullable<Single> zoomFactor, Boolean disableAnimation)\r\n`\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  2.5.0.280555\r\n- Last known good version:\r\n- IDE: Visual Studio 2017\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: <!-- All that apply -->\r\n  - UWP:  10.0.16299  Fall Creator's Update\r\n- Nuget Packages:\r\nXamarin Forms 2.5.0.280555\r\nNet Standard Library 2.0.1\r\n- Affected Devices:\r\nDesktop, Tablet\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<img width=\"376\" alt=\"scrollto app\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2615390/37128914-65084952-224a-11e8-97f4-edfe81073fc4.PNG\">\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\nI am uploading a sample mainPage and a viewmodel.

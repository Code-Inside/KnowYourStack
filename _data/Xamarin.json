Since releasing the update, I've started having reports trickle in from various users about the app crashing frequently. I never had 2 users reporting the exact same instance causing the crash, so it took quite a while to track down what was happening.\r\n\r\nI finally figured out the sequence in app to make it crash (and why the reports differed so much), and started trying to find the cause. Debugging the app from VSfM gave me a rather unhelpful System.NullReferenceException on: UIApplication.Main (args, null, \"AppDelegate\");\r\n\r\nAfter turning on \"Show external symbols\" for debugging I was finally able to get a more useful stack trace of:\r\n\r\nXamarin.Forms.Platform.iOS.LabelRenderer.UpdateText() in \r\nXamarin.Forms.Platform.iOS.LabelRenderer.OnElementPropertyChanged(Xamarin.Forms.Label sender, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs e) in \r\nXamarin.Forms.BindableObject.OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindableObject.cs:138\r\nXamarin.Forms.Element.OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\Element.cs:401\r\nXamarin.Forms.BindableObject.SetValueActual(Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty property, Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject.BindablePropertyContext context, string value, bool currentlyApplying, Xamarin.Forms.Internals.SetValueFlags attributes, bool silent) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindableObject.cs:594\r\nXamarin.Forms.BindableObject.SetValueCore(Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty property, string value, Xamarin.Forms.Internals.SetValueFlags attributes, Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject.SetValuePrivateFlags privateAttributes) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindableObject.cs:391\r\nXamarin.Forms.BindingExpression.ApplyCore(SquadBuilder.Pilot sourceObject, Xamarin.Forms.Label target, Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty property, bool fromTarget) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindingExpression.cs:174\r\nXamarin.Forms.BindingExpression.Apply(bool fromTarget) in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindingExpression.cs:56\r\nXamarin.Forms.BindingExpression.BindingExpressionPart.<PropertyChanged>b__47_0() in D:\\agent\\_work\\1\\s\\Xamarin.Forms.Core\\BindingExpression.cs:547\r\nFoundation.NSAsyncActionDispatcher.Apply() in /Users/builder/data/lanes/5665/db807ec9/source/xamarin-macios/src/Foundation/NSAction.cs:163\r\nUIKit.UIApplication.UIApplicationMain() in \r\nUIKit.UIApplication.Main(string[] args, System.IntPtr principal, System.IntPtr delegate) in /Users/builder/data/lanes/5665/db807ec9/source/xamarin-macios/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:79\r\nUIKit.UIApplication.Main(string[] args, string principalClassName, string delegateClassName) in /Users/builder/data/lanes/5665/db807ec9/source/xamarin-macios/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:63\r\nSquadBuilder.iOS.Application.Main(string[] args) in /Users/tim/Projects/AuroraSquadBuilder/iOS/Main.cs:16\r\nThe app itself is open sourced now, so I can share the code leading up to the crash, as well as the sequence of events to cause it. I created an imgur album (http://imgur.com/a/tUNCz) outlining the steps to get the app to crash, since it's a lot easier to explain with images showing what to do.\r\n\r\nOn the main squadron page where you can see the ListView of all the pilots in that squadron, it shows a string with all of the upgrades equipped on each pilot in the list view cell for that pilot. My best guess is it's something to do with that being updated from having no upgrades to adding the first one, but I really can't say for sure. It's also notable that if you take an existing squadron with multiple pilots (for instance, adding multiple pilots, then backing all the way out to the list of all squadrons, then going back into the same squadron and equipping upgrades on the first pilot in the list), it works fine. It's only crashing when you add multiple pilots, then go back to the first and try to add upgrades all while viewing the one squadron.\r\n\r\nWhen the upgrade from the upgrades list is selected, it sends a message to the MessagingCenter, which is subscribed to at line 67 of PilotViewModel.cs (http://github.com/timrisi/AuroraSquadBuilder/blob/v1.3.2/SquadBuilder/ViewModel/Squadron/PilotViewModel.cs#L64). It makes it htrough the whole lambda, unsubscribes, then crashes somewhere after that.\r\n\r\nCurrently on VSfM 7.3.3 (build 7), Mono 5.4.1.7, XI 11.6.1.4. It crashes like this on any version of XF from 2.4.0.280 onwards (I updated originally to the latest version of 2.5.0). If I revert back to 2.3.4.270 (and remove the UseSafeAreas calls) it works just fine. Updating to a newer version again, even if I load back up the last version of my app and simply update the XF version to 2.5.0.x with no other changes, it starts crashing the same way.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the source code for XF and built it locally, then ran my project tareting that instead of the nuget packages. App crashes at github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/master/Xamarin.Forms.Platform.iOS/Renderers/LabelRenderer.cs#L287\r\n\r\nControl.Text = (string)values[1];\r\n\r\nControl in this case is null. Anyone have any idea what's going on? (Just got it all built and ran, so haven't had the chance to dig beyond that, and it's late so I'm off to bed. Will try to dig more tomorrow).\r\n\r\nI thought it might be related to my use of Xlabs.Forms for some pieceS (mostly MVVM stuff) so I removed the nuget packages and replaced them with my own lightweight classes, but the issue still persists.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps are outlined in an imgur album to include screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/tUNCz. \r\n\r\nIf you perform the same steps in an existing list (skip creating a new list and simply select an existing one with multiple pilots from the first page, then select the first pilot in the list and try to change upgrades) it works fine with no crash.  It only crashes with a new list.\r\n\r\nIt also works fine if you add pilots one at a time and equip them with upgrades before adding the next pilot.  It only crashes when adding multiple pilots in a new list, then going back to modify upgrades on the first one.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nApp does not crash\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nApp crashes\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  Anything later than 2.3.4.270 (So 2.4.x and on.

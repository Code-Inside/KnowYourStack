It is a bit more performant than Mono.Cecil\r\nbecause it is a different library with different opinions.\r\n\r\nSome notes about System.Reflection.Metadata:\r\n\r\n- SRM has a forward \"reader\" style API\r\n- SRM uses lots of structs, and you have to do an additional call to\r\nlookup strings generally.\r\n- SRM, as far as I have seen, doesn't have APIs to modify and write\r\nout new assemblies.\r\n- SRM only supports \"portable\" pdb files.\r\n- SRM is not well documented yet. To discover usage, I read source\r\n  code and/or unit tests.\r\n\r\nFrom my benchmark above, it seems that SRM is 10x faster on\r\nWindows/.NET framework and 5x faster on macOS/Mono.\r\n\r\nSo it makes sense for use to use SRM when reading assemblies (and we\r\ndon't need symbols), and continue with Mono.Cecil for the linker and\r\nother things that modify assemblies.\r\n\r\nThere are a few places we can take advantage of SRM, but the simplest\r\nwith a reasonable impact was `ResolveAssemblies`:\r\n\r\n    Before:\r\n    320 ms  ResolveAssemblies                          1 calls\r\n    After:\r\n    112 ms  ResolveAssemblies                          1 calls\r\n\r\nSo a ~200ms savings on this MSBuild task, which runs on *every* build.\r\nThis was the Xamarin.Forms test project in this repo: a build with no\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n\r\n- Added a `MetadataResolver` type, as a way to cache `PEReader`\r\n  instances. This is a comparable drop-in replacement for\r\n  `DirectoryAssemblyResolver`.\r\n- `MonoAndroidHelper.IsReferenceAssembly` now uses\r\n  `System.Reflection.Metadata` instead of `Mono.Cecil`. This is used\r\n  in a few other MSBuild tasks.\r\n- A `MetadataExtensions` provides an extension method to simplify\r\n  getting the full name of a custom attribute. We can add more here as\r\n  needed.\r\n\r\nThe resulting code *should* be the same, except we are using SRM over\r\nMono.Cecil.\r\n\r\n## Downstream ##\r\n\r\nWe will need to add the following assemblies to the installer:\r\n\r\n- `System.Reflection.Metadata.dll`\r\n- `System.Collections.Immutable.dll`"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Forms":{"Events":[{"Id":"8875362171","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-12T02:45:52","Actor":"davidortinau","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/4971","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Shell] Cannot navigate to a relative URI\" (#4971) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"### Description\r\n\r\nI should be able to navigate to a page without knowing the entire URI by using a relative URI.

The test will report any missing assembly and print the xml element that should be added to the file.\nE.g: `<File AssemblyName=\"FSharp.Core\" Version=\"3.98.4.0\" PublicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" ProcessorArchitecture=\"MSIL\" />`\nThen it's only a matter of copy/pasting that (:\n\nNote: even though this is the msbuild tests for iOS land I'm also scanning the Xamarin.Mac files here for simplicity."},{"Id":"8873381116","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-11T17:57:23","Actor":"mandel-macaque","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/5384","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[XHarness] Reenable the System.ServiceModel tests from the bcl.\" (#5384) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"Failing tests are because:\r\n\r\n1.

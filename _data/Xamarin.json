Connect to NetworkChange.NetworkAddressChanged and NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged events to event handlers\r\n2. Disconnect iOS wifi or change to another accesspoint\r\n3. Events never fire to tell you the address changed or the availability changed\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Windows UWP and Android, the events fire whenever the wifi connection changes to indicate the wiifi disconnected so the ip changes to 0.0.0.0 and then it fires again when the wifi reconnects and notifies you that the network address has changed to a new ip. \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using the NetworkChange class in Xamarin Forms on iOS, the events fire once after they are connected to event handlers. Then they never fire again no matter what changes with the iOS wifi or network settings. \r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue: 3.5.0.169047\r\n- Last known good version:\r\n- IDE: VS 2017 15.9.1\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: iOS <!-- All that apply -->\r\n  - iOS: 12.1 <!-- The version of the iOS SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 11.1 -->\r\n  - Android: <!-- The version of the Android SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 7.1 --> \r\n  - UWP:  <!-- The version of the UWP SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 16299 --> \r\n- Android Support Library Version: <!-- if applicable -->\r\n- Nuget Packages:\r\n- Affected Devices: iPad and iPhone\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<!-- If the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible -->\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n\r\n// Subscribe to NetworkChange events\r\nNetworkChange.NetworkAddressChanged += new NetworkAddressChangedEventHandler(m_OnNetwork_AddressChanged);\r\nNetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged += m_OnNetwork_NetworkAvailabilityChanged;\r\n\r\nprivate void m_OnNetwork_AddressChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n\t// Only fires once on iOS regardless of network change activity\t\r\n}\t\t\t\r\n\r\nprivate void m_OnNetwork_NetworkAvailabilityChanged(object sender, NetworkAvailabilityEventArgs _Event)\r\n{\r\n\t// Only fires once on iOS regardless of network change activity\r\n}\r\n"},{"Id":"9337517924","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-29T01:32:31","Actor":"samhouts","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/5375","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Accessibility android - label gesture recognizer doesn't not work when TalkBack is on \" (#5375) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"<!-- Bug report best practices: https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Submitting-Issues -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n1.enable talkback on your android device \r\nWhen accessibility - talkback is on the images or labels gestures does not work \r\nto reproduce please follow this \r\n <Label Text=\"Search\"  AutomationProperties.IsInAccessibleTree=\"true\" \r\n   AutomationProperties.HelpText=\"Double  tap search\"\r\n      HorizontalTextAlignment=\"Center\"/>\r\n        <Label.GestureRecognizers>\r\n             <TapGestureRecognizer Tapped=\"get_my_info\" NumberOfTapsRequired=\"1\" />\r\n             </Label.GestureRecognizers>\r\n     \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nwhen you tapped it raises the command and do what is suppose to do. the reader ignores the command so it only reads it as a label with no functionality. this doesn't not happen on ios  \r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue: Xamarin forms 3.5\r\n- Last known good version:\r\n- IDE:\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: <!-- All that apply -->\r\n  - iOS:  <!-- The version of the iOS SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 11.1 -->\r\n  - Android: <!-- The version of the Android SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 7.1 -->  all versions \r\n  - UWP:  <!-- The version of the UWP SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 16299 --> \r\n- Android Support Library Version: <!-- if applicable -->\r\n- Nuget Packages:\r\n- Affected Devices: samasung galaxy s8 , s9 , s10 and many more \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<!-- If the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible -->\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload or provide a link to a reproduction case -->\r\n"},{"Id":"9337516312","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-29T01:32:04","Actor":"samhouts","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/5315","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feedback] Updated Xamarin.Forms Nuget, Built -> 2000+ build errors\" (#5315) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"### Description\r\n\r\n\n<p>Updated Xamarin.Forms Nuget, Built -&gt;

If the persistent app is installable on\r\n    // external storage only split APKs targeting device above Android P should be uncompressed (as\r\n    // uncompressed native libraries crashes with ASEC external storage and support for ASEC\r\n    // external storage is removed in Android P).

Create a new **Android App (Xamarin) > Single View App** project.\r\n2. Add a new XML file `Resources\\values\\ids.xml` that has an intentionally invalid element:\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n    <resources>\r\n      <item/>\r\n    </resources>\r\n    ```\r\n3. **Build > Build Solution**. If this build fails with no error due to <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2427>, then repeat the build again. If the build succeeds, then you can stop at this step. If the build instead fails correctly with the expected `APT0000` error, then complete the additional steps 4–7 to see the problem.\r\n4. Exclude `ids.xml` from the solution by highlighting the file in the Solution Explorer and then selecting **Project > Exclude From Project**.\r\n5. **Build > Build Solution**. (Note: This build might fail with no error on the first attempt due to <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2427>. If so, repeat the build again until it succeeds.)\r\n6. Re-include `ids.xml` into the project.\r\n7. **Build > Build Solution**. (Again, repeat the build if needed to work around <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2427>.)\r\n\r\nIf it's more convenient, you can also use command line builds to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n1. After creating the project and adding the `ids.xml` file, delete the `.vs` directory, the `obj` and `bin` directories, and the `Resources\\Resource.designer.cs` file. Then build the project on the command line:\r\n    \r\n    ```cmd\r\n    msbuild -restore .\\AndroidApp1.sln\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Edit the `.csproj` file in a text editor to remove the `<AndroidResource Include=\"Resources\\values\\ids.xml\" />` item.\r\n3. Build the solution again.\r\n4. Edit the `.csproj` file to add back the `ids.xml` item.\r\n5. Build the solution again.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe build should fail at both step 3 and step 7 with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1>C:\\Temp\\AndroidApp1\\AndroidApp1\\Resources\\values\\ids.xml(2): error APT0000: <item> must have a 'type' attribute.\r\n1>C:\\Temp\\AndroidApp1\\AndroidApp1\\Resources\\values\\ids.xml : error APT0000: file failed to compile.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRebuilding the solution with **Build > Rebuild Solution** after either step 3 or step 7 produces this correct result.\r\n\r\nSetting `$(AndroidUseAapt2)` to `false` also leads to the correct result.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe build succeeds.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I tried a quick experiment where I set `$(AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator)` to `false` and repeated the steps. That did *not* change this particular behavior.\r\n\r\n### Version information\r\n\r\nXamarin.Android SDK   9.4.0.34 (d16-2/7cce305)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Int Preview\r\nVersion 16.2.0 Preview 4.0 \\[29027.242.d16.2stg\\]\r\nVisualStudio.16.IntPreview/16.2.0-pre.4.0+29027.242.d16.2stg\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.8.03752\r\n\r\n### Log file\r\n\r\n[MSBuildBinlogs.zip](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/files/3371176/MSBuildBinlogs.zip)"},{"Id":"9971521757","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-09T00:53:54","Actor":"AlenToma","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/3335","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug] Problem enabling Use Fast Development\" (#3335) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"<!-- Bug report best practices: https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Submitting-Issues -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\ncant emulate my android project when enabling `Use Fast Development`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

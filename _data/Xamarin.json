So basically intellisense is not working when referencing the binding project, but it works if you reference the assembly directly. The project will build and work as expected.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs in Visual Studio 2017. Issues does not occur in Visual Studio for Mac. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

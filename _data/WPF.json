This month we continue to port the WPF code base to work on .NET Core and all of the latest bug fixes and code updates for Preview 7 are available via the [daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/blob/master/README.md#installers-and-binaries).  The latest released version is Preview 6 and available via [this download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nThe team has been getting better and better at operating in the open, we have improved our issue triage process with a goal of triaging new issues at least twice a week.   This will ensure that we identify issues that need to be solved for .NET Core 3.0 and also to assign all issues to a milestone. \r\n\r\nWe have been working hard at fixing issues for 3.0 and porting additional functionality from .NET Framework.

The list and the respective default values in .NET Core are documented in this [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples/pull/87/files#diff-367b1d34f8344ca7b58710a6b1d70a1a).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank again for your contributions and engagement.

Updates our packaging to create a `Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf.DncEng.Test` package that contains our test infrastructure that compiles against `Microsoft.NETCore.App` instead of `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App`. This should be a fairly temporary solution until we open source the infrastructure entirely. There will be an internal PR that consumes this, and then once that is done we can update this repo to consume it.\r\n2. Adds a few of the packaging tests that don't have any special test content files and fixes them from the packaging refactor.

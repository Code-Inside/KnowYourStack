Create multiple WPF UI threads\r\n    - In fact, two are enough, one is the main UI thread with the App class we usually write; a background UI thread, for example, to display the UI thread that starts the splash screen.\r\n    - If you use two threads, you need a lot of repetitive trials to reproduce; and by creating more threads you can greatly improve the probability of a single recurrence\r\n2. These UI threads all display WPF windows\r\n3. This issue will occur in both WPF on .NET Core 3 and WPF on .NET Framework 4.8.\r\n\r\nphenomenon:\r\n\r\n - An exception is thrown and the application crashes\r\n\r\n **Actual behavior:** <!-- callstack for crashes / exceptions -->\r\n\r\n ```\r\nException thrown: 'System.NullReferenceException' in WindowsBase.dll\r\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n\r\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart.CleanUpRequestedStreamsList()\r\n   at System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart.GetStream(FileMode mode, FileAccess access)\r\n   at System.Windows.Application.LoadComponent(Object component, Uri resourceLocator)\r\n   at Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI.SplashWindow.InitializeComponent() in C:\\Users\\lvyi\\Desktop\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\SplashWindow.xaml:line 1\r\n   at Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI.SplashWindow..ctor() in C:\\Users\\lvyi\\Desktop\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\SplashWindow.xaml.cs:line 24\r\n   at Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI.Program.<>c__DisplayClass1_0.<RunSplashWindow>b__0() in C:\\Users\\lvyi\\Desktop\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\Walterlv.Bugs.MultiThreadedUI\\Program.cs:line 33\r\n```\r\n\r\n![The exception caught in Visual Studio 2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959623/51883630-bd685300-23be-11e9-9c71-a0a8d8d929e3.png)\r\n\r\n **Expected behavior:**\r\nDon't crash.\r\n \r\n **Minimal repro:**\r\n\r\n1.

Create a WPF app with a main window.\n2. Click a button that does two things:\n2a. Immediately shows another window as a dialog (using ShowDialog())\n2b. After a short delay, shows a third window as a dialog whose owner is the second window (the first dialog)\n3. In the first dialog's Loaded handler, the dialog closes itself after a short delay.\n\nWhat should happen:\nBoth dialogs close and both dialogs' ShowDialog() methods return.\n\nWhat actually happens:\nBoth dialogs close but neither dialog's ShowDialog() method returns.\n\nIn the attached sample, a counter is used to keep track of how many dialogs are currently being shown, based on the number of ShowDialog() calls.  Clicking the button multiple times keeps increasing the number of dialogs open (ShowDialog() calls).  Commenting out the indicated line in MainWindow.xaml.cs works around the bug.\n\nMotivating example:\nIn my app the first thing the user does is create a &quot;workspace&quot;.  Creating a workspace involves a number of steps and we show a progress dialog while those steps are being performed.  That progress dialog is dialog #1 from the sample.  Meanwhile, the app also checks for updates in the background during startup.  If an update is found, a separate dialog is shown telling the user about the update.  That is dialog #2.  If the user happens to tell the app to create a workspace and, while creating the workspace, an update is found, this bug is hit.\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/51151/wpf-showdialog-never-returns-when-a-dialogs-owner.html\nVSTS ticketId: 428554_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n\nHenning Dampel on 5/24/2018, 02:15 AM (239 days ago): <p>ShowDialog() also never returns if the dialog's owner is a normal window that closes.</p>\n\n_These are the original issue solutions:_\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/277","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WPF ShowDialog() never returns when a dialog's owner is closed and that owner is another dialog\" (#277)"},{"Id":"400720746","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T13:22:18","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"276","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n\r\n- System.Windows.Extensions - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.CodeDom - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- Microsoft.Win32.Registry - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Reflection.TypeExtensions - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Security.AccessControl - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Security.Cryptography.Xml - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Security.Permissions - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Security.Principal.Windows - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Reflection.Emit - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n- System.Diagnostics.EventLog - 4.6.0-preview.19067.6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/276","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#276)"},{"Id":"400716847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T13:11:00","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"275","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19067.6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/275","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#275)"},{"Id":"400269294","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-17T17:16:22","Actor":"pavelovcharov","Number":"273","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reference markup extension is missed","State":"closed","Body":"The System.Windows.Markup.Reference class is missed in NetCore3, although the WPF implementation seems to work as expected\r\n```\r\n[ContentProperty(\"Name\")]\r\npublic class Reference : MarkupExtension {\r\n    public Reference() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Reference(string name) {\r\n        Name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [ConstructorArgument(\"name\")]\r\n    public string Name { get;

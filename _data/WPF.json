The first reason is that its owner gets removed from the tree after the right-button-up gesture but before the PopupControlService initiates the display logic. The logic notices that the owner is not being displayed, and therefore doesn't display the context menu. This is by design - you shouldn't display a context menu for an element that isn't itself visible.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the (shared) context menu is in a bad state, where it's marked IsOpen=true, but isn't actually being displayed. The display logic doesn't do anything, since it thinks the menu is already open. This is a bug, left over from the first case, which doesn't reset IsOpen to false when it aborts the display logic. The net effect is that once a context menu doesn't open because of reason 1, it will never open again, even in cases where it should.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to reset the context menu's state when aborting the display logic.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nContextMenus stop working\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAd-hoc around customer scenario.\r\nStandard regression testing.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow.

The first reason is that its owner gets removed from the tree after the right-button-up gesture but before the PopupControlService initiates the display logic. The logic notices that the owner is not being displayed, and therefore doesn't display the context menu. This is by design - you shouldn't display a context menu for an element that isn't itself visible.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the (shared) context menu is in a bad state, where it's marked IsOpen=true, but isn't actually being displayed. The display logic doesn't do anything, since it thinks the menu is already open. This is a bug, left over from the first case, which doesn't reset IsOpen to false when it aborts the display logic. The net effect is that once a context menu doesn't open because of reason 1, it will never open again, even in cases where it should.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to reset the context menu's state when aborting the display logic.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nContextMenus stop working\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAd-hoc around customer scenario.\r\nStandard regression testing.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow.

The logic that determines whether such an addition requires a re-measurement predicts the height of the new extended viewport; in the odd state this sets the height to (extent.Height - viewport.Y), a negative number that's not allowed.\r\n\r\nThe first condition cannot happen during Measure, or immediately after; Measure starts by initializing viewport.Y to a value <= extent.Height. But it can occur after collection changes, as these can change extent.Height. Collection changes can also affect the quantities in the second condition. The first kind of change puts the height-assignment at risk; the second kind of change can allow the logic to reach the height-assignment. It's a Goldilocks situation - if the changes are too big or too small the logic doesn't need the height-assignment, which happens only when the changes are \"just right\". In fact, I've been unable to produce a fully-deterministic repro suitable for use in a test case; the \"just-rightness\" depends on the exact scrolling and virtualization history in a way that I've only seen in large datasets after non-deterministic scrolling (e.g. dragging the thumb when the data is so large that a single pixel of thumb motion corresponds to more than a screenful of data motion: extent.Height > viewport.Height^2 ).\r\n\r\nThe fix is to replace negative height by 0 in the height-assignment. This obviously avoids the crash, but it's not so obvious whether doing so can cause other problems later on. In the collection-change case, we only care whether the predicted extended viewport is taller than the last-computed one, we don't actually use the new height in any other way. So it's OK to use 0 instead of a negative number - they both have the same effect.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nCrash while adding/removing items from the underlying collection.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAd-hoc around customer scenario.\r\nStandard regression testing.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow.

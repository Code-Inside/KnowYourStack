You can drag the rectangle towards the canvas (using left mouse button). If you leave the rectangle's boundaries while dragging, the DragLeave event is fired and handled in the related handler in code-behind:</p><pre>private void Rectangle_OnPreviewDragLeave(object sender, DragEventArgs e)\n{\n    ...\n\n}</pre><p>Here I try to retrieve the relative position of the mouse pointer with:</p><pre>var givenPoint = e.GetPosition(sender as IInputElement);<br></pre><p>Furthermore I relocate the position of the text box (with name \"GetPositionValue\") to display the coords from the 'givenPoint' and set it's Text property to the 'givenPoint' value:</p><pre>Canvas.SetLeft(this.GetPositionValue, givenPoint.X);\nCanvas.SetTop(this.GetPositionValue, givenPoint.Y);\nthis.GetPositionValue.Text = givenPoint.ToString();<br></pre><p>As you can see (after dragging the rectangle towards the canvas), the textbox is located right at that point, where the mouse left the rectangle on the canvas.</p><p>That is, the point given by e.GetPosition(...) is relative to the Canvas(!), even if I gave the sender(i.e. the rectangle) as the InputElement. But the givenPoint's X-value for instance should be negative for leaving the rectangle to the left, etc. Otherwise in my opinion I can not decide, if the drag has left the rectangle's boundaries.</p><p>I hope that helped.</p><p>PS: I made the app very simple and short. Please ignore code style here.</p>\n\n#### Blair Wang [MSFT] on 7/22/2019, 07:38 AM: \n\nWe will close this report in 7 days because we don’t have enough information to investigate further.

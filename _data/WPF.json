If there's support for this, then a community hub request could be raised too.\n\nSo, there are a few parts to this, which I think are all related by the general idea...\n\nA lot of working with WPF XAML comes down to how the IDE works, which needs to have an understanding of the code it's operating on to provide useful suggestions. For very specific things this is extensible (for example putting an enum in your markup extension), but many features seem to be hard-coded to look for Markup elements like `Binding`, and `TemplateBinding`. Because of this, creating custom markups which rely on `PropertyPath` for example aren't very useful because there's no intellisense or validation, and the only way I can see to making that work extensibly is having attributes on the `MarkupExtension` property/parameter or `DependencyProperty` to instruct how the IDE should determine what intellisense to provide or how to behave. \n\nThere are already some XAML extensibility features the codebase, for example `TypeConverterAttribute`, `ContentPropertyAttribute` and `DictionaryKeyPropertyAttribute`, however if you use the last one, it [doesn't actually get recognised](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/7562). Adding `ContentProperty` to `Setter` has been a [long-awaited change](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/84) which keeps getting undone because of backwards compatibility.\n\nAlso, some things seem to be hard-coded by the compiler and/or IDE, like how only extensions derived from `StaticExtension`, `TypeExtension`, `ResourceKeyExtension` can be used as a resource key, even though in theory any `MarkupExtension` could provide an `object` value for a key. \n\nSimilarly, although C# analysers are now very easy to add yourself, there's no official way to implement analysers for XAML. \n\nA possible solution to both of these is 'write a visual studio extension' but that's a big ask for small teams and much easier said than done. The only one I know about is [RapidXaml](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit), and it's not yet been ported to VS 2022. The only other option is Resharper, which is extra and has its own entirely separate code inspection system.\n\nSo TLDR:\n- Make IDE intellisense features for XAML rely on annotations in WPF that can also be applied to custom types.\n- Make analysers for XAML (not necessarily just WPF) a first class feature to allow code and style validation (and automated fixes).\n\nI appreciate this is a huge amount of work, and probably needs breaking down, but it would be a good to get an idea of feasibility.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10610","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modularise IDE integration for better extensibility\" (#10610)"},{"Id":"2935925889","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T15:45:15","Actor":"bent-rasmussen","Number":"10609","RawContent":null,"Title":"Application crash on customer machine (Fluent Theme?)","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nOur company is now at the point where we want to release our app, built with the new Fluent theme.

new Fluent Theme, as we have not had this kind of crash before. Well, at least not with WPF...\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### Impact\n\nThe customer cannot use our application since it often crashes or freezes for them. We are unsure how many customers this affects, since we have not shipped the next major version with the Fluent Theme version yet - only a preview version.\n\nWe instructed the customer to update to the latest Windows version and update graphics drivers, since we have had issues with that before. The customer has done so but it has not resolved the issue.\n\n### Configuration\n\nFrom the customer:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d0845ba-7f68-4b92-b157-4e9083717b7a)\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10609","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Application crash on customer machine (Fluent Theme?)\" (#10609)"},{"Id":"2931290044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T10:53:37","Actor":"h3xds1nz","Number":"10602","RawContent":null,"Title":"[StyleCleanUp] Fix spacing around keywords (SA1000) ","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #10524 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFixes spacing around keywords as per `SA1000`, the only violations were in `System.Xaml`.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCleaner codebase for developers.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nLocal build.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/10602)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/10602","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[StyleCleanUp] Fix spacing around keywords (SA1000) \" (#10602)"},{"Id":"2934544914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T08:41:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"10607","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dnceng-bot] Branch `wpf/release/9.0` can't be merged to Azdo internal branch","State":"open","Body":"Branch [release/9.0](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/commits/release/9.0/) in `dotnet/wpf` repo can't be mirrored from GitHub to Azure [internal/release/9.0](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf?version=GBinternal%2Frelease%2F9.0&_a=history) via internal merge. \n\nThere are conflicting commits in the target branch.\nThe branch is configured to be mirrored via automated merge. \nThe situation is rare but normal.

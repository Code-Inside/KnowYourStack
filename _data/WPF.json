This is a regression from older themes like Aero and Classic, which provided clear, predictable focus feedback.\n\n### Why this is a design flaw\n\n- Users cannot determine which control will respond to the next key press.\n- Aero provided a clear visual indicator via `FocusVisualStyle` and animation.\n- Fluent omits this, leading to ambiguity and reduced accessibility.\n\n### Suggested Resolution\n\n- Reinstate visual feedback for `KeyboardFocus` in default templates.\n- Use `FocusVisualStyle` or `IsKeyboardFocused` triggers to provide consistent feedback.\n\n### Philosophical Note\n\nA UI that accepts input without revealing its focus state violates the principle of explicit responsibility modeling.

These applications (e.g., KeePass, OneDrive, etc.) normally appear in the system tray within ~25 seconds of logging in.\n\n>> I can provide Windows ADK Boot traces if needed (before and after installation) <<\n\nAfter this update is applied, it takes 2 minutes and 30 seconds for all startup applications to fully load and appear in the tray. This happens every time, even across multiple reboots.\n\nThe delay affects all startup programs equally — there is no single application causing a bottleneck. The system otherwise performs normally once everything is finally loaded.\n\nThe problem occurs regardless of installation method (Windows Update or manual installer from dotnet.microsoft.com) and persists even after uninstalling the runtime. Only restoring a clean system image resolves the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n🔁 Steps to Reproduce\n    Restore a clean system image with all updates except .NET 8.0.19.\n    Install .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.19 (via Windows Update or manual installer).\n    Reboot the system.\n    Log in and measure how long it takes for all system tray startup programs to appear.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n\n✅ Expected Behavior\nStartup applications appear in the system tray within ~25 seconds of logging into Windows.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n❌ Actual Behavior\nAfter installing .NET 8.0.19, it takes 2 minutes and 30 seconds for all startup programs to appear.\nThe delay is consistent and system-wide.\n\nUninstalling the runtime does not revert the behavior — only restoring a full system image resolves the issue.\n\n### Regression?\n\nThis appears to be a regression that significantly degrades the Windows startup experience.

However, due to Windows' mechanism, when operating on a non-primary screen, the method returns coordinates relative to the primary screen. This leads to issue #8517. The fix involves subtracting the Left and Top values of displayRect during the calculation, ensuring that the resulting coordinates are relative to the current screen rather than the primary screen, thereby resolving the touch offset problem.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nFix the bug.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\n<!-- Is this fixing a problem that was introduced in the most recent release, ie., fixing a regression? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- What kind of testing has been done with the fix. -->\r\nThe https://github.com/dotnet-campus/wpf/pull/9 was tested for two years in many my users device.

Tooltips in WPF V4.8 apps (and earlier versions) are not working in Windows 11 build 22598.100. They appear but then immediately disappear. It happens in all WPF based apps. Tooltips are ok in Winforms apps and also .NET 5.0 WPF apps are ok.\n\n...\n\n&gt; ... others have started seeing this too. It sounds like it might be related to high DPI displays and the Windows 11 preview (which includes a buggy .NET 4.8.1). \n\n...\n\n&gt; ... If I move the mouse over the Tooltip control and stop moving the mouse no problem. But if I move the mouse a minuscule amount the Tooltip disappears. This suggests the WPF Tooltip implementation display and close are controlled only by MouseMove events. Then, with the slightest of mouse movements (especially high-res displays) the Tooltip display is cancelled. Reducing display resolution improves the issue significantly, but not a satisfactory solution.\n\n...\n\nThere was also a simple reproduction example:\n\n&gt; To prove it I created a brand new WPF .NET 4.8 App, dragged on a button and added a tooltip.\n&gt;\n&gt; ```\n&gt; &lt;Grid&gt;\n&gt; &lt;Button ToolTip=\"Test Tooltip\" Content=\"Button\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"92,60,0,0\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\"/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&gt; ```\n&gt;\n&gt; The tooltip displays very briefly then disappears, far too quick to read. It happens in all WPF .NET 4 apps regardless of how complex they are. From the very simplest (shown above) to much more complex apps evolved over 10 years. WFP app with .NET 5/6 and WinForms are working fine.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### David Hollman on 8/4/2025, 08:00 PM: \n\n<p><a target='_blank' href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10015\">https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10015</a> is the same / similar</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 8/5/2025, 10:41 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Given the requirements, we have to sometimes manually manipulate tooltips from code behid by openning and closing them. As it turned out, tooltips become shamely broken when you touch their `IsOpen` property. This is one of such bugs that can clearly be reproduced in a minimalistic setup\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a default WPF app\n2. Content of `MainWidow.xaml` (this is just to make a tooltip with somewhat decent area so that wrong behavior is more visible):\n```xaml\n<Window x:Class=\"TestWPFTooltips.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:TestWPFTooltips\"\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\n    <StackPanel HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\">\n        <Button Padding=\"10\" Content=\"Press me\">\n            <Button.ToolTip>\n                <ToolTip Opened=\"ToolTip_Opened\">\n                    <TextBlock Padding=\"10\">\n                        Test\n                    </TextBlock>\n                </ToolTip>\n            </Button.ToolTip>\n        </Button>\n    </StackPanel>\n</Window>\n```\n3. Content of `MainWindow.xaml.cs`:\n```cs\nusing System.Windows;\nusing System.Windows.Controls;\n\nnamespace TestWPFTooltips;\n\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n    public MainWindow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    private async void ToolTip_Opened(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        await Task.Delay(3000);\n\n        var tooltip = (ToolTip)sender;\n\n        if (tooltip.IsOpen)\n        {\n            tooltip.IsOpen = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen a tooltip is closed from code behind it continues behaving as usual so that closing from code behind and closing from \"natural\" behavior is the same thing\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nAfter the tooltip is closed from code behind it still \"thinks\" it occupies its rea, so that when you move your mouse over that area and return to the target element tooltip is not automatically opened again. However, if you move your mouse somewhere else and return to the target element the tooltip is opened correctly:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae0cc68-aeb1-464c-b9fd-14acb7563b73)\n\n### Regression?\n\nTested on .NET 8, 9 and 10 P6, so probably not (we are not interested in .NET Framework behavior since our app is running on .NET 8)\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\nOn the tooltip target subscribe to `MouseEnter` and `MouseLeave` events and open/close tooltip manually from code behind to restore built-in behavior\n\n### Impact\n\nI have to waste my dev time to fix basic UI behavior instead of focusing on product-related features\n\n### Configuration\n\n.NET 8/9/10P6\nWindows 10 22H2 19045.5371 x64\nI don't think this is tied to the OS/CPU architecture\n\n### Other information\n\n_No

WritableBitmap","State":"open","Body":"I'm developing a large-scale application with a custom rendering system. The system has a dedicated rendering thread that draws a specific region of a virtual canvas into a temporary memory buffer. Then, in the `OnRender()` method, I use `WritableBitmap.WritePixels()` to update the image content, and draw it to a specified screen region using `DrawingContext.DrawImage()`\n\nDuring user interactions such as mouse dragging, the draw region changes in real time, but the actual image content is not necessarily updated on every `OnRender()` call.\n\nI've noticed that occasionally, the image content does not match the drawn region, resulting in visible \"jumps\" or flickering during dragging. This issue is especially noticeable on my 4K display with integrated graphics, full-screen window, where the flickering happens frequently.\n\nInterestingly, I encountered the same issue when previously using `InteropBitmap`, which also involves a updating image data mechanism. This leads me to believe the issue is related to how images with such updating mechanisms.\n\nWhen I switched to creating a new `BitmapSource` in every 'OnRender()' call and drawing it directly—without using `WritableBitmap`—the issue disappeared entirely. This strongly suggests that `WritableBitmap.WritePixels()` is not synchronized with the `OnRender()` pipeline under certain conditions.\n\nI also tried using `Dispatcher.Invoke` with `DispatcherPriority.Render` to call `WritePixels()`, but the problem persists.\n\nIt seems that under heavy rendering load, the image updated by `WritePixels()` might not be synchronized with the draw operation in `OnRender()`, leading to this visual mismatch.\n\nHow can I avoid this timing issue while still using `WritableBitmap`?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/11025","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flickering when updating WritableBitmap\" (#11025)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-08-18T03:30:26.5523685Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":475}

This seems like a caching issue in the sense that once the brush is evaluated for the first control, the  values of gradient stops are cached by the brush and they are not being reevaluated for other controls where the brush is used.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n**Here are the steps to repro the issue :**\n\n1. Define a LinearGradientBrush like following in your resources : \n```\n<LinearGradientBrush x:Key=\"FaultyBorderBrush\" MappingMode=\"Absolute\"  StartPoint=\"0,0\" EndPoint=\"0,3\">\n    <LinearGradientBrush.RelativeTransform>\n        <ScaleTransform ScaleY=\"-1\" CenterY=\"0.5\" />\n    </LinearGradientBrush.RelativeTransform>\n    <LinearGradientBrush.GradientStops>\n        <GradientStop Offset=\"0.33\" Color=\"Red\" />\n        <GradientStop Offset=\"1.0\" Color=\"Orange\" />\n    </LinearGradientBrush.GradientStops>\n</LinearGradientBrush>\n```\n\n2. Now create multiple elements in your window which use the Brush ( make sure they have varying sizes ) like this : \n```\n    <StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\">\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"50\" Width=\"50\"/>\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"100\" Width=\"50\"/>\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"30\" Width=\"50\"/>\n    </StackPanel>\n```\n3. Run the application. You will get something like this on the screen : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d54fef95-3c3a-4b42-b236-ef5dcc4dd0c4)\n\n4. Now just reorder the elements in your application, Here is what I did ( just moved border with height 30 to first position )\n```\n    <StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\">\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"30\" Width=\"50\"/>\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"50\" Width=\"50\"/>\n        <Border Margin=\"20\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource FaultyBorderBrush}\" \n                BorderThickness=\"10\" Height=\"100\" Width=\"50\"/>\n    </StackPanel>\n```\n\n5. Run the application and observe : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d715ef8-b306-42b7-9450-a7e5cca23939)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIn respect to the above example, every control no matter the height should have a red color at the bottom of the border.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe brush is getting cached according to the first brush and gradient stops are not being calculated again.\n\n### Regression?\n\nDon't know. Looks like a long standing issue.\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\nCan avoid using Absolute MappingMode for the brush.\n\n### Impact\n\n_No response_\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Which version of .NET is the code running on?  :   .NET 9 and 10\n- What OS and version, and what distro if applicable?  :   Windows 11\n- What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?  : Tried with x64\n- Do you know whether it is specific to that configuration? : Don't think so.\n\n### Other information\n\nI discussed this issue with @miloush around half an year ago, but raising the issue got delayed from my end.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10502","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected behavior when using LinearGradientBrush + RelativeTransform\" (#10502)"},{"Id":"2877241474","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-25T07:19:09","Actor":"siagupta0202","Number":"10500","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Fluent] Add missing style for StatusBarItem","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10500","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Fluent] Add missing style for StatusBarItem\" (#10500)"},{"Id":"2877281808","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-25T07:19:07","Actor":"siagupta0202","Number":"10501","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adds style for StatusBarItem in fluent","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #10500 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nA StatusBarItem is a specialized container used within a StatusBar to display status information.

Create a .NET 9 WPF project named as WpfDemo.\n2. Install package Syncfusion.Themes.Windows11Light.WPF 28.2.5 and Syncfusion.SfGrid.WPF 28.2.5.\n3. Copy the following code to MainWindow.xaml.cs:\n```\nusing System.Windows;\nusing Syncfusion.SfSkinManager;\nnamespace WpfDemo\n{\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window\n    {\n        public MainWindow()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            SfSkinManager.SetTheme(this, new Theme(\"Windows11Light\"));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n4. Create class ViewModel.cs:\n```\nnamespace WpfDemo\n{\n    class ViewModel\n    {\n        public ViewModel()\n        {\n            this.Test = new List<string>();\n        }\n        private List<string> _test;\n\n        public List<string> Test\n        {\n            get { return _test; }\n            set { _test = value; }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n5. Copy the following code to MainWindow.xaml:\n```\n<Window x:Class=\"WpfDemo.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WpfDemo\"\n        xmlns:syncfusion=\"http://schemas.syncfusion.com/wpf\"\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\n    <Window.DataContext>\n        <local:ViewModel />\n    </Window.DataContext>\n    <StackPanel>\n        <syncfusion:SfDataGrid ItemsSource=\"{Binding Test}\"/>\n    </StackPanel>\n</Window>\n```\n6. Build the project.\n7.

https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/5958\r\n\r\nMain PR <!-- Link to PR if any that fixed this in the main branch. -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Give a brief summary of the issue and how the pull request is fixing it. -->\r\nRoslyn's MSBuildWorkspace, Roslyn LSP ProjectSystem, and (possibly) CPS used in C# DevKit do not want to set BuildingInsideVisualStudio because of all the unknown compatibility issues that might create. By adding the \r\nDesignTimeMarkupCompilation to CoreCompile when a DesignTimeBuild is being performed we will be able to provide our users the ability to open WPF projects and have a good editing experience.\r\n\r\nLooks like a previous PR (https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1895) enabled this for CPS within VisualStudio and this hopes to do the same for project systems outside VS.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n<!-- What is the impact to customers of not taking this fix? -->\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/1018, https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/5958\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\n<!-- Is this fixing a problem that was introduced in the most recent release, ie., fixing a regression? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- What kind of testing has been done with the fix. -->\r\nMSBuildWorkspace has been basically running with this fix for a year ([see PR](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/20ba0dd7e8ff0352e6ab21ccd3b60f0022354a4d)) as it checks whether the DesignTimeMarkupCompilation target exists and runs it. We have not gotten any negative feedback from that change.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n<!-- Please assess the risk of taking this fix. Provide details backing up your assessment. -->\r\nBased on an equivalent change being in Roslyn for a year. I would think the risk was low.\r\n\r\nWould love to see this back ported to .NET 8 and 9 as it would enable users on those SDK to open WPF projects.\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/10489)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/10489","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Run DesignTimeMarkupCompilation when DesignTimeBuild is set.\" (#10489)"},{"Id":"2865084581","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-21T06:44:46","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:840bf684-917a-4879-f62c-08d8e93a0c51)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\n- **Subscription**: 840bf684-917a-4879-f62c-08d8e93a0c51\n- **Build**: 20250219.2\n- **Date Produced**: February 19, 2025 5:41:49 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: 11f89f03a41eefcc60e278d0fc96b63b175e4527\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

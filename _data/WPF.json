Instead, the PresentationBuildTasks.dll from GAC, i.e., the DLL that shipped with .NET Framework, is being used for builds instead.\r\n\r\nThis is because the *first* occurance of an `UsingTask` element that applies to a `TaskName` will always be used - it can not be overridden by subsequent `UsingTask` entries (this is unlike `Property` and `Item` behavior). See note in https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/master/docs/msbuild/usingtask-element-msbuild.md immediate after the **Syntax** section (Note: The msbuild team added this note after identifying this behavior as part of investiaging this PresentationBuildTasks.dll issue).\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures that the `UsingTask` declarations supplied by the WindowsDesktop SDK precede those supplied by .NET Framework's copy of `Microsoft.WinFX.targets` by introducing a new `.props` file - `Microsoft.WinFX.props` - and moving a small number of `Property` and `UsingTask` declartions into it. Since `.props` are imported before `targets`, the `UsingTask` declarations supplied by WindowsDesktop SDK will thus take precedence.\r\n\r\nNote that `Pbt.props` is used only for building this repo - it doesn't ship. \r\n\r\nAddresses #1998 \r\nThis needs to be ported to release/3.1 and release/3.0 (servicing).

Addin projects are WPF applications and are responsible to generate their ribbon menu and content. The problem I'm facing is that when the Ribbon control is transformed through MAF pipeline using FrameworkElementAdapters.ElementToContractAdapter and then back to FrameworkElement using FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToElementAdapter, it loses &quot; some&quot; functionality. I want to host this converted Ribbon on the Host side and when I collapse/expand the ribbon control, the parent grid doesn't reclaim the height. Expected behavior is that when the ribbon is collapsed the RowHeight of the Grid's RowDefinition should collapse and when the ribbon gets expanded, the RowDefinition should also expand. The issue is with Expandable controls, like Ribbon and Expander. Images are attached with the post for Desired and Undesired behavior, and a sample project is also attached herewitht he post re-produce the issue quickly.

This was always the case in .NET Framework given the fact that WPF's application template set this attribute by default. \r\n\r\nIn .NET core, we inadvertently dropped this attribute from the application project-templates (they are still correctly retained by the .NET Core _User Control_ and _Custom Control_ project templates). \r\n\r\nThis can certainly be worked-around by a developer by adding an attribute in a `.cs` files, but identifying the cause of app misbehavior (owing to the missing `ThemeInfo` attribute in itself would be a confusing and difficult process. This is a confusion we would very much like to prevent in the ecosystem. \r\n\r\n### Regression \r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow. (a) Does not impact WPF product (isolated to project templates), and (b) easy to test the locally built project templates. \r\n\r\nNote that the fix to the VB project template in this branch is for completeness' sake only.

If something like the designer asks for output groups, then the build for that could be combined with the build that produces the intellisense file, but getting output groups sets `BuildingProject `to `true`, which in turn prevents WPF's markup-compilation from running.\r\n\r\nThis change works around the issue by allowing the intellisense files to generate irrespective of the value of `BuildingProject `, as long we're doing a design time build.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nDevelopers encountering this problem see the following error: \r\n\r\n```\r\nError: ‘CS0103 - The name ‘InitializeComponent’ does not exist in the current context’\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is usually persistent and doesn't go away upon rebuilds.

This code works fine in the DotNetFramework and triggers all of the appropriate events such as PreviewKeyDown, KeyDown, PreviewTextInput, TextInput, PreviewKeyUp, and KeyUp. \r\n\r\nThe same code does not work in NetCore. No events are fired. \r\n\r\nI have attached  sample solution here which contains two projects. One is using the DotNetFramework (DNFApp) and the other is using NetCore (NCApp). Both projects share the same code files. \r\n\r\nIf you run the DNFApp and click the button, the Output window shows that all of the appropriate events are fired on the Button control. \r\n\r\nRun the NCApp and click the button, the Output window shows that the button click fires, and nothing else. If you press a keym such as (\"F\") on the keyboard, all of the events fire. \r\n\r\n[SendInputTest.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/files/3682752/SendInputTest.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1993","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SendInput API does not work on WPF NetCore controls\" (#1993)"},{"Id":"501455712","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-02T13:08:16","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1992","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n## From https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf-int\r\n- **Build**: 20191002.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/2/2019 8:22 AM\r\n- **Commit**: e899060baa974bbe2be536e45b7548c3afb5a063\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf.DncEng** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19502.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1992","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int\" (#1992)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-10-09T05:30:56.8589698Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":539}

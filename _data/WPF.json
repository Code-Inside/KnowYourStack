This was all done in high level libraries.\r\n\r\nFor WPF to use the **same** solution, it would seem this would need to be done in WPF.\r\n\r\nIf the runtime was to implement a **similar** solution, it would need to introduce a new (similar) attribute to the NetCoreApp API surface.\r\n\n\n---\n\n@azchohfi commented on [Tue Jan 15 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34562#issuecomment-454466469)\n\nExactly.

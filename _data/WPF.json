After using Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager to create the folder, I tried using Visual Studio (2019) to build the web site. My 1st attempt failed, and I was instructed - I believe by a Visual Studio diagnostic - that I would have to run Visual Studio in Administrative mode. I tried again after restarting Visual Studio in Administrative Mode, and the Build was successful. But, from then on I was unable to reopen Visual Studio without Administrative Mode: the diagnostic was displayed in an ordinary popup box with an OK button, and with the text “Cannot write to folder C:\\user\\sncole\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\WPF. Access is denied”.\n(It is possible that I caused this error when I tried to reopen Visual Studio before closing it while it was in Administrative Mode.)\nI used Google Search extensively to try to find some other user with a similar experience; no luck. Finally - a day later - I stumbled on a work-around. I tried to open C:\\user\\sncole\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\WPF with Windows Explorer; Windows Explorer similarly informed me that access was denied, but it asked me whether I wanted to override the access denial. I said “yes”, and I was allowed to view the contents of C:\\user\\sncole\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\WPF. Since then I no longer need Administrative mode to open Visual Studio.\n\n\nThe issue here is that a WPF folder is getting created in the temp directly with wrong ACLs.

description:**\r\nDo a File > New Project > WPF App (.NET Core 3.1), In MainWindow.xaml, paste the following code:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Window\r\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\r\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\r\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\r\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WpfApp1NetCore31\"\r\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\r\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\r\n    <StackPanel Orientation=\"Vertical\">\r\n        <TextBlock x:Name=\"TextBlock1\">\r\n            <TextBlock.Inlines>\r\n                <Run FontWeight=\"Bold\" Text=\"Formatted\" />\r\n                <Run FontWeight=\"Bold\" Foreground=\"Red\" Text=\"Text\" />\r\n            </TextBlock.Inlines>\r\n        </TextBlock>\r\n        <TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Text, Source={x:Reference TextBlock1}}\" />\r\n    </StackPanel>\r\n</Window>\r\n```\r\n \r\n **Actual behavior:**\r\nThe second TextBlock text is empty. Inspecting the first TextBlock shows the Text property an empty string. Now very randomly, sometimes it returns the string \"Formatted Text\", but I haven't been able to reproduce it.\r\n \r\n **Expected behavior:**\r\nThe documented behavior: TextBlock.Text should contain a textual representation of the contents of the Inlines.\r\n\r\nIf you explicitly set the Text Property on the first TextBlock, only the explicitly set Text is mirrored in the second TextBlock.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong ?

Everything is OK with the file.\r\nThen I copy the file to a SharePoint online. It doesn't matter, if I copy via a WebDAV path, a SharePoint website on a browser or the latest possibility via OneDrive. \r\nSubsequently the behavior of that file varies:\r\nPowerpoint opens the file without problems. \r\nWinRar opens the file and any included data file without problems.\r\n7-Zip opens the file but shows header errors for some included presentation CustomXml itemProperty files.\r\nOpen Xml SDK 2.5 Productivity Tool for Microsoft Office cannot open the file, shows \"Cannot open the file. The file contains corrupted data.\"\r\nFrom code the DocumentFormat.OpenXml Api cannot open the file, throws an System.IO.FileFormatException \"The file contains corrupted data.\" \r\nOpening and saving the \"corrupted\" pptx file with Powerpoint has a healing effect on the file and it can be used with all mentioned programs without any problems. This is our current workaround. But that's not really satisfying. \r\nBut after some further inquiries, I found out that it is the used zipper that has a problem with the data in presentation.pptx file. The error's stacktrace shows that the first error is thrown in the Validate method of the ZipIOLocalFileBlock object:\r\n` bei MS.Internal.IO.Zip.ZipIOLocalFileBlock.Validate(String fileName, ZipIOCentralDirectoryBlock centralDir, ZipIOCentralDirectoryFileHeader centralDirFileHeader)\r\n   bei MS.Internal.IO.Zip.ZipIOLocalFileBlock.SeekableLoad(ZipIOBlockManager blockManager, String fileName)\r\n   bei MS.Internal.IO.Zip.ZipIOBlockManager.LoadLocalFileBlock(String zipFileName)\r\n   bei MS.Internal.IO.Zip.ZipArchive.GetFile(String zipFileName)\r\n   bei MS.Internal.IO.Zip.ZipArchive.GetFiles()\r\n   bei System.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage.ContentTypeHelper..ctor(ZipArchive zipArchive, IgnoredItemHelper ignoredItemHelper)\r\n   bei System.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Boolean streaming)\r\n   bei System.IO.Packaging.Package.Open(String path, FileMode packageMode, FileAccess packageAccess, FileShare packageShare, Boolean streaming)\r\n   bei System.IO.Packaging.Package.Open(String path, FileMode packageMode, FileAccess packageAccess, FileShare packageShare)\r\n   bei DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage.OpenCore(String path, Boolean readWriteMode)\r\n   bei DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.PresentationDocument.Open(String path, Boolean isEditable, OpenSettings openSettings)\r\n   bei DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.PresentationDocument.Open(String path, Boolean isEditable)`\r\n\r\nWith my last inquiries I found out, that opening the same file in a .NET core application which uses DocumentFormat.OpenXml SDK V 2.10 which itselfs uses System.IO.Compression is runnig without any errors.\r\nIt seems, that there is already a fix in the core environment for this problem.\r\nUnfortunately I cannot change to the core variant because the code is running in a Powerpoint AddIn environment.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKarl","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2676","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ZipIOLocalFileBlock validation reports corrupted file while System.IO.Compression does not\" (#2676)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-03-04T05:30:54.3746114Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":814}

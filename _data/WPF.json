Tooltips may be expensive to show/render\r\n2. Tooltips may cover other content\r\n\r\nIMHO: I think it's a sad decision from Microsoft to introduce new behavior and then only allow internal consumers to change that behavior while affecting every app which uses tooltips. As the internal usage shows you fully understood that this behavior is not always the desired behavior, but still decided to make it impossible for everyone else to opt out of it.\r\n \r\n **Actual behavior:**\r\nTooltips show on keyboard focus.\r\n \r\n **Expected behavior:**\r\nTooltips should not show on keyboard focus by default, IMHO.\r\nThe behavior must be controllable through a dependency property.\r\n \r\n **Minimal repro:**\r\n1.

However, because of PreserveSig = false, this is now specified as:\r\n\r\nBOOL DwmIsCompositionEnabled(void);\r\n\r\nBut mono doesn't support PreserveSig = false for dllimports, and so wine-mono (which also relies on wpf) doesn't either. When this native function is called, the PreserveSig is ignored, so it calls the second version, which is wrong.\r\n\r\nFor a 64-bit application (such as the one described below), since no parameter was supplied (it's empty / void), it will have whatever value rcx was had when it was invoked, due to the MS x64 ABI. In my particular case, it had the value rcx=0x00000000FFFFFFFF.\r\n\r\nThis was used as the \"BOOL *enabled\" pointer, which is an invalid address. wine's DwmIsCompositionEnabled then tried to write a value of FALSE to this address, which causes a crash. (it's not wine's fault here, it was simply supplied an invalid pointer due to wrong signature, even though the function always returns FALSE, it shouldn't be a problem).\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be to do the same as was done for the imported native DwmGetColorizationColor API—use the correct signature with PreserveSig = true, and call the API with its correct signature.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: This happened while trying to get the launcher working for the game Divinity: Original Sin II Definitive Edition with wine-mono. Note that there are several issues with it right now, and just this patch isn't enough, but to get to this bug, the following patches (PRs) are also needed on mono first:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/mono/pull/20831\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/mono/pull/20832\r\n\r\nThere's another fix for wine-mono required before this bug can be reproduced, but a workaround is to simply set the environment variable before launching it: MONO_THREADS_SUSPEND=preemptive\r\n\r\nAfter this, it will arrive at this bug, i.e. crash in native DwmIsCompositionEnabled due to the wrong pointer supplied.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/4166","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"A WPF application running on Wine (on Linux) via wine-mono will crash when calling DwmIsCompositionEnabled due to PreserveSig = false.\" (#4166)"},{"Id":"805204129","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-10T06:35:59","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"4162","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/winforms\r\n- **Subscription**: 256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126\r\n- **Build**: 20210209.9\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/10/2021 5:55 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 9749f43267fcc402230abfe3ec331686229ef107\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Dotnet.WinForms.ProjectTemplates**: [from 6.0.0-preview.2.21109.4 to 6.0.0-preview.2.21109.9][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.Winforms**: [from 6.0.0-preview.2.21109.4 to 6.0.0-preview.2.21109.9][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/compare/958040c...9749f43\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/4162","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms\" (#4162)"},{"Id":"805217933","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-10T06:28:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"4164","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.1' => 'master'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.1 branch which have not been merged yet to master.

No\r\n\r\n **Problem description:**\r\n Custom fonts (tested with both OTF and TTF formats) are not displayed in WPF applications. I spoke with several developers, who advised creating a bug report. \r\nWhen the URI is valid, the designer preview window will successfully display the font in Visual Studio, but when running the application, the font falls back to a Microsoft default.\r\nBuild action is set to Embedded Resource, and has been tested with multiple other font files.\r\n\r\n **Actual behavior:**\r\n WPF application falls back to a Microsoft font, while VS designer preview shows the intended font: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32360252/107451496-50582e00-6b3f-11eb-881b-aadbd72d30c8.png)\r\n \r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n The intended font should be displayed in the application. \r\n\r\n **Minimal repro:**\r\nI created a [minimal repository to test](https://github.com/TMGMike/WPF-Font-Test), and it occurs there too. This was tested in both .NET 5.0, and .NET Core 3.1, as well as .NET Framework 4.8, although in Framework 4.8, the designer also fails to show the intended font.

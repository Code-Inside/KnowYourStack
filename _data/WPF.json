In this library, they define many `const` fields that they use in attributes, element names, etc. For example:\r\n```cs\r\n[TemplateVisualState(Name = MyState, GroupName = MyStateGroup)]\r\nclass MyControl : Control\r\n{\r\n   public const String MyState = \"MyState\";\r\n   public const String MyStateGroup = \"MyStateGroup\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- somewhere inside of a control template -->\r\n<VisualStateGroup Name=\"{x:Static local:MyControl.MyState}\">...</VisualStateGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework tooling works fine here. However, in .NET Core, trying to compile code using this pattern produces this error:\r\n\r\n> error MC3079: MarkupExtensions are not allowed for Uid or Name property values, so '{x:Static local:MyControl.MyState}' is not valid.\r\n\r\n[Here's a small repro that demonstrates this issue.](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/files/2897472/Repro.zip) The application will compile fine if you set the target framework to `net472`, but it will not compile with the above error if you set it to `netcoreapp3.0`.\r\n\r\nNote that this pattern doesn't work in all cases; I don't know the specifics on where it does and doesn't work, but I think it only works for files evaluated at runtime.

This was all done in high level libraries.\r\n\r\nFor WPF to use the **same** solution, it would seem this would need to be done in WPF.\r\n\r\nIf the runtime was to implement a **similar** solution, it would need to introduce a new (similar) attribute to the NetCoreApp API surface.\r\n\n\n---\n\n@azchohfi commented on [Tue Jan 15 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34562#issuecomment-454466469)\n\nExactly.

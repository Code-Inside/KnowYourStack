The first reason is that its owner gets removed from the tree after the right-button-up gesture but before the PopupControlService initiates the display logic. The logic notices that the owner is not being displayed, and therefore doesn't display the context menu. This is by design - you shouldn't display a context menu for an element that isn't itself visible.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the (shared) context menu is in a bad state, where it's marked IsOpen=true, but isn't actually being displayed. The display logic doesn't do anything, since it thinks the menu is already open. This is a bug, left over from the first case, which doesn't reset IsOpen to false when it aborts the display logic. The net effect is that once a context menu doesn't open because of reason 1, it will never open again, even in cases where it should.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to reset the context menu's state when aborting the display logic.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nContextMenus stop working\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAd-hoc around customer scenario.\r\nStandard regression testing.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow.

The first reason is that its owner gets removed from the tree after the right-button-up gesture but before the PopupControlService initiates the display logic. The logic notices that the owner is not being displayed, and therefore doesn't display the context menu. This is by design - you shouldn't display a context menu for an element that isn't itself visible.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the (shared) context menu is in a bad state, where it's marked IsOpen=true, but isn't actually being displayed. The display logic doesn't do anything, since it thinks the menu is already open. This is a bug, left over from the first case, which doesn't reset IsOpen to false when it aborts the display logic. The net effect is that once a context menu doesn't open because of reason 1, it will never open again, even in cases where it should.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to reset the context menu's state when aborting the display logic.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nContextMenus stop working\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAd-hoc around customer scenario.\r\nStandard regression testing.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow.

The control becomes momentarily unresponsive during the transition, and the final layout takes additional time to render. This is especially visible when using grid-like layouts (e.g., WrapPanel or UniformGrid) and higher row/column density.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0e0f229-8271-4d23-8e56-2d0f4184340b\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1.Run the attached sample application.\n2.Click the \"Load Items\" button to load the initial set of items (count = 50).\nNote: The control loads these items in less than a second (time shown in the dialog).\n3.Using the ComboBox, select 50 × 50 to load 2,500 items.\n4.Observe that the ListBox control takes significantly more time to update the items and render the layout.\n\nThe total time taken is approximately 10 seconds, and sometimes it can take up to 20 seconds.\n\n[ListBox_PerformanceIssue.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23854043/ListBox_PerformanceIssue.zip)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWe expect the control to take only a few seconds to update the layout, including rendering, even when switching to a higher item count.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe control takes around 10 seconds, and sometimes more than 20 seconds, to update the layout and render the items when switching to a higher item count.\n\n### Regression?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\n_No response_\n\n### Configuration\n\nOS: Windows 11 \n.NET / .NET Framework:  .NET Framework 4.8\nUI Framework: WPF\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/11294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"UI layout update delay when increasing item count (switching from lower to higher counts)\" (#11294)"},{"Id":"3670794146","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T10:30:24","Actor":"SubashiniMahendran","Number":"11293","RawContent":null,"Title":"Color.GetHue value return different value based on framework in WPF platform","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nI created an application that includes a ColorHelper class which computes a color value for a SolidColorBrush based on its opacity.

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Wpf` dependency, but [they think it is more of a WPF issue](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/32812#issuecomment-3569523717)\n\nWith `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Wpf` version `10.0.10` and `10.0.11`, resizing the window produces tons of flickering of the Webview content alternating between rendered and a blank content

resizing at the right time. Even if the content is there when resizing is stopped, the overall experience looks terrible.\n\nVersion `9.0.120` does not have this problem.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9af5cd2b-af1d-4eeb-bc44-fcdf0434b305\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d58cbb6-a9c2-42b1-b28e-48262d92b82c\n\n\nUsing plain non-Blazor Webview, in the form of WebView2CompositionControl, does not exhibit this behavior.\n\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n\n\t<PropertyGroup>\n\t\t<OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>\n\t\t<TargetFramework>net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework>\n\t\t<Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n\t\t<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n\t\t<UseWPF>true</UseWPF>\n\t\t<RootNamespace>WebViewBug</RootNamespace>\n\t</PropertyGroup>\n\n\t<ItemGroup>\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Web.WebView2\" Version=\"1.0.3595.46\" />\n\t        <!-- <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Web.WebView2\" Version=\"1.0.3179.45\" /> -->\n\t</ItemGroup>\n\n</Project>\n```\n```xaml\n<Window x:Class=\"WebViewBug.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n        xmlns:wv2=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Wpf;assembly=Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Wpf\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WebViewBug\"\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\n    <DockPanel>\n        <!--<wv2:WebView2 Name=\"webView\"\n                      Source=\"https://www.microsoft.com\" />-->\n\n        <wv2:WebView2CompositionControl Source=\"https://www.microsoft.com\" />\n    </DockPanel>\n</Window>\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47bebc49-7971-4516-9f7a-f3523d7cbc96\n\n\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nReproducible with out of the box Blazor Hybrid WPF app.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/wpf\n\n```xaml\n<Window x:Class=\"WindowFlicker.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WindowFlicker\"\n        xmlns:blazor=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation/blazor\"\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\n    <DockPanel>\n        <blazor:BlazorWebView HostPage=\"wwwroot\\index.html\"\n                              Services=\"{DynamicResource services}\">\n            <blazor:BlazorWebView.RootComponents>\n                <blazor:RootComponent Selector=\"#app\"\n                                      ComponentType=\"{x:Type local:Counter}\" />\n            </blazor:BlazorWebView.RootComponents>\n        </blazor:BlazorWebView>\n    </DockPanel>\n</Window>\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo flickering as it was before the switch to `WebView2CompositionControl` in .NET 10 \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nFlickering, rendering blank intermittently \n\n### Regression?\n\nYes.

The problem is that `ReflectionUtils.GetAssemblyPartialName` returns a `ReadOnlySpan<char>` when built using .Net 10 while in the .Net Framework build it returns a `string`. The problem is that comparison were not changed to replace `==` with `Equals` or something else and `==` on a `ReadOnlySpan<>` only compares the reference not the content (See [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlyspan-1.op_equality?view=net-10.0#remarks)). The means that even if 2 `ReadOnlySpan<char>` had the same content the `==` comparison could return false if the 2 spans don't point to the same memory address.\r\n\r\nI fixed the issue by replacing `==` with [MemoryExtensions.Equals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memoryextensions.equals?view=net-10.0#system-memoryextensions-equals(system-readonlyspan((system-char))-system-readonlyspan((system-char))-system-stringcomparison)) on .Net 10 and [String.Equals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.equals?view=net-10.0#system-string-equals(system-string-system-stringcomparison)) on .Net Framework.

A compiler error occurs when you reference a project that uses MessagePack with source generators in a WPF user control library that contains XAML.\n\nIf you build the project you will see the the following compiler error in the WPF project\n`MessagePackNotFound.UserControlsLib` generated by `Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.MarkupCompilePass1` from `PresentationBuildTasks.dll`:\n\n> Microsoft.WinFX.targets(211,9): Error MC1000 : Unknown build error, 'Could not find assembly 'MessagePack,\n> Version=3.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b4a0369545f0a1be'. Either explicitly load this assembly using a\n> method such as LoadFromAssemblyPath() or use a MetadataAssemblyResolver that returns a valid assembly.'\n\nThese conditions must be met for the error to occur:\n\n1. A project (`CommonLib`) references and uses MessagePack.\n2. MessagePack generates source code in `CommonLib` using its source generators.\n3. `CommonLib` references the MessagePack nuget package with\n   `<PrivateAssets>Analyzers; Build; ContentFiles; Compile</PrivateAssets>`\n\n   _!! The goal behind this `<PrivateAssets>` is to hide the MessagePack public APIs from anynone using the\n   `CommonLib` nuget package.\n   That `CommonLib` uses MessagePack under the hood is purely an implementation detail and\n   MessagePack should not become part of the public API of `CommonLib`. !!_\n4. `CommonLib` is referenced by a WPF project (`UserControlsLib`) that contains XAML that needs to be compiled.\n\nThis has to do something with the code that is generated by the MessagePack source generators. As soon as MessagePack generates code (that is all internal) inside of `CommonLib`, `Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.MarkupCompilePass1` wants to load `MessagePack.dll` wen compiling the XAML. Even though there are no types of MessagePack in the public API of `CommonLib`. \n\n- If you downgrade MessagePack from `3.1.4` to `2.5.198`, the problem will go away because the older version of MessagePack did not have source generators.\n- If you remove the attribute `[MessagePackObject(AllowPrivate = true)]` from the `Dto` class in `CommonLib`, the\n  problem will go away, because then no source code is generated by the source generators of MessagePack.\n- If you remove the private assets element (`<PrivateAssets>Analyzers; Build; ContentFiles; Compile</PrivateAssets>`)  from the MessagePack package reference in `MessagePackNotFound.CommonLib.csproj`, the problem will go away, because `MessagePack.dll` can now be found.\n\nFor testing, this repo also contains an `App` that references `UserControlsLib` as a nuget package.

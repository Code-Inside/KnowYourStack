The solution is to have an ObservableCollection with the data, wrap it into CollectionViewSource which in turn will be ItemsSource for the DataGrid. Subtotal is calculated with a converter, which receives Items of CollectionViewGroup as input and calculates the sum.</p><p>All works fine only at the initial population of the ObservableCollection, or when adding an item creates the new group. But if an item is added into any existing group, converter is simply not called for recalculation - apparently CollectionViewGroup.Items is not raising PropertyChanged event!</p><p>I browsed a bit in <a href=\"https://referencesource.microsoft.com/PresentationFramework/src/Framework/System/Windows/Data/CollectionViewGroup.cs.html\" target=_blank>CollectionViewGroup.cs source</a> - Items are ReadOnlyObservableCollection&lt;object&gt;, which should trigger PropertyChanged after an item added, shouldn't it?</p><p>Then I noticed, that CollectionViewGroup.ItemCount is displayed properly after adding new items, so I tried a trick with a MultiBinding - added an IMultiValueConverter converter which takes both Items and ItemCount as parameters, expecting ItemCount to trigger the recalculation. I  worked, but again without full success - somehow the converter gets the correct input only once, when the new group is created. If an item was added to an existing group, ItemCount is correct, but Items are not! Items collection is missing the newly added item! E.g. when ItemCount=2, Items have only 1 &quot;old&quot; item (Items.Count=1). When ItemCount=3, Items have only 2 &quot;old&quot; items (Items.Count=2), etc. So again the converter cannot calculate the correct subtotal, because the input is incomplete...</p><p>It looks  like the only working solution would be calling Refresh() for the whole CollectionViewSource, but that expands all the groups, cause flickering, breaks MVVM concept, so it is ugly...</p><p>So my questions are:</p><ul><li>Is there still any change to make CollectionViewGroup.Items raise PropertyChanged properly?</li><li>Isn't it a bug in CollectionViewGroup, that when adding an item, Multi Converter receives Items.Count = ItemCount - 1?</li></ul><p>Any advice would be highly appreciated!</p><p>The full sample code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/pavka1799/ObservableVsConverter.git\" target=_blank>GitHub</a>.</p><p>Some code excerpts are below -<br><strong>XAML</strong>:</p><pre>                &lt;DataGrid.GroupStyle&gt;\n                &lt;GroupStyle&gt;\n                    &lt;GroupStyle.ContainerStyle&gt;\n                        &lt;Style TargetType=&quot;{x:Type GroupItem}&quot;&gt;\n                            &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Margin&quot;

Still,  the situation with the Multi Converter receiving Items.Count = ItemCount - 1 seems to be incorrect...</p><p>Also, would appreciate an advice, how to make use of CollectionChanged in the &lt;GroupStyle&gt;, to ensure correct recalculation of subtotals on adding items in the existing groups.

Works great.  On my Poup is another UserControl that contains TextBoxes, ComboBoxes, Buttons, etc.\n\nWhen I show the Popup using, MyPopup.IsOpen = true; from the code behind of my application it is displayed as I would expect.\n\nWhile the Popup is open I navigate to any other application, use Windows Notepad as an example.  I start typing in Notepad and then return to my WPF application whose Popup is still being displayed.  This is the behavior I want to see.\n\nHere lies the problem.  If I click the TextBox on the Poup my application seems to **never be notified that the focus has been set on the TextBox.**  If I start typing after clicking on my Textbox the characters are added to the open Notepad application.  This behavior happens no matter which \"other\" application I open and/or select while my Popup is displayed.  The only way to overcome this problem is to close the Popup by clicking my close button on the Popup.  For whatever reason Buttons are not affected by this strange behavior.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 3/6/2020, 11:56 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

I found out, tis behaviour was already submitted to Microsoft Connect with FeedbackID=336325. But the site is closed.\n\nThe problem is, once DataContext is bound, adorner layer border is not changed even if error is revalidated. The last one can be easily debugged. Interestingly enough, similar behaviour is notified if control goes invisible - the red border is still visible.\n\nOn the other hand, if CellTemplate/DataTemplate/Binding is used instead of DisplayMemberBinding all works as expected. In my opinion this is some sort of bug.\n\nSo, a workaround is possible but, for my case, is hard to realize because there a lot of existing custom controls/views/etc. and a lot of not more maintenable templates where templated GridViewColumn's may not work at all - it canresults in month of work to manually refactor all that. And, Loaded-event is actually heavily in use due to some specific architecture - it is currently nearly impossible (by a working hours) to redevelop all this.\n\nI've also tried to use resource template and attached property - but don't sort it out how to define rebindable attached property.\n\nIn order to demonstrate what I mean, sample simple project, stripped down from a big project, is attached. Here is a list view within some columns binded to the same property. Columns 3 and 4 are not really working because of usage of attached property. Column 1 has a desired behaviour and used internal DataTemplate, column 2 uses DisplayMemberBinding and does not work as expected.\n\nSo, my question are:\n- would it be fixed soon ?\n- is some universal workaround here?\n\nMany thanks.\n\nAlexander Landa\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### blaha muha on 10/29/2019, 11:45 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/30/2019, 04:06 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

I've also checked the WritingCompleted event for errors, using the following code:\n\n```\nprivate void DocumentWriterOnWritingCompleted(object sender, WritingCompletedEventArgs e)\n{\n    if (e.Error != null)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error has occurred\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code does not catch anything on those machines in question.\n\nAdditional information - I've checked, and the document is NOT overwritten on the PCs where no error is detected, it simply fails to write the document silently. The WritingCompleted event is fired on all machines, but no errors on any.\n\nThe weirdest part is that this is the code I temporarily set up to create the `FixedDocument`:\n\n```\npublic FixedDocument DocumentGenerator()\n{\n    FixedDocument fixedDocument = new FixedDocument();\n\n    for (int numberOfPages = 0; numberOfPages < 50; numberOfPages++)\n    {\n        PageContent pageContent = new PageContent();\n\n        FixedPage fixedPage = new FixedPage()\n        {\n            Width = new Size(96 * 8.5, 96 * 11).Width,\n            Height = new Size(96 * 8.5, 96 * 11).Height\n        };\n\n        //Add a canvas with a TextBlock and a Rectangle as children.\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas();\n        fixedPage.Children.Add(canvas);\n        TextBlock textBlock = new TextBlock();\n        textBlock.Text =\n            string.Format(\"Page {0} / {1}\\n\\nThis Is Page {0}.\",\n                i + 1, 1000);\n        textBlock.FontSize = 24;\n        canvas.Children.Add(textBlock);\n        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();\n        rect.Width = 200;\n        rect.Height = 200;\n        rect.Fill =\n            new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(200, 20, 50, 200));\n        canvas.Children.Add(rect);\n        ((IAddChild)pageContent).AddChild(fixedPage);\n\n        fixedDocument.Pages.Add(pageContent);\n    }\n\n    return fixedDocument;\n}\n```\n\nWhen `numberOfPages` is ~> 30, no error is shown on the problem PC, but when the `numberOfPages` is ~< 20, an error IS shown on the problem PC. These boundaries change depending on what is being rendered on the page (so it appears to be dependent on size/complexity of document somehow).\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone's ever seen anything like this before? Why on earth would the content that is in the `FixedDocument` have any effect on whether an error is thrown due to attempting to overwrite a file that is locked by another program?\nI've tried updating to .NET Framework 4.8 - this does not fix the issue.\n\nAdditional info:\nOn my computer and the other PCs where an error successfully shows up when trying to overwrite a file, the error is the following:\n_-An object that does not derive from System.Exception has been wrapped in a RuntimeWrappedException._\nThe stacktrace is the following:\n\n```\n   at

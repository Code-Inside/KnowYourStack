These comments contain helpful instructions or information regarding the changes that are part of the commit. As happens with all commit message comments, they are removed by git and do not end up in the final commit message.\r\n\r\nHowever, the file that is passed to the `commit-msg` to be validated still contains these comments. This may affect the outcome of the commit message validation. In such cases, the author will not realize that the commit message is not in the desired format until the linting checks fail on CI (which validates the final commit messages and is not affected by this issue), usually several minutes later.\r\n\r\nPossible ways in which the commit message validation outcome can be affected:\r\n- The minimum body length check may pass incorrectly, even if there is no actual body, because the comments are counted as part of the body.\r\n- The maximum line length check may fail incorrectly due to a very long line in the comments.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the problem by removing comment lines before validating a commit message that comes from a file.\r\n\r\nFixes #37865.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38169","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(dev-infra): ignore comments when validating commit messages\" (#38169)"},{"Id":"663363765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T23:11:31","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"38168","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(dev-infra): update commit body checks","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the commit body checking logic:\r\n* avoid checking the length of lines in commit body\r\n* ignores lines that start with `#` char, since these lines are skipped by git\r\n* adds `release` into the `minBodyLengthTypeExcludes` list in a config rather than having a hard-coded exclusion for this commit type in the code\r\n\r\nResolves #37865.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38168","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(dev-infra): update commit body checks\" (#38168)"},{"Id":"663360912","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T23:02:39","Actor":"rockument69","Number":"38167","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Refactor frequent-ngmodules.md to make it easier to understand","State":"open","Body":"Project DOCS-735 to rewrite headings to focus on user tasks,\r\nverify that the content is up-to-date and complete, and\r\nadd relevant links to other NgModule topics to improve readability.\r\nAlso addresses one of many issues in GitHub issue 21531.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

As far as I understand, the suggested replacement is to run `ng serve` with the desired locale every time.\r\n\r\nA little bit background here. We have 2 applications, every with 4 languages. For production, we build it with AOT as suggested. For development we use JIT and load corresponding translation depending on the browser URL (German for `/de/` for example), this mimics prod behavior. So, to switch translation and check how the interface looks in a different language, you just need to pick up another item in the language menu. The page reloads at the same URL but with a different language. Starting from v9 it's not supported, so we would have to run `ng serve` every time for a new language and start from the home page for every language again.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a suggested way repeat v8 behavior? I checked `loadTranslatios` but it accepts a key-value object, not a XLIFF data. Is any function that can transform from XLIFF to a format understandable for `loadTranslations`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI:

The Angular compiler generates factory objects which are exported but typically not used, as they are only needed for compatibility with View Engine. This results in top-level constructor calls, such as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const FooNgFactory = new NgModuleFactory(Foo);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`NgModuleFactory` has a side-effecting constructor, so this statement cannot be tree shaken, even if `FooNgFactory` is never imported. The `NgModuleFactory` continues to reference its associated `NgModule` and prevents the module and all its unused dependencies from being tree shaken. This effectively prevents all components from being tree shaken, making Closure builds significantly larger than they should be.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to wrap `NgModuleFactory` constructor with `noSideEffects(() => /* ... */)`, which tricks the Closure compiler into assuming that the invoked function has no side effects. This allows it to tree-shake unused `NgModuleFactory()` constructors when they aren't imported. Since the factory can be removed, the module can also be removed (if nothing else references it), thus tree shaking unused components as expected.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Building separately with Webpack in Production mode works as expected.\r\n\r\nI investigated the problem a bit and now I'd say that it's because of \"sideEffects: false\" in their package.json. If I understand correctly side effects and \"pure\" modules are different things, or? Anyway, build optimizer's webpack loader marks some code as PURE when it isn't.\r\n\r\nAt first I've [created issue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3708) in Swiper's repo but maintainer says that Webpack's tree shaking works as expected.

I have a specific use case with a drop list + boundary element, where I **always** want the drag items to be rendered under certain surrounding elements. When the drop list is sitting statically, it looks fine. But when I start dragging, the preview is rendered above everything else - which is okay for a lot of drag and drop scenarios but not mine.\r\n\r\nConsider drop shadow CSS styling. The drop shadow can visually extend beyond the drag boundary, while the element itself is still contained inside the drag boundary. As stated above, when the list and drag items are sitting statically, the drop shadow extending beyond the drag boundary is being hidden by the ordering/z-index/styling of other elements (which is what I want). The moment the preview element (w/ drop shadow applied) becomes active, it's drop shadow is completely visible and extending outside of the drag boundary and there is nothing I can do about it because the preview element is in a completely different DOM location (bottom of document body, on top of everything) nowhere near the drop list and it's neighboring elements.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anymore info.\r\n\r\nAlso, a public `dragRef.getPlaceholderElement()` method exists. Can a public `dragRef.getPreviewElement()` method also be added to allow accessing the preview element during hooks/events?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(drag-drop): Custom drag preview insertion location\" (#20055)"},{"Id":"663110298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T15:33:18","Actor":"lukejack","Number":"20056","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DragDrop): cdkDropListDropped fires from source rather than destination","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mvaic6\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This works, but the implementation still bugs me because the template is being stamped out in the view container, modifying the DOM, and then the drag preview element is immediately moved to bottom of the document body, modifying the DOM **again** (versus the other solution that only modifies the DOM once). Same idea for the placeholder template as well, how it is placed into the DOM and then immediately moved around (using `replaceChild`)...when it could just be put in the correct place from the start.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto made the following comment:\r\n>The idea behind inserting the view through the ViewContainerRef is to ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item. I agree that ideally we'd just create the element outside the DOM, but an alternate solution is to measure the element before the preview has been created.\r\n\r\nbut I am struggling to understand this comment (_\"ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item\"_). As far as I am aware, an injector cannot be specified when using `createEmbeddedView` and the injector used inside the preview template is simply the injector of the component in which the template is **defined**.\r\n\r\nIssue about this (still open...) from 3 years ago:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14935\r\n\r\nSo what would stamping a template out using \r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate, previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nhave anything to do with dependency injection?

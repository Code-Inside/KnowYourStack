In a real MPA app where it performs a full page reload browsers show a native loading indicator. This has been impossible to implement until now with SPA because there was no way to show browser's native loading indicator. But now there is a new browser api called the Navigation API, specifically designed for SPA apps that finally shows a native browser loader when navigating in SPA app. 🎉\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nImplement the new Navigation API. Yes, it is a new and bleeding edge feature but for those users with browsers that already support it (like Chrome) I think it adds a really nice UX touch.\r\n\r\n[developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/navigation-api](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/navigation-api/)\r\n[developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API)\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nhttps://gigantic-honored-octagon.glitch.me/\r\n\r\n_(In the demo, you can activate the `Add an artificial two-second delay to all navigations (should impact the loading spinner/scroll restoration/focus reset/accessibility announcements).` checkbox to see the native loader appearing on the tab when navigating)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/assets/34019878/e184690f-e448-4393-9695-3a73692ff12f)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNone because this is a new API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53321","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(router): Support the new Navigation API\" (#53321)"},{"Id":"2021942725","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-02T08:26:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"53319","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): avoid conflicts with built-in global variables in for loop blocks","State":"open","Body":"Currently we generate the following TCB for a `@for` loop:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// @for (item of items; track item) {...}\r\nfor (const item of this.items) {\r\n  var _t1 = item;\r\n  // Do things with `_t1`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is problematic if the item name is the same as a global variable (e.g. `document`), because when the TCB has references to that variable (e.g. `document.createElement`), it'll find the loop initializer instead of the global variable.\r\n\r\nThese changes fix the issue by generating the following instead:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfor (const _t1 of this.items) {\r\n  // Do things with `_t1`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #53293.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53319","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): avoid conflicts with built-in global variables in for loop blocks\" (#53319)"},{"Id":"2021672913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-02T00:31:09","Actor":"Eric1243123","Number":"53316","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular compatibility with node v20.10","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nRecently, node updated to v20.10: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.10.0\r\n\r\nI was curious as to if and what versions of Angular it is compatible with.

However, the content of `'./src/main.server'` is not being updated, and neither is another file being created with the expected content. \r\n\r\nIf you create a new application using the Angular CLI v17 with the option to use ssr, then a `'./src/main.server'` will be created with a default export of a bootstrap function. \r\n\r\nYou can review the same error being reported in this issue angular/angular#52998, however, in the issue is not mentioned that the default project created with Angular CLI v17 does created the expected file. \r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nUsing CLI\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx -p @angular/cli@16 ng new angular-ssr-migrated\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nnpx ng add @nguniversal/express-engine\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ngit commit -m \"chore: add nguniversal\"\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nnpx ng update @angular/core@17 @angular/cli@17\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.5\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nI guess the correct content of the `'./src/main.server'` file should be: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { AppServerModule } from './app/app.server.module';\r\n\r\nexport default AppServerModule;\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering this don't want to do too many updates to the code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26568","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The main.server file is not being updated with the Angular 17 schematic update\" (#26568)"},{"Id":"2022771813","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-03T22:03:36","Actor":"nicolae536","Number":"26567","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typescript path alias not working when using the new @angular-devkit/build-angular:application","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn webpack build we could define path aliases for certain folders and imports things using an index.ts file in the root of the folder.

From https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exactOptionalPropertyTypes\r\n\r\nWith `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` enabled, TypeScript applies stricter rules around how it handles properties on type or interfaces which have a `?` prefix.\r\n\r\nFor example, this interface declares that there is a property which can be one of two strings: ‘dark’ or ‘light’ or it should not be in the object.\r\n```ts\r\ninterface UserDefaults {\r\n  // The absence of a value represents 'system'\r\n  colorThemeOverride?: \"dark\" | \"light\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this flag enabled, there are three values which you can set `colorThemeOverride` to be: “dark”, “light” and undefined.\r\n\r\nSetting the value to undefined will allow most JavaScript runtime checks for the existence to fail, which is effectively falsy. However, this isn’t quite accurate; `colorThemeOverride: undefined` is not the same as `colorThemeOverride` not being defined. For example, \"colorThemeOverride\" in settings would have different behavior with undefined as the key compared to not being defined.\r\n\r\n`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` makes TypeScript truly enforce the definition provided as an optional property.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst settings = getUserSettings();\r\nsettings.colorThemeOverride = \"dark\";\r\nsettings.colorThemeOverride = \"light\";\r\n\r\n// But not:\r\nsettings.colorThemeOverride = undefined;\r\n// Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type '\"dark\" | \"light\"' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the type of the target.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26547","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): enable TypeScript `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` in new strict workspaces\" (#26547)"},{"Id":"2021503654","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T19:58:03","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26556","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): normalize asset source locations in Vite-based development server","State":"open","Body":"The Vite-based development server uses an allow list to permit access to configured assets.

Is there a parameter to configure the GLOBAL heap used by NodeJS process for building phase ? If not, I think it could be useful to have one, and/or be able to fine-tune memory for all V8 isolates with high memory consumption\r\n\r\n* I cannot find any documentation explaning the fact that \"production > optimization > scripts\" option can result in high memory consumption, why it takes such memory, how I could tune it. Is is possible to have such a documentation / explanation ?\r\n\r\n* I also found this issue about memory limits for several \"V8 isolates\" in NodeJS, and was wondering whether it could be linked to my issue : [worker: resourceLimits overridden by --max-old-space-size](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43991)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCommand run

However, if I hover over any element with MatTooltip, then focus back on the number input field, the scrolling behavior unexpectedly changes. Instead of scrolling the page, it increments or decrements the number in the input. This issue can also occur on the Angular Material official [website](https://v11.material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 15 08 30](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/89395304/eef26764-cf11-4f7c-b5bb-a819239abcd6)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/angular/porobbapdry?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftooltip-delay-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to a page with a <input type='number'> with matInput.\r\n2. Hover over an element with MatTooltip.\r\n3. Focus on the number input field.\r\n4. Try scrolling over the number input field.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected and consistent user experience is that scrolling over a number input field should scroll the page, not change the input's value. This unexpected behavior disrupts the user experience, especially in forms with tooltips and number inputs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a <input type='number'> field with matInput is focused, and the user scrolls with the mouse wheel, the default behavior is for the page itself to scroll, not the number in the input field. However, this behavior changes after interacting with an element that has MatTooltip. Specifically, after hovering over a MatTooltip element and then focusing on the number input field, scrolling with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page. Instead, it changes the value in the number input field, incrementing or decrementing it.

Some factors to consider when choosing whether to indicate selection with aria-selected or aria-checked are:\r\nSome design systems use aria-selected for single-select widgets and aria-checked for multi-select widgets.

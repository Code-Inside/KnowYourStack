There are more details in the individual commits.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement two-way property instruction\r\nReworks the compiler so that it generates a `twoWayProperty` instruction, instead of `property`, for the property side of a two-way binding. Currently the new instruction passes through to `property`, but it'll have some two-way-binding-specific logic in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): update access of members in expression parser\r\nCurrently all the members of `_ParseAST` are public, even though they're all used only within the class. This change marks them as private so that it's explicit which ones are intended to be used outside the class.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): introduce two-way listener instructions\r\nAdds the following new instructions:\r\n* `twoWayBindingSet` - used to assign values inside of the listener side of a two-way binding. Currently a noop, but will come into play later.\r\n* `twoWayListener` - used to bind a two-way listener. Currently calls directly into `listener`, but it may be useful in the future.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): preserve expression in two-way listeners\r\nCurrently the listener side two-way listeners are parsed by appending `=$event` to the raw expression. This is problematic, because:\r\n1. It can interfere with other expressions (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37809).\r\n2. It can lead to confusing error messages because users will see code that they didn't write.\r\n3. It doesn't allow us to further manipulate the expression.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove the logic that appends `=$event` to resolve the issue. There's also some new logic that checks the expression after it has been parsed to ensure that the result is an assignable expression.\r\n\r\nSubsequent commits will update the code that emits the expression to add back the `$event` assignment where it's needed.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): update two-way listener emit in definition builder\r\nUpdates the template definition builder to emit the new format for the listener side of two-way bindings.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement new two-way listener shape in pipeline\r\nImplements the new shape of two-way listener instructions in the template pipeline.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): allow some invalid expressions in two-way bindings that previously worked by accident\r\nIn one of the earlier commits, the logic that appends `=$event` before parsing two-way bindings was removed and some validation was added to prevent unassignable expressions from being used. This ended up being problematic, because previously the parser was incorrectly allowing some invalid expressions which users came to depend on. For example, it transformed `[(value)]=\"a && a.b\"` to `a && (a.b = $event)`.\r\n\r\nThese changes add some special cases for the common breakages that came up during the TGP.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54154","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update shape of two-way binding instructions\"

Our software have a currently productive version which is running Angular 15 (I'll refer to this branch as \"support\" from now). Our next version, planned to be released around april, is upgraded to Angular 16, and this branch build (called \"dev\" branch) is running fine as of now.\r\n\r\nOur support branch did not have any commits since a week so I can exclude a code change being the source of the break. Last week our nightly builds were completely fine.

The builder will automatically detect and use specific postcss configuration files if present in either the project root directory or the workspace root. Files present in the project root will have priority over a workspace root file. If using a custom postcss configuration file, the automatic tailwind integration will be disabled. To use both a custom postcss configuration and tailwind, the tailwind setup must be included in the custom postcss configuration file.\r\n\r\nThe configuration files must be JSON and named one of the following:\r\n* `postcss.config.json`\r\n* `.postcssrc.json`\r\n\r\nA configuration file can use either an array form or an object form to setup plugins. An example of the array form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"tailwindcss\",\r\n        [\"rtlcss\", { \"useCalc\": true }]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same in an object form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": {\r\n        \"tailwindcss\": {},\r\n        \"rtlcss\": { \"useCalc\": true }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using a custom postcss configuration may result in reduced build and rebuild\r\nperformance. Postcss will be used to process all global and component stylesheets\r\nwhen a custom configuration is present.

Import and use the linked library in the `app.component.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nimport { MyLibComponent } from 'my-lib';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [RouterOutlet],\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrl: './app.component.css'\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  title = 'my-app';\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log(MyLibComponent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run `ng serve` - The component class is printed in the browser console.\r\n4. Change something in the linked library component `MyLibComponent` and rebuild it with `ng build my-lib --watch` - The change is not applied to the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.12...v0.20.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.19.0` or `~0.19.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\nThis time there is only one breaking change, and it only matters for people using Deno. Deno tests that use esbuild will now fail unless you make the change described below.\n\n-   Work around API deprecations in Deno 1.40.x ([#&#8203;3609](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3609), [#&#8203;3611](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3611))\n\n    [Deno 1.40.0](https://deno.com/blog/v1.40) was just released and introduced run-time warnings about certain APIs that esbuild uses. With this release, esbuild will work around these run-time warnings by using newer APIs if they are present and falling back to the original APIs otherwise. This should avoid the warnings without breaking compatibility with older versions of Deno.\n\n    Unfortunately, doing this introduces a breaking change. The newer child process APIs lack a way to synchronously terminate esbuild's child process, so calling `esbuild.stop()` from within a Deno test is no longer sufficient to prevent Deno from failing a test that uses esbuild's API (Deno fails tests that create a child process without killing it before the test ends). To work around this, esbuild's `stop()` function has been changed to return a promise, and you now have to change `esbuild.stop()` to `await esbuild.stop()` in all of your Deno tests.\n\n-   Reorder implicit file extensions within `node_modules` ([#&#8203;3341](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3341), [#&#8203;3608](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3608))\n\n    In [version 0.18.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.18.0), esbuild changed the behavior of implicit file extensions within `node_modules` directories (i.e. in published packages) to prefer `.js` over `.ts` even when the `--resolve-extensions=` order prefers `.ts` over `.js` (which it does by default). However, doing that also accidentally made esbuild prefer `.css` over `.ts`, which caused problems for people that published packages containing both TypeScript and CSS in files with the same name.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will reorder TypeScript file extensions immediately after the last JavaScript file extensions in the implicit file extension order instead of putting them at the end of the order. Specifically the default implicit file extension order is `.tsx,.ts,.jsx,.js,.css,.json` which used to become `.jsx,.js,.css,.json,.tsx,.ts` in `node_modules` directories. With this release it will now become `.jsx,.js,.tsx,.ts,.css,.json` instead.\n\n    Why even rewrite the implicit file extension order at all? One reason is because the `.js` file is more likely to behave correctly than the `.ts` file. The behavior of the `.ts` file  may depend on `tsconfig.json` and the `tsconfig.json` file may not even be published, or may use `extends` to refer to a base `tsconfig.json` file that wasn't published. People can get into this situation when they forget to add all `.ts` files to their `.npmignore` file before publishing to npm. Picking `.js` over `.ts` helps make it more likely that resulting bundle will behave correctly.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>typicode/husky (husky)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.0.7`](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/releases/tag/v9.0.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/compare/v9.0.6...v9.0.7)\n\n-   fix: typo and source `~/.huskyrc` correctly (compatibility with v8)\n-   docs: fix example by [@&#8203;typicode](https://togithub.com/typicode) in [https://github.com/typicode/husky/pull/1363](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/pull/1363)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.13`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.5.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   build(deps-dev): bump jsdom from 23.2.0 to 24.0.0 by [@&#8203;dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632)\n-   feat: Implement EventSource by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608)\n-   fix: readable body by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, the contents of `projects/foo-library/src/public-api.ts` look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n * Public API Surface of foo-library\r\n */\r\n\r\nexport * from './lib/foo-library.service';\r\nexport * from './lib/foo-library.component'; // uses .component instead of .cmp\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.1\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.6\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.1\r\nng-packagr                      17.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26981","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"new library public-api.ts file not using component type declared on angular.json's schematics\" (#26981)"},{"Id":"2102589108","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T17:35:08","Actor":"msx15615634157","Number":"26976","RawContent":null,"Title":"after upgrade 17, my dynamic import all cant not work.

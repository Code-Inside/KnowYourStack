'visible' : 'hidden'\" \r\n            (click)=\"addToCart(product, 1)\">Add to cart</button>\r\n\r\nThe animation is very simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const visibilityAnimation = trigger('visibilityAnimation', \r\n[\r\n  state('hidden', style({ opacity: 0 })),\r\n  state('visible', style({ opacity: 1 })),\r\n\r\n  // fade in\r\n  transition('hidden => visible', [animate('1s')]),\r\n\r\n  // fade out \r\n  transition('visible => hidden', [animate('.5s')]),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo clearly the animation state can only ever be `'visible'` or `'hidden`' and one of the defined transitions should always work.\r\n\r\nIndeed, before the list has been sorted, when adding an item, the `visible => hidden` transition is triggered as expected every time. \r\n\r\nAfter sorting the list - the `visible => hidden` or `hidden => visible` transitions aren't triggered on the next click (the button doesn't fade). However it isn't completely broken - once you click again it will work. \r\n\r\nIt is as if the state of each animation is reset to a 'null' or 'void' state. In fact if you change the transitions to be `* => hidden` and `* => visible` then the animation always works. (This is unacceptable in reality since I don't want the animation to run when the page is loaded).\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to fix this by making the list items separate components, but that doesn't work well for my actual situation.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, any similar existing issues I was able to find are related to the *ngIf (:enter / :leave) animation mechanism which does not apply here.

This may not be the case when:\r\n\r\n- the input signal is only ever changing using `bindToValue`. e.g. when Zone components bind to the signal input.\r\n\r\n- the input signal is initialized with an initial value, and read before the computation is set. This should never happen in practice because we are guarding by `initialized()` but it highlights the issue that `switchedComputation` needs a way to be notified of change.\r\n\r\nEven if we set `stale=true`, it doesn't guarantee that `switchedComputation` is re-evaluated because\r\nthe reactive graph will actually poll all consumed producers and realize that nothing changes because\r\ne.g. we always deal with static values.\r\n\r\nWe fix this for now (needs more optimization/performance insights) by adding an producer that we can\r\nuse to notify the computation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50837","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: fix input signal not allowing new values\" (#50837)"},{"Id":"1772073737","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-23T20:07:42","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"50838","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade guide is missing ng command","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe upgrade guide (upgrade.angular.io) is missing the `ng` commands when upgrading from Angular 15 to 16.

Make sure you have both `node` and `yarn` installed.\r\n   We recommend using `nvm` to manage your node versions.\r\n2. angular/components uses Bazel which requires certain Bash and UNIX tools.\r\n   - On Windows: Follow the [instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html#installing-compilers-and-language-runtimes)\r\n   to install [`MSYS2`](https://www.msys2.org/) and the listed \"Common MSYS2 packages\".\r\n   Afterwards add `C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.\r\n3. Fork the `angular/components` repo on GitHub.\r\n4. Clone your fork to your machine with `git clone`.\r\n   Recommendation: name your git remotes `upstream` for `angular/components`\r\n   and `<your-username>` for your fork. Also see the [team git shortcuts](https://github.com/angular/components/wiki/Team-git----bash-shortcuts).\r\n5. From the root of the project, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo build angular/components in release mode, run `yarn build`. The output can be found under `dist/releases`.\r\n\r\nTo bring up a local server, run `yarn dev-app`. This will automatically watch for changes\r\nand rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI deleted %userprofile%/_bazel_%username%, but I have the same error.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ndev-app launch successful\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI have the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[0 / 1] [Prepa] BazelWorkspaceStatusAction stable-status.txt\r\nERROR: H:/projets/github/angular/components/tools/angular/BUILD.bazel:14:30: Bundling Javascript ../npm/node_modules/@angular/router/fesm2022/router.mjs [esbuild] failed: (Exit 127): _router_linked_bundle_esbuild_launcher.bat failed: error executing command bazel-out\\x64_windows-opt-exec-2B5CBBC6\\bin\\tools\\angular\\_router_linked_bundle_esbuild_launcher.bat --esbuild_args=bazel-out/x64_windows-fastbuild/bin/tools/angular/router_linked_bundle.args.json ...

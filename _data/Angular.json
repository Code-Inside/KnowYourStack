If you change the name to 'isDefault' this error does not show up. So, this error \"':' expected.\" is preventing me from creating a model with a property named default. You are allowed to declare a model with property named 'default', no errors involved. But as soon as you try to use that property in a function it provides an error. If this is intended behavior then why would the compiler allow a model with a property named 'default'?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-3mcvxr?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n':' expected.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.1\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout              8.0.0-beta.26\r\n@angular/material                 8.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.1\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35023","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Compiler not allowing property named 'default'\" (#35023)"},{"Id":"556569031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-29T00:28:36","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"35022","RawContent":null,"Title":"Styling cleanup","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Perhaps there's a justification for why the `ActivatedRoute` behaves the way it does now, but in its present state it seems very counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe `ActivatedRoute` snapshot during `ngOnInit` does not contain query string params that are in the URL. I find this very counter-intuitive, given that they _are_ available at that time.\r\n\r\nThe issue I have is that I have some logic that might do route redirecting based on app or local/session storage state, and it might fire before the qs param check. I actually need to know when my component loads if I have a certain qs param or not so I can redirect based on that param. The issue is that I want this to occur _before_ any application logic fires which is not going to happen since the only way to get it is to subscribe to the `ActivatedRoute`. QS params fire after the ngOnInit function completes.\r\n\r\nIs there a justification for why QS params are not part of the route snapshot? Given that qs params are part of the URL used to get to the current view, I find it (as do many people on Stack Overflow as evidenced by the number of tickets on this topic) counter-intuitive and ergonomically ugly. Having to subscribe async (and therefore out of order for what I need) causes dirty code vs something that I actually need to be sync. I know I can do something like wrap a timeout, but if the QS param isn't set, then I have this observable hanging out and never completing unless I wire up a timeout or something else for the activated route subscription. Overall, I find it confusing, counter-intuitive, and a source of ugly code.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd the query string params to the `ActivatedRoute.snapshot` _before_ `OnInit` is called, as one might expect them to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nMy current alternative is to subscribe to the `ActivatedRoute`, and `take(2)` (since the first emission is always an empty object), and then take the 2nd emission. There are two problems in my use case for this:\r\n\r\n1) I need this to be synchronous because it creates a race condition with my other `ngOnInit` bootstrap code and there is a chance that another redirect that _shouldn't_ happen could happen first given my app state.\r\n2) If there are no qs params, `ActivatedRoute` subscription doesn't terminate, which will force me to write an additional arbitrary timeout just to get rid of it, or leave it un-terminated. This is not ideal.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35018","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make Query String Params Available in ngOnInit ActivatedRoute snapshot\" (#35018)"},{"Id":"556504704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T22:13:02","Actor":"mbrierst","Number":"35016","RawContent":null,"Title":"Going back/forward multiple steps doesn't reload components sometimes","State":"open","Body":"1.

Puppeteer can now talk to a real, unpatched Firefox binary (as opposed to the old [Juggler](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/juggler)-based approach).

Yes, the pipeline to build/deploy was working in Angular 8.2, the behaviour changed migrating to Angular 9.rc10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe way that angular.json configuration for \"fileReplacements\" and \"assets\" works has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo deploy with CloudFoundry I need to provide an environment specific manifest.yml file.\r\nSo I have a manifest.{env}.yml for each environment.\r\n\r\nIn 8.2, I was specifying to replace the manifest file with \"fileReplacements\", and then adding the manifest.yml as an \"asset\" to push to CloudFoundry.\r\n\r\nFor example for the environment \"staging\" I would have:\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.staging.yml\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe first step here would be fileReplacements kicking in, moving the content from manifest.staging.yml inside manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe second/last step is manifest.yml being included in dist through the \"assets\" configuration, but with the staging's configuration inside.\r\n\r\nInstead, after migrating to Angular 9.rc10, fileReplacements doesn't happen in time and manifest.yml has the content of the original (non-staging) one.\r\n\r\nAs a possible fix I tried this approach:\r\nI tried to change my assets configuration to grab directly the manifest file:\r\n{\r\n\t\"glob\":   \"manifest.staging.yml\",\r\n\t\"input\":  \"apps/appointment-manager/src/deployment\",\r\n\t\"output\": \"manifest.yml\"\r\n},\r\n\r\nI expected:\r\ndist/manifest.yml\r\nInstead I got:\r\ndist/manifest.yml/manifest.staging.yml\r\n\r\nthe output was read as a directory where to place the content.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.10\r\nNode:

function `async` will not make it wait for the asynchronous call to `compileComponents()`.\r\n\r\nThe code should be changed to this (added `await`):\r\n```JavaScript\r\n  beforeEach(async(() => {\r\n    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ MyComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n    .compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource code:

When I navigate away from the search result route from the first result page and come back to it, everything works fine. When I navigate away from another page (index > 0) and come back to it, an `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` error is raised.\r\n\r\nReproduction link : https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-okcqx3\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Clic on \"item11\" or \"item22\" link, then \"back to table\". No error is raised\r\n2. Navigate to page 2 or 3 and clic any link (\"item33\" for instance), then \"back to table\". Error is raised.\r\n\r\nDetailed messages (two different errors are raised) : \r\n\r\n- `Previous value: 'disabled: true'. Current value: 'disabled: false'`\r\n- `Previous value: 'null: undefined'.

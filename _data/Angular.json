That is clear.\n\nBut what I need is an input that can be set programmatically and has a transform function.\n\nExample:\n```ts\nfunction limit(value: number) {\n  return Math.min(Math.max(value, 0), 3);\n}\n\n...\n\nprecision = input<numer>(1, { transform: limit } );  // setting the precision gets always limited\n\nresetPrecision() {\n   this.precision(1);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe above could be solved in at least two ways:\n1) using some computed or linkedSignal:\n\nBut then I would have 2 precission signal members holding \"slightly\" different data --> \nThat's _error prone_ (i.e.: using the wrong signal in the template )\n\n2) using a setter with <span>@</span>Input()\nIn this case you could use a WriteableSignal and do the transformation in the setter.\n- Slightly better in that you hold the data only once, but you can write the signal from within the component without applying the transform (still error prone)\n- Will the setter variant be supported in signal components ?\n\nSo you see the problem.\n`model` has no transform, and `input` is not writeable\n\n\n\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60845","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"input signals are not writeable and model signals do not support transformation\" (#60845)"},{"Id":"2988508584","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-11T12:18:36","Actor":"ddsharpdev","Number":"60844","RawContent":null,"Title":"First Tutorial with editor does not work","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nSeems like WebContainers don't have all necessary files to compile\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23526f90-fe93-4705-b687-0b699cd72175)\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"./app/app.component\"\n\n    src/main.ts:10:29:\n      10 │ import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';\n         ╵                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n✘ [ERROR] TS2307: Cannot find module './app/app.component' or its corresponding type declarations.

Apparently, the generated Javacript code tries to access the environment before it has been defined.\n\nThis does not happen for all such cases: only apparently when a component imported from the environment itself tries to import another component from the environment.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-g8kmhvqk?file=src%2Fmain.ts for a complete minimal reproduction.\n\nThe code compiles fine, but at runtime we immediately get the following error:\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'childComponent')\n    at children.component.ts:6:25\n    at children.component.ts:6:40\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.7\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.7\n@angular/build               19.2.7\n@angular/cli                 19.2.7\n@schematics/angular          19.2.7\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nRunning `ng serve --configuration production` works fine.\nA workaround consists in replacing\n\n```ts\nimports: [environment.childComponent]\n```\n\nby\n\n```\nimports: [forwardRef(() => environment.childComponent)]\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30091","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"environment is undefined since CLI 19.2.7\" (#30091)"},{"Id":"2987556318","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-11T18:05:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30090","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update devinfra digest to 75b0023","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `77fb8b4` -> `75b0023` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Bazelisk from being used as a Go dependency via gazelle's `go_deps` extension ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649)).\n-   Improved signal handling ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657), [https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658)).\n-   Improved documentation on how to install Bazelisk on Windows ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668)).\n-   Restored debugging symbols in Windows binaries ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669)).\n-   Improved `--migrate` mode

automatic change detection or manual calls to `ApplicationRef.tick`.\n    Prior to this change, animations would not be flushed in some situations\n    if change detection did not run on any views

However, there are a few points that could enhance clarity and accessibility:\n\n1. Missing Links in Package Table\nThe package overview table lists several Angular component packages like @angular/cdk, @angular/material, @angular/google-maps, and @angular/youtube-player, but the \"Docs\" column mentions \"Docs\" without providing clickable links to the respective documentation pages. Adding direct URLs would improve usability for developers trying to access documentation quickly.\n\n2. Quick Links Section Improvement\nThe Quick Links section mentions helpful resources like:\n\nDocumentation\n\nDemos and Guides\n\nFAQs\n\nContributing\n\nStackBlitz Template\n\nIt would be more developer-friendly if these were formatted as actual links instead of plain text mentions.\n\n3. Clarification on Browser & Screen Reader Support\nThe current section on supported browsers and screen readers is comprehensive. However, it might help to add a last verified version or date for transparency on how recently these compatibility checks were validated.\n\nSuggested Actions:\nUpdate the documentation table with working links to each package’s docs.\n\nConvert the Quick Links into a bulleted list with actual hyperlinks.\n\nAdd timestamps/version notes on browser and screen reader support.\n\nThis would help improve the onboarding experience for new users and make the documentation more navigable.\n\nThanks for the amazing work on Angular Components!\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nreadme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30846","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE Suggestion to Improve Documentation Navigation and Component Package Overview\" (#30846)"},{"Id":"2984263258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-10T17:11:58","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30839","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move density tokens to their token files","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the `src/material/core/tokens/_density.scss` file that hosted all component density tokens.

One requirement I got was to have the mobile design trigger whenever the Small breakpoint is triggered (not just at XSmall). However, when using the fixedTopGap like in the example given in the docs ([via Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Fsidenav-responsive-example.ts)), I found out that the Toolbar switches its height from 64px to 56px when on XSmall.\n\nI'd like to add to the docs of the Toolbar at least some mention of the height-changing behavior. From what I can see, only the Toolbar (of all Angular Material components) has a behavior like this and is thus very different from what I was used to. The only mention of a separate mobile height is in the Styling part of the docs and it only mentions there is a value with that name and how to override it.\n\nAdditionally, I'd add something like the following to the docs of fixedTopGap in Sidenav: \n\"When used with Material Toolbar, the value set here should take into consideration the standard-height and mobile-height difference and when it's applied.\"\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Toolbar doesn't mention responsiveness or how it works with Sidenav\" (#30829)"},{"Id":"2981100243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T22:48:25","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"30828","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30828","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied\" (#30828)"},{"Id":"2980820122","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T20:00:48","Actor":"nwilson-newcura","Number":"30827","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Material Migration m2-theming-v18): Material 18 Migration Fails - Invalid regular expression","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3.10\n\n### Description\n\nWhen attempting to run the `ng update @angular/material@18` script to make the step from Angular Material 17 to 18, the script breaks consistently, providing the following output:\n```\n$ ng update @angular/material@18.0\nUsing package manager: npm\nCollecting installed dependencies...\nFound 80 dependencies.\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cdk @ \"18.0.6\" (was \"17.3.10\")...\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/material @ \"18.0.6\" (was \"17.3.10\")...\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/material-moment-adapter @ \"18.0.6\" (was \"17.3.10\")...\nUPDATE package.json (3953 bytes)\n✔ Cleaning node modules directory\n✔ Installing packages\n** Executing migrations of package '@angular/cdk' **\n\n❯ Updates the Angular CDK to v18.\n    Skipping migration for project ems-ui-e2e.

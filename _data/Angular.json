-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: latest 13\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe just ported our project to Angular 14, and suddenly started getting this error:\r\n\r\n> the script element has a malformed attribute in its integrity attribute: \"undefined\"\r\n\r\nwe tracked it down to a module being lazily loaded. Looking around, we found that its entry being missing from the `sriHashes` object in `runtime.js`.\r\n\r\nSince:\r\n- there is only one chunk missing in the object, and it's the one with `id` `0`,  and\r\n-  adding `\"namedChunks\": true,` to the build configuration seems to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nit is for me very tempting to think that it is excluded from the dict because it's falsy. But I'm far from being able to check this.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nruntime.aee066f47596daf1.js:1 Error parsing 'integrity' attribute ('undefined').

An Existing Project, It Assumes The Code Is In a Directory Named src","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nFirst of all, my apologies if I'm not creating this bug in the correct place. I wasn't sure if this was an issue with Angular or @angular-eslint.\r\n\r\nI recently migrated a legacy app originally created manually with Angular 2 (not generated by the CLI) to an Angular CLI app using Angular 13. After this work was done, I added the linter by running _ng lint_. The CLI prompted me about adding the required libraries, etc, to enable the linter, and I accepted. Everything seemed to install correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, afterward, when trying to run the linter, I got an error saying that the setup was incorrect (original error message has been lost). I found the cause was that, in angular.json, the linter was configured to use the _src_ folder (as Angular apps do) as the location of the code (_lint->options->lintFilePatterns_ value). However, in the crazy old app I'd updated, the location of the source code was not under a folder named _src_.\r\n\r\nI understand this is probably a rare edge case, and I regret not naming that source folder _src_ to be consistent (hindsight!). If it would be possible for the process that sets up the linter to use the _sourceRoot_ value in _angular.json_ to determine the correct folder that might be helpful. This is a _minor_ issue. Thank you for all the hard work you've done with Angular!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.1\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

The container spans the full width of the view and the button it positioned to the top right of the container. I would like to position the overlay so that it is under the button but connected to the container. When I click the button, I expect the overlay to be positioned correctly within the view.\r\n\r\nFrom my initial investigation, the issue seems to be related to the `max-width` and `max-height` CSS attributes provided by the `.cdk-overlay-pane` https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2f9a59a24c0464cbed7f54cbeb5cba73e6007715/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L62-L63\r\n\r\nIn my stackblitz sample, I copied over these attributes into the [`styles.css` file](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/styles.css) (line 56-57). If those lines are commented out/removed, the overlay will work as intended. It appears that when attempting to calculate whether or not the overlay will be within the view, the min-width and min-height will affect the calculation. Also good to note that if the overlay is connected to the button instead of the container, the overlay will also work as inteded. However, for my specific use case, that is not possible due to other technical limitations.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that, regardless of which element the overlay is connected it, it will be positioned correctly within the view.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to position the overlay, the overlay will be pushed outside of the view\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 12.2.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.11\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25059","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): Overlay out of viewport bounds\" (#25059)"},{"Id":"1267999450","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T21:07:55","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25057","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25057","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25057)"},{"Id":"1267965435","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T20:14:23","Actor":"atrawally","Number":"25056","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level","State":"closed","Body":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in the Topography Guide where a function was incorrectly named.

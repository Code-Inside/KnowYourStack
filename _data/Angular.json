The latter part is what I would expect, given that all three lines define a class member implicitly typed `any` initialized as undefined, a falsy value. It appears, however, that the name \"true\" is somehow treated like a magic value.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising, and undocumented as far as I can tell. In fact, in modern projects this would be an error due to noImplicitAny as well as strictPropertyInitialization.\r\n\r\nThis could of course also be some ES quirk that I'm not familiar with, but at least this behaves as expected (in plain JS):\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test { true; }\r\nconst test = new Test();\r\nconsole.log(test.true); // undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell there's no test for this behavior in Angular, so I don't know if this works accidentally or whether in a time before noImplicitAny this was considered a feature. The documentation all the way back to v2 also doesn't mention this.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-5dzgsw?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n\r\nGiven that there are [StackOverflow posts dating back years](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35168683/hostbinding-with-a-variable-class-in-angular) I assume this has existed for a long, long time.\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^10.0.9\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^10.0.9\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^10.0.9\",\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40220","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HostBinding supports an undocumented magic property name(?)\" (#40220)"},{"Id":"772057289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-21T10:37:56","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"40219","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): memory leak if view container host view is destroyed while view ref is not","State":"open","Body":"When we attach a `ViewRef` to a `ViewContainerRef`, we save a reference to the container onto the `ViewRef` so that we can remove it when the ref is destroyed.

This change caused Angular CLI Karma plugin crash (https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/3588) because of the behaviour change. The culprit seems to be [this line](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/plugins/karma.ts#L329). On Node 14.15.2 this code will result in a `webpackReq.headers` being `undefined`, which leads to the crash in `webpack-dev-middleware` down the callstack. From the Node issue it looks like change is going to be reverted in 14.x, but maybe not in 15.x. So I think it still makes sense to adjust Angular CLI code to be compatible with the future Node release.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. `git clone git@github.com:devoto13/ng-test-crash.git`\r\n2. `cd ng-test-crash`\r\n3. `npm i`\r\n4. `npm test`\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>17 12 2020 16:06:15.208:ERROR [karma-server]: UnhandledRejection: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined\r\n17 12 2020 16:06:15.211:ERROR [karma-server]: TypeError: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined\r\n    at handleRangeHeaders (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/util.js:131:21)\r\n    at processRequest (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/middleware.js:98:19)\r\n    at ready (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/util.js:53:12)\r\n    at handleRequest (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/util.js:182:5)\r\n    at /Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/middleware.js:64:7\r\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\r\n    at middleware (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware/lib/middleware.js:63:12)\r\n    at /Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/plugins/karma.js:288:13\r\n    at call (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:183:5)\r\n    at /Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/karma/lib/web-server.js:24:9\r\n    at call (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:183:5)\r\n    at nullProxy (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/karma/lib/middleware/proxy.js:86:52)\r\n    at call (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (/Users/devoto13/Projects/trash/dummy/node_modules/connect/index.js:183:5)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 11.0.4\r\nNode: 14.15.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.4\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.4\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

See [Strict mode](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md) and [Options](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/api.md) for more details\n-   to make code injection from untrusted schemas impossible, [code generation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/codegen.md) is fully re-written to be type-level safe against code injection.\n-   to simplify Ajv extensions, the new keyword API that is used by pre-defined keywords is available to user-defined keywords - it is much easier to define any keywords now, especially with subschemas.\n-   schemas are compiled to ES6 code (ES5 code generation is supported with an option).\n-   to improve reliability and maintainability the code is migrated to TypeScript.\n-   separate Ajv classes from draft-07 and draft-2019-09 support with different default imports (see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv#usage) or [v7.0.0-beta.5](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.5) for the details).\n\n**Please note**:\n\n-   the support for JSON-Schema draft-04 is removed - if you have schemas using \"id\" attributes you have to replace them with \"\\\\$id\" (or continue using version 6 that will be supported until 02/28/2021).\n-   all formats are separated to [ajv-formats](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats) package - they have to be explicitly added if you use them.\n-   Ajv instance can only be created with `new` keyword, as Ajv is now ES6 class.\n-   browser bundles are automatically published to ajv-dist package (but still available on cdnjs.com).\n\n#### Better TypeScript support:\n\n-   Methods `compile` and `compileAsync` now return type-guards - see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/v7-beta#usage).\n-   Method `validate` is a type-guard.\n-   Better separation of asynchronous schemas on type level.\n-   Type utility JSONSchemaType<T> that generates the type for JSON Schema for type interface in the type parameter - it simplifies writing schemas (no unions support at the moment).\n\n#### API changes:\n\n-   addVocabulary - NEW method that allows to add an array of keyword definitions.\n-   addKeyword - keyword name should be passed as property in definition object, not as the first parameter (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning). Also \"inline\" keywords support is removed, code generation keywords can now be defined with \"code\" keyword - the same definition format that is used by all pre-defined keywords\n-   Ajv no longer allows to create the instance without `new` keyword (it is ES6 class). \n\n##### Added options (and defaults):\n\n-   strict: true - strict mode\n-   strictTypes: \"log\" - prevent mistakes related to type keywords and keyword applicability (see [Strict Types](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md#strict-types))\n-   strictTuples: \"log\" - prevent incomplete tuple schemas (see [Prohibit unconstrained tuples](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md#prohibit-unconstrained-tuples))\n-   allowUnionTypes: false - allow multiple non-null types in \"type\" keyword\n-   allowMatchingProperties: false - allow overlap between \"properties\" and \"patternProperties\" keywords\n-   loopEnum: Infinity - optimise validation of enums, similar to `loopRequired`\n-   validateFormats: true - enable format validation\n-   code: {optimize: number|boolean} - control [code optimisation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/codegen.md#code-optimization)\n-   code: {es5: true} - generate ES5 code, the default is to generate ES6 code.\n-   code: {lines: true} - add line breaks to generated code - simplifies debugging of compiled schemas when you need it\n\n##### Changed options:\n\n-   `keywords` - now expects the array of keyword definitions (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning)\n\n##### Removed options:\n\n-   errorDataPath - was deprecated, now removed.\n-   format - `validateFormats: false` can be used instead, old format mode can be chosen via ajv-formats package.\n-   nullable: `nullable` keyword is supported by default.\n-   jsonPointers: JSONPointers are used to report errors by default, `jsPropertySyntax: true` (deprecated) can be used if old format is needed.\n-   extendRefs: $ref siblings are validated by default (consistent with draft 2019-09), `ignoreKeywordsWithRef` (deprecated) can be used instead to ignore $ref siblings.\n-   missingRefs: now exception is always thrown.

It does make sense, since OverlayRef subscribes to `Location`'s events, not `Router`'s. But what's the point of `closeOnNavigation` option if it doesn't close on angular navigation? I've googled and haven't found an answer to my question, so I'm asking here. Why do you guys use `Location`'s events? It seems like [this code](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-ref.ts#L153) should look like\r\n```\r\n    if (this._config.disposeOnNavigation) {\r\n      this._locationChanges = this._router.events\r\n        .pipe(filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd))\r\n        .subscribe(() => this.dispose());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `this._router` is a `Router`'s instance.

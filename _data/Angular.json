One has to specifically search for it, but when using Angular it's not clear that the patched (standard) APIs may be incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the linked issues it has been asked already why the patch is not included by default, but no answer has been given before the issues were locked automatically, hence I'm trying to reach out again to find some insights on this. The only hint I find in the docs are these lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2fc5b70fcedb8ac35b825b245c0ae394dc125244/packages/zone.js/NON-STANDARD-APIS.md?plain=1#L239-L242\r\n\r\nHowever these are clearly outdated, as all major browsers [support the API](https://caniuse.com/resizeobserver) nowadays. In fact, with the `resize` event potentially [not firing anymore for arbitrary elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event), the `ResizeObserver` is essential for responding to size changes, and I'd thus expect it to be quite common in use.\r\n\r\nWith the available information from the linked issues and the existing patch it should be fairly simple to enable this by default, and I can create a PR if desired. But I also wanted to verify if there is a reason for leaving it out intentionally before putting any work into it, or if it's just an oversight?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nzone-js 0.12.0, 0.11.8\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48890","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ResizeObserver should be patched automatically by zone.js\" (#48890)"},{"Id":"1562354502","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-31T07:23:51","Actor":"digeomel","Number":"48883","RawContent":null,"Title":"Why is webpack-bundle-analyzer strongly *not* recommended?","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nFor a long time, developers have been using webpack-bundle-analyzer to analyze Angular app bundle sizes.

As an example:\r\n```\r\n<label for=\"my-toggle-switch\">My Toggle Switch</label>\r\n<toggle-switch id=\"my-toggle-switch\"></toggle-switch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `toggle-switch` component accepts that id as an input and places it on a `button` like this:\r\n```\r\n<button [id]=\"id\" role=\"switch\" [attr.aria-checked]=\"state\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe outcome is a DOM that looks something like this:\r\n```\r\n<label for=\"my-toggle-switch\">My Toggle Switch</label>\r\n<toggle-switch>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <button id=\"my-toggle-switch\" ...>\r\n      <!-- ... -->\r\n    </button>\r\n  </div>\r\n</toggle-switch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-label-element), the preceding HTML structure should yield an association between the button and the label. Clicking the label should focus and activate the button, and the button should have an accessible label that matches the label content. \r\n\r\nThat is not happening currently when the label exists outside the component. As a test, I placed the label inside the component and the appropriate association was made.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.10\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.10\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.10\r\n@angular/material               14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48886","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Label `for` attribute will not associate to the corresponding id of an input element inside another component\" (#48886)"},{"Id":"1561677776","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-30T17:03:25","Actor":"sam-s4s","Number":"48881","RawContent":null,"Title":"urlUpdateStrategy: 'eager' - not working","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo (though it is possible this may have worked in a version prior to 13, which is the earliest I have tried it in).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nurlUpdateStrategy: 'eager' does not appear to be working.

I have an app with a just common lazy loaded module which uses HttpClientModule (and HttpClient). While it compiles and works locally (!), when I deploy it and go to that specific route __*nothing happens*__. I mean you click on a button but really nothing happens. There are no errors in the console either!\r\n\r\nIt's good I have a global error handler which logs all of the errors. So, I found out the error was:\r\n> Error: Uncaught (in promise): ReferenceError: Cannot access 'P' before initialization\r\n\r\nFirst, I thought I had a cyclic reference somewhere... so I checked everything and no, I didn't have it. Then I just added HttpClientModule to my module's `imports` and published the app again. Voila! It works now!\r\n\r\nI have to add my app uses i18n, so I build it for different languages.

After the upgrade, I noticed that 'ng serve' incremental build times had increased from around (15s - 25s) on Angular v12 to (115s - 130s) on Angular v15. This kind of degradation in build performance was not expected.  Here are my settings in the angular.json file for our 'development' config. \r\n\r\n  \"development\": {\r\n              \"buildOptimizer\": false,\r\n              \"optimization\": false,\r\n              \"vendorChunk\": true,\r\n              \"extractLicenses\": false,\r\n              \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n              \"namedChunks\": true,\r\n              \"aot\": false,\r\n              \"progress\": true\r\n            }\r\n\r\nI tried a number of thing to see if I could bring down the time. One that gave a limited improvement was to move the entries from the \"scripts\" section in the angular.json file and directly reference them in the index.html file via script tags instead. This reduced the incremental build times to (95s - 100s) \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI wasn't able to reproduce issue in a smaller application and I can't share our code base. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.4\r\nNode: 14.21.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.17\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.0.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1500.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.4\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.0.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.41\r\n@angular/material               15.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.4\r\nrxjs                            6.6.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24634","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve Incremental Build Times Increased Massively When Upgrading From Angular v12 -> v15\" (#24634)"},{"Id":"1564023491","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-31T10:15:57","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24633","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@bazel/buildifier](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) | devDependencies | patch | [`6.0.0` -> `6.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fbuildifier/6.0.0/6.0.1) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.49.0` -> `5.50.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2feslint-plugin/5.49.0/5.50.0) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.49.0` -> `5.50.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/5.49.0/5.50.0) |\n| [sass](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass) | dependencies | minor | [`1.57.1` -> `1.58.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/sass/1.57.1/1.58.0) |\n| [sass](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass) | devDependencies | minor | [`1.57.1` -> `1.58.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/sass/1.57.1/1.58.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/buildtools</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases/tag/6.0.1): (2023-01-31)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/compare/6.0.0...6.0.1)\n\n-   `.buildifier.json` config file\n    -

You can now add the `const` modifier on a type parameter of a function, method, or class like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <const T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] });\n    ```\n\n    The type of `names` in the above example is `readonly [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"]`. Marking the type parameter as `const` behaves as if you had written `as const` at every use instead. The above code is equivalent to the following TypeScript, which was the only option before TypeScript 5.0:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] } as const);\n    ```\n\n    You can read [the announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/#const-type-parameters) for more information.\n\n-   Make parsing generic `async` arrow functions more strict in `.tsx` files\n\n    Previously esbuild's TypeScript parser incorrectly accepted the following code as valid:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T> () => {};\n    ```\n\n    The official TypeScript parser rejects this code because it thinks it's the identifier `async` followed by a JSX element starting with `<T>`. So with this release, esbuild will now reject this syntax in `.tsx` files too. You'll now have to add a comma after the type parameter to get generic arrow functions like this to parse in `.tsx` files:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T,> () => {};\n    ```\n\n-   Allow the `in` and `out` type parameter modifiers on class expressions\n\n    TypeScript 4.7 added the `in` and `out` modifiers on the type parameters of classes, interfaces, and type aliases. However, while TypeScript supported them on both class expressions and class statements, previously esbuild only supported them on class statements due to an oversight. This release now allows these modifiers on class expressions too:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare let Foo: any;\n    Foo = class <in T> { };\n    Foo = class <out T> { };\n    ```\n\n-   Update `enum` constant folding for TypeScript 5.0\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 contains an [updated definition of what it considers a constant expression](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/50528):\n\n    > An expression is considered a *constant expression* if it is\n    >\n    > -   a number or string literal,\n    > -   a unary `+`, `-`, or `~` applied to a numeric constant expression,\n    > -   a binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `|`, `&`, `^` applied to two numeric constant expressions,\n    > -   a binary `+` applied to two constant expressions whereof at least one is a string,\n    > -   a template expression where each substitution expression is a constant expression,\n    > -   a parenthesized constant expression,\n    > -   a dotted name (e.g. `x.y.z`) that references a `const` variable with a constant expression initializer and no type annotation,\n    > -   a dotted name that references an enum member with an enum literal type, or\n    > -   a dotted name indexed by a string literal (e.g. `x.y[\"z\"]`) that references an enum member with an enum literal type.\n\n    This impacts esbuild's implementation of TypeScript's `const enum` feature. With this release, esbuild will now attempt to follow these new rules. For example, you can now initialize an `enum` member with a template literal expression that contains a numeric constant:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original input\n    const enum Example {\n      COUNT = 100,\n      ERROR = `Expected ${COUNT} items`,\n    }\n    console.log(\n      Example.COUNT,\n      Example.ERROR,\n    )\n\n    // Old output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    var Example = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Example2) => {\n      Example2[Example2[\"COUNT\"] = 100] = \"COUNT\";\n      Example2[Example2[\"ERROR\"] = `Expected ${100 /* COUNT */} items`] = \"ERROR\";\n      return Example2;\n    })(Example || {});\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      Example.ERROR\n    );\n\n    // New output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      \"Expected 100 items\" /* ERROR */\n    );\n    ```\n\n    These rules are not followed exactly due to esbuild's limitations. The rule about dotted references to `const` variables is not followed both because esbuild's enum processing is done in an isolated module setting and because doing so would potentially require esbuild to use a type system, which it doesn't have. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    // The TypeScript compiler inlines this but esbuild doesn't:\n    declare const x = 'foo'\n    const enum Foo { X = x }\n    console.log(Foo.X)\n    ```\n\n    Also, the rule that requires converting numbers to a string currently only followed for 32-bit signed integers and non-finite numbers. This is done to avoid accidentally introducing a bug if esbuild's number-to-string operation doesn't exactly match the behavior of a real JavaScript VM. Currently esbuild's number-to-string constant folding is conservative for safety.\n\n-   Forbid definite assignment assertion operators on class methods\n\n    In TypeScript, class methods can use the `?` optional property operator but not the `!` definite assignment assertion operator (while class fields can use both):\n\n    ```ts\n    class Foo {\n      // These are valid TypeScript\n      a?\n      b!\n      x?() {}\n\n      // This is invalid TypeScript\n      y!() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly allowed the definite assignment assertion operator with class methods. This will no longer be allowed starting with this release.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.33.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.33.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.32.0...v8.33.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`2cc7954`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2cc7954cdb1fed44e8a5d3c9b3ea1deceadb5e00) feat: add `restrictDefaultExports` option to no-restricted-exports rule ([#&#8203;16785](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16785)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`17f4be2`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/17f4be2b66deb81f4e9ffb3d6bdfb79f3fcf85a2) docs: Fix examples in no-multiple-empty-lines rule ([#&#8203;16835](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16835)) (jonz94)\n-   [`9c7cfe3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9c7cfe33c4a39cf2c23529afe02030ea7f8acf70) docs: 'Source Code' content in 'Set up Development Environment' page ([#&#8203;16780](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16780)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ede5c64`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ede5c6475469a905da4f559ab55f0ee73168a9d7) docs: Custom processors page ([#&#8203;16802](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16802)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`2620614`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2620614f525de13f2e3ab0a7cd92abe89dae4897) docs: Code of Conduct page ([#&#8203;16781](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16781)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`50a8efd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/50a8efd957c70c9978a8ed25744a24193b00e078) docs: report a sec vulnerability page ([#&#8203;16808](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16808)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ed60afd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ed60afd4450e769a975447178299446f4439d926) docs: Update page titles, section landing pages, and side TOC ([#&#8203;16760](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16760)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`333c712`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/333c71243537966930e9ab8178bc98c37949b5f2) docs: add background to code-path-diagrams for dark-mode ([#&#8203;16822](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16822)) (Tanuj Kanti)\n-   [`f5f7b9b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f5f7b9b8b512f5c6a5b4a1037f81bb3f5a7311e0) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2aa4f5f`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2aa4f5fb2fdb1c4a1734093c225e5c6251b0ee0f) docs: no-constant-condition: Add multi-comparison example ([#&#8203;16776](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16776)) (Sebastian Simon)\n-   [`40287db`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/40287dbe7407934a69805f02ece07491778c3694) docs: Remove Google Group icon ([#&#8203;16779](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16779)) (Nicholas C.

See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+import.meta.url+\r\n\r\nThis issue, which describes the problem well: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388 was closed bcause it's actually Webpack's fault and Webpack *used* to unconditionally rewrite `import.meta.url` to something useless in the absence of a loader.  But now we can stop Webpack from doing that, using the `parser.javascript.importMeta` option: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/15246\r\n\r\n... except that to do this in Angular requires a custom webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nSince we are not supposed to have webpack-specific configuration in the angular config, it would be nice if the default behaviour of Angular was non-broken.  Obviously it would have to be done while conserving the (arguably broken and inconsistent) policy of *sometimes* using loaders and *sometimes* not using them.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSomething about not being able to access local content\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.1.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\nwebpack                         5.75.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24616","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular should disable webpack's import.meta.url parsing by default\" (#24616)"},{"Id":"1559195931","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-27T05:22:47","Actor":"dhdaines","Number":"24617","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular should *not* disable Webpack's import.meta.url parsing (for WebAssembly files, at least)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nActually, Angular should just make up its h*cking mind (see #24616).\r\n\r\nCurrently, its mysterious and ephemeral built-in webpack configuration *disables* [module.parser.javascript.url](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascripturl), so assets imported with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` do not get packaged by default.\r\n\r\nOkay, that's fine, if you're into that kind of thing, but at the same time it keeps [module.parser.java.importmeta](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascriptimportmeta) enabled, leading webpack to output entirely useless `file://` URLs instead of doing any packaging.\r\n\r\nEnd result is that you just can't use any ES6 module (such as *anything* compiled with Emscripten's `EXPORT_ES6` option) that tries to load some possibly really important asset, like, say, a WebAssembly file.  You are damned if you do and damned if you don't!  If you do what is suggested in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22351 and try to use the `assets` option, the actually generated code will *not* reference this asset because `import.meta.url` got rewritten to some path on your build filesystem.\r\n\r\nBut if you then disable `module.parser.java.importmeta` manually in a custom webpack config, then you end up with `import.meta.url` in the output code, which utterly breaks testing with karma (since karma does not do ES6 modules, because that's like not groovy, man) and of course also any possibility of targeting a non-ES6-aware browser.\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of webpack's perfectly good and sane defaults.  A reasonable workaround is to create a custom webpack config which *enables* `module.parser.java.url`, like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  module: {\r\n    parser: {\r\n      javascript: {\r\n        url: true,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nFrom an Angular app, try to load an ES6 module (like https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundswallower?activeTab=explore) that has an accompanying WASM file, or any kind of asset that is loaded with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`.  The relevant code output by Emscripten is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n wasmBinaryFile = new URL(\"soundswallower.web.wasm\", import.meta.url).href;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No

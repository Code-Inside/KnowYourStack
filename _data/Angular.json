This linker will be available as a Babel plugin for maximum compatibility with all Angular build processes, and will be integrated into the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\nThis proposal replaces the current system of publishing libraries in View Engine format, and running ngcc, the Angular compatibility compiler, to upgrade them to Ivy after `npm install`.\r\n\r\nAs part of upgrading the APF, we're also proposing standardizing on ES2015 as a publication format.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThe Angular ecosystem is currently in a transitional period as applications update from the View Engine to the Ivy runtime. During this period it was essential that the library ecosystem on NPM remain compatible with View Engine applications. To achieve this, libraries are always built and published in \"View Engine format\", which ensures compatibility with all existing View Engine applications, including those using Angular 9+ and opting out of Ivy.\r\n\r\nTo enable Ivy applications to consume these View Engine libraries, we introduced the Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc). ngcc runs as part of an Ivy application's build process and updates any View Engine libraries in `node_modules` to use the Ivy runtime. This allows the Ivy app to build against View Engine libraries.\r\n\r\nAs we deprecated View Engine runtime and will remove it completely in a future version of Angular, this compatibility is only needed temporarily, after which libraries can ship on NPM in a format that's directly compatible with Ivy. This RFC proposes such an \"Ivy-native\" library format.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\nWe considered the following goals to be essential requirements which ensure the health and stability of the Angular ecosystem:\r\n\r\n1. **Low-friction integration with non-CLI build tooling.**\r\n\r\nMany applications use the Angular CLI to build, but not all. Like with ngcc, it must be straightforward for non-CLI builds to consume Ivy libraries from NPM. Not all Angular projects are able to use the CLI.\r\n\r\nFor example, previously lazy loading in Angular was extremely difficult or impossible to achieve without using the Angular CLI (or the Webpack plugin) and even then it only worked with the `@angular/router`. In Angular 8 lazy loading was supported via ES dynamic import(), which allowed for lazy loading of Angular modules and components independently of the toolchain in use.\r\n\r\n2. **No in-place modification of node_modules.**\r\n\r\nA key aspect of ngcc's design is that it updates libraries in-place in `node_modules`. This was needed to ensure compatibility with existing build tooling, and because changes to library .d.ts files were required for downstream compilations.\r\n\r\nMutating `node_modules` causes a number of problems: Package managers frequently overwrite such updates, requiring expensive re-runs of ngcc. Certain tools such as PNPM also rely on the immutability of `node_modules` and are simply not compatible with ngcc as a result.\r\n\r\nThis was acceptable since ngcc is a temporary solution, but in the long term mutating `node_modules` should not be a part of our strategy for libraries.\r\n\r\n3. **Maintaining Angular's guarantees of library compatibility.**\r\n\r\nAngular formally guarantees that a library built with a major version X will be compatible with an application using version X+1. For example, Angular 8 libraries can be used from applications built with Angular 9.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this compatibility often extends much further, and there have been very few breakages since the original Angular 2.0 release.\r\n\r\n4. **Generated Ivy instructions do not become public API.**\r\n\r\nThe code generation API of the Ivy runtime, like that of View Engine, should remain private API. That is, Ivy instructions should not be published to NPM, as that would severely limit Angular's ability to evolve and optimize the runtime in the future.\r\n\r\n# Feedback Requested\r\n\r\nThe Angular team is interested in any and all feedback from our community regarding this proposal. There are a few aspects of this design where we feel this feedback will be especially valuable:\r\n\r\n* For application developers that use a custom build process instead of the Angular CLI, what challenges do you anticipate integrating the linker into your build process? How does this compare to using ngcc today? Would something other than a Babel plugin work well for you?\r\n\r\n* For application developers who use the UMD package format in some way (e.g. with server-side rendering), what challenges do you anticipate if Angular libraries no longer ship with UMD bundles? What could the Angular CLI do to alleviate those challenges?\r\n\r\n* For authors of Angular utilities that rely on `.metadata.json` information, what does your tooling do, and how are you using the metadata files? What could we provide to ensure your tools are still able to function?\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\n## The compilation lifecycle of Angular libraries\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of Angular compilation in the previous View Engine architecture is that libraries have their NgFactory code generated at application build time, using the same version of the Angular compiler as the application itself. This has several important effects:\r\n\r\n* It ensures libraries are compatible with a wide range of Angular versions, including future versions, which satisfies requirement 3.\r\n* Code generated for View Engine NgFactory classes is never published to NPM, satisfying requirement 4.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this approach requires that libraries are shipped on NPM with the metadata required to run Angular compilation later, during the application build. For View Engine, this is achieved through `.metadata.json` files which are published alongside each JS file.\r\n\r\nFor Ivy libraries, we propose a modification of this architecture, which maintains its benefits while optimizing for application build efficiency. Instead of performing all compilation at application build time, Ivy libraries will be compiled in two phases:\r\n\r\nPrior to publication on NPM, the library is compiled with the Ivy compiler in a special library mode. Instead of generating `.metadata.json` files, the compiler collects metadata for each component and emits it into the component class itself, in place of the normal Ivy component definition.\r\n\r\nDuring the application build, a \"linker\" tool processes each library file and completes compilation of each component, replacing the inline metadata with a full component definition.\r\n\r\n### Pre-publication compilation\r\n\r\nPrior to publication on NPM, an Ivy library will be compiled by `ngc` in a library mode. This operation analyzes the declared Angular types in the library (any components, directives, etc) and produces self-contained metadata which is inlined into the component class in place of the Ivy component definition.\r\n\r\nUnlike with View Engine's `.metadata.json` files, the inlined component metadata is \"self-contained\" - it has all of the information needed to compile that component, without the need to reference any other files (such as the NgModule or any consumed directives/pipes/etc). This means that the final compilation step can be performed on a component-by-component basis, opening up lots of opportunities for caching and parallelization.\r\n\r\n### Application build \"linking\"\r\n\r\nAn application will install many Angular libraries from NPM into its `node_modules`. The code in these libraries cannot be bundled directly along with the built application as it is not fully compiled. Compilation must be finished by running a new Angular tool which translates the inline metadata into final component definitions. We call this process \"linking\" and the tool the \"Angular linker\".\r\n\r\nThe linker scans its inputs for inline Angular metadata, extracts it, and replaces it with a compiled component. Because this process happens during the application build, it uses the same version of the Angular compiler, ensuring that the app and all of its libraries are built with a single version of Angular.\r\n\r\n### The linker as a Babel plugin\r\n\r\nTo satisfy requirement 1, it makes sense to implement the linker as a Babel plugin. Babel has become a de facto standard for JS tooling, and babel plugins can be used in a variety of environments. Webpack and Rollup can both use Babel plugins, in addition to standalone Babel itself.\r\n\r\nAs a Babel plugin, the linker will receive an input AST corresponding to a particular library file, and transform it, replacing the inline metadata with a compiled component definition and maintaining the correct source mapping.\r\n\r\nIt's also common for Babel plugins to support some kind of build caching. We can take advantage of this in the linker plugin to make repeat compilations virtually free. Effectively, then, libraries will only need to be processed by the linker a single time, regardless of other NPM operations (unlike ngcc which often needed to be re-run if NPM or yarn reverted changes ngcc made to `node_modules`).\r\n\r\n### Integration with Angular Tooling\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI will integrate the linker plugin automatically, so users of the CLI will be able to install Ivy-native libraries from NPM without any additional configuration.\r\n\r\nOn the publication side, ng-packagr will be updated with the capability to publish libraries in the Ivy-native format as well, meaning that any existing libraries which use it will be trivially able to switch over.\r\n\r\n## Removing UMD from the APF\r\n\r\nAs part of updating the Angular Package Format, we're standardizing on ES2015 as the publication format for libraries. This means that UMD bundles will no longer be published as part of Angular packages.\r\n\r\nES5 support was dropped in the previous version of the APF, and Angular tooling now downlevels ES2015 sources on NPM to ES5 as needed. This approach has been working extremely well, and we feel that UMD could be handled in a similar way.\r\n\r\nUsing ES2015 as the \"source format of truth\" strikes a balance between flexibility for translation into other needed formats, and ease of use with most tooling and browsers able to consume ES2015 without modification (so post-processing isn't required).\r\n\r\n# Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\nThis section summarizes potential alternative designs that were considered and rejected. See the linker design doc for more details.\r\n\r\n## Shipping instructions directly to NPM\r\n\r\nIt would theoretically be possible to compile libraries directly in Ivy mode, and ship the resulting artifacts to NPM directly. Downstream consumers would not need to perform any extra build steps to consume such libraries.\r\n\r\nHowever, this idea runs into a number of issues with the requirements listed above:\r\n\r\n* It complicates library compatibility, especially across major versions of Angular.\r\n* It greatly increases the difficulty of changing the Angular runtime, since all runtime instructions would become \"public API\" of Angular.\r\n\r\n## Continuing to use ngcc\r\n\r\nIt's possible that ngcc could be adapted to continue to work indefinitely. However, ngcc has several undesirable characteristics that fail to meet our requirements for a long-term library solution:\r\n\r\n* It mutates node_modules, making it incompatible with a number of other tools in the JS ecosystem.\r\n* It requires expensive processing that's hard to cache, since it consumes entire packages as input instead of individual files.\r\n\r\n# Additional Resources\r\n\r\n* [Design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148eXrCST6TM7Uo90KxaBrMbOkwJbYrQSQgRaGMK5WRc/edit#) for the Angular Linker concept","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38366","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: Ivy Library Distribution\" (#38366)"},{"Id":"673992535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T16:01:47","Actor":"ajitsinghkaler","Number":"38360","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove https://angular.io from internal links","State":"closed","Body":"PR #36601 introduces icons on all links if the link contains\r\nhttps:// or http:// but there were some internal links left\r\nwhich contained https://angular.io.

Note that listening to step change events does not work, because with a linear stepper with invalid steps, clicking on next will complete the step, without actually moving to another step.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is to add a `@ViewChildren(MatStep) matSteps` and then manually do `matSteps[1].completed = true;`\r\n\r\nHowever, this requires a lot of extra code, and it’s never clear if the child really expects its properties to be changed directly that way.\r\n\r\nMore importantly though, you can *visibly* see the stepper load in a non-completed state, and only visibly transition to completed once all the step contents have been loaded.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.0.0\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome Version 84.0.4147.94 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System: Google Chrome OS Version 84.0.4147.94 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20215","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatStepper): MatStep’s `completed` should be a 2 way binding\" (#20215)"},{"Id":"674177649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T09:41:12","Actor":"devversion","Number":"20214","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix release output containing invalid imports sometimes","State":"open","Body":"Resubmit of #20201 with an updated patch.

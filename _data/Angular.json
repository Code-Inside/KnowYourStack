But, if we do provide `undefined` as a value, the compiler complains, as the value couldn't be `undefined`, even though at runtime, they are both the same. \r\nHaving that many components have inputs that are technically mandatory, as the components could not properly run without them, having this kind of type checking should provide allot of value.\r\n\r\nI know that this was discussed in the past, but having that now, Angular started promoting strict mode, maybe we should address this again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Treat the missing attributes as if `undefined` was provided as value. As there is no runtime difference between them.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> I've considered the workarounds that were recommended in other places, but none of them were satisfactory:\r\n- using the selector to make it mandatory 'prefix-component[value]' -- But the errors received here, are misleading, as it complains that the component does not exist, instead of complaining about the attribute type. \r\n- throwing errors at runtime -- Again, this is wrong, as this should be a compilation error, because it's not different than a function with parameters or class constructor with parameters. Why should the component be any different? Besides this, pushing typing errors at runtime isn't a good practice, as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript and also increases the change that the issue will go unnoticed, if this is an edge case.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40390","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mandatory inputs, missing attributes vs undefined values\" (#40390)"},{"Id":"782818513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-11T17:57:46","Actor":"Pedro-D13","Number":"40380","RawContent":null,"Title":"Minor Grammatical change","State":"closed","Body":"Instead of  'In an SPA ...'\r\n\r\nthe suggested change is 'in a SPA ...' 👍🏿\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If 'ngTemplateOutle' is an Angular directive, then add 'CommonModule' to the '@NgModule.imports' of this component.\r\n2. To allow any property add 'NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA' to the '@NgModule.schemas' of this component. (\"\r\n    <!-- ngTemplateOutlet is mispelled below -->\r\n    <ng-container [ERROR ->]*ngTemplateOutle=\"myTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n    <ng-template #myTemplate>\r\n      My template is here\")\r\nProperty binding ngTemplateOutle not used by any directive on an embedded template. Make sure that the property name is spelled correctly and all directives are listed in the \"@NgModule.declarations\". (\"\r\n    <!-- ngTemplateOutlet is mispelled below -->\r\n    [ERROR ->]<ng-container *ngTemplateOutle=\"myTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n    <ng-template #myTemplate>\r\n      My te\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Ivy & AOT with all the strict Angular template flags enabled the above code compiles fine, i.e. no error is thrown, which I've learned the hard way. Not throwing any compile or runtime error on invalid Angular templates makes working with them more dangerous than it should be.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nMinimal reproduction in https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-ivy-no-error-invalid-structural-directive. https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-ivy-no-error-invalid-structural-directive/blob/master/src/app/app.component.ts contains the broken code, which by default compiles with no error.\r\n\r\nSwapping `enableIvy` to `false` in https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-ivy-no-error-invalid-structural-directive/blob/master/tsconfig.json makes the compiler throw an error.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.6\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                    11.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.6\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy no longer report invalid structural directives / schema errors on NgTemplate\" (#40388)"},{"Id":"783162238","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-11T08:13:23","Actor":"belchevgb","Number":"40387","RawContent":null,"Title":"Memory leak in tests with zone.js >= 0.9.0","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package:\r\n**zone.js: 0.9.0**\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nYes.

When I call **clearTimeout()** in ngOnDestroy() I can see that the task is not removed from tasksByHandleId because it's status is **notScheduled**.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[Reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-omxwmy?file=src/app/app.component.ts)\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.6\r\nNode: 14.3.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                    11.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.6\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\nzone.js                         0.10.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n[SNAPSHOT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7tUuZZPBdiOS1amHcBLWNXWhRNzArKo/view?usp=sharing)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15705336/104160957-a92a8e80-53fa-11eb-870b-656e9e946189.png)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40387","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Memory leak in tests with zone.js >= 0.9.0\" (#40387)"},{"Id":"783041134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-11T07:20:33","Actor":"JounQin","Number":"40385","RawContent":null,"Title":"User `ngTemplateOutletContext` been modified unexpectedly","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug?

THURSDAY : THURSDAY + 7) - firstDayOfYear);\r\n  ret.setFullYear(year); // added line\r\n  return ret;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getThursdayThisWeek(datetime: Date) {\r\n  const ret = new Date(\r\n      datetime.getFullYear(), datetime.getMonth(),\r\n      datetime.getDate() + (THURSDAY - datetime.getDay()));\r\n  ret.setFullYear(datetime.getFullYear()); // added line\r\n  return ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-rlvhyx?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version: 11**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.5\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.5\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.5\r\nng-packagr                      11.0.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n    \r\nDone in 0.36s.\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"angular v11 - bug in 2 functions in angular/packages/common/src/i18n/format_date.ts\" (#40377)"},{"Id":"782479835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-10T00:37:29","Actor":"hamfastgamgee","Number":"40372","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 11.0.6 and 11.0.7: Componentless routes broken in IE11 when navigating","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 11.0.5\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Trying to activate a route in IE11 using Angular 11.0.6 or 11.0.7 with default Angular CLI polyfill configuration results in an error about Object.values not being found, as IE11 doesn't support that by default.

(The only one I care about is IE11, although I'm not sure if that's the only one in the list of browsers supported by Angular.)  I can easily add a polyfill for Object.values, but Angular itself shouldn't require any modifications to the default polyfills provided by the CLI simply to run out-of-the-box functionality.\r\n<!-- ✍️Do any of these matter: operating system, IDE, package manager, HTTP server, ...?

Needed to add these same components to a monorepo (ng11 and nativecript 7) that by default was set to use .scss for all styles.\r\n\r\nI manually ported over the files by adding new folders/files in the code base and set the extension for all component styling files to be .scss then copy and pasted over the css from my ng 8 project.\r\n\r\nAfter doing all this and running ng serve in my monorepo none of my component or global styles are showing up when I compile. I am using reset.scss in the code base as well.\r\n\r\nAnother dev on my team has pulled down my same branch and compiled with no issues and all his styling at the component and global levels are working correctly, which lead us to believe it is an issue with my local machine. \r\n\r\nPossibly something with cli and the fact that I previously was working in .css projects then switched to .scss?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate a .css ng 8 project and add some basic styling. Then port over that styling to a separate new ng11/ns monorepo project that uses .scss by manually creating the component folders and files then copy and pasting .css from ng 8 project in and run ng serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nNode: 15.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n...

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;300-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare300-rc1300-2020-12-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.2...3.0.0)\n\n> ### For a full list for the breaking changes in 3.0.0 and other notes on migrating, see the [Migrating to 3.0.0 wiki](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30) page.\n>\n> ##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** only pass kwargs to the test, not the .update binary ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2361)) ([afa095b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/afa095b))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **builtin:** remove node_modules attribute from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & ts_library ([c2927af](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c2927af))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **builtin:** We removed the node_modules attribute from `nodejs_binary`, `nodejs_test`, `jasmine_node_test` & `ts_library`.\n\nIf you are using the `node_modules` attribute, you can simply add the target specified there to the `data` or `deps` attribute of the rule instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nor\n\n    ts_library(\n        name = \"lib\",\n        srcs = glob([\"*.ts\"]),\n        tsconfig = \":tsconfig.json\",\n        deps = [\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"],\n    )\n\nWe also dropped support for filegroup based node_modules target and removed `node_modules_filegroup` from `index.bzl`.\n\nIf you are using this feature for user-managed deps, you must now a `js_library` target\nwith `external_npm_package` set to `True` instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    js_library(\n        name = \"node_modules\",\n        srcs = glob(\n            include = [\n                \"node_modules/**/*.js\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.d.ts\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.json\",\n                \"node_modules/.bin/*\",\n            ],\n            exclude = [\n    ### Files under test & docs may contain file names that\n    ### are not legal Bazel labels (e.g.,\n    ### node_modules/ecstatic/test/public/中文/檔案.html)\n                \"node_modules/**/test/**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/docs/**\",\n    ### Files with spaces in the name are not legal Bazel labels\n                \"node_modules/**/* */**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/* *\",\n            ],\n        ),\n    ### Provide ExternalNpmPackageInfo which is used by downstream rules\n    ### that use these npm dependencies\n        external_npm_package = True,\n    )\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \":node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nSee `examples/user_managed_deps` for a working example of user-managed npm dependencies.\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n**Note**: this is likely the last 2.x release of rules_nodejs, we expect 3.0.0 next week.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        sha256 = \"b3521b29c7cb0c47a1a735cce7e7e811a4f80d8e3720cf3a1b624533e4bb7cb6\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/2.3.2/rules_nodejs-2.3.2.tar.gz\"],\n    )\n\nand update your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to `latest`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** add DeclarationInfo sources from dependencies as inputs to npm_package_bin driven actions ([#&#8203;2353](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2353)) ([85dc132](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/85dc132))\n-   **builtin:** give better error when linker runs

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;300-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare300-rc1300-2020-12-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.2...3.0.0)\n\n> ### For a full list for the breaking changes in 3.0.0 and other notes on migrating, see the [Migrating to 3.0.0 wiki](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30) page.\n>\n> ##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** only pass kwargs to the test, not the .update binary ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2361)) ([afa095b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/afa095b))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **builtin:** remove node_modules attribute from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & ts_library ([c2927af](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c2927af))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **builtin:** We removed the node_modules attribute from `nodejs_binary`, `nodejs_test`, `jasmine_node_test` & `ts_library`.\n\nIf you are using the `node_modules` attribute, you can simply add the target specified there to the `data` or `deps` attribute of the rule instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nor\n\n    ts_library(\n        name = \"lib\",\n        srcs = glob([\"*.ts\"]),\n        tsconfig = \":tsconfig.json\",\n        deps = [\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"],\n    )\n\nWe also dropped support for filegroup based node_modules target and removed `node_modules_filegroup` from `index.bzl`.\n\nIf you are using this feature for user-managed deps, you must now a `js_library` target\nwith `external_npm_package` set to `True` instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    js_library(\n        name = \"node_modules\",\n        srcs = glob(\n            include = [\n                \"node_modules/**/*.js\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.d.ts\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.json\",\n                \"node_modules/.bin/*\",\n            ],\n            exclude = [\n    ### Files under test & docs may contain file names that\n    ### are not legal Bazel labels (e.g.,\n    ### node_modules/ecstatic/test/public/中文/檔案.html)\n                \"node_modules/**/test/**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/docs/**\",\n    ### Files with spaces in the name are not legal Bazel labels\n                \"node_modules/**/* */**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/* *\",\n            ],\n        ),\n    ### Provide ExternalNpmPackageInfo which is used by downstream rules\n    ### that use these npm dependencies\n        external_npm_package = True,\n    )\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \":node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nSee `examples/user_managed_deps` for a working example of user-managed npm dependencies.\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n**Note**: this is likely the last 2.x release of rules_nodejs, we expect 3.0.0 next week.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        sha256 = \"b3521b29c7cb0c47a1a735cce7e7e811a4f80d8e3720cf3a1b624533e4bb7cb6\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/2.3.2/rules_nodejs-2.3.2.tar.gz\"],\n    )\n\nand update your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to `latest`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** add DeclarationInfo sources from dependencies as inputs to npm_package_bin driven actions ([#&#8203;2353](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2353)) ([85dc132](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/85dc132))\n-   **builtin:** give better error when linker runs on Node &lt;10 ([c344401](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c344401)), closes [#&#8203;2304](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2304)\n-   **examples:** fix jest example on windows ([cc04f6c](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cc04f6c)), closes [#&#8203;1454](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1454)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow running NPM tools from execroot ([#&#8203;2297](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2297))

It's already present in `keywords`, but overruled due to `propsKeywords`.\r\n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b3ed8aa4ad6736130bd9603ebf681b229c16f2b2/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/visitor.ts#L169-L176\r\n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b3ed8aa4ad6736130bd9603ebf681b229c16f2b2/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/visitor.ts#L153-L156\r\n- The visitor passes the grandparent schema object rather than the parent schema when visiting any of the `propsKeywords` values (`sch` vs. `schema` at line 197).\r\n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b3ed8aa4ad6736130bd9603ebf681b229c16f2b2/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/visitor.ts#L189-L201\r\n  This breaks the visitor in flatten as it tries to replace a `$ref` with the value it references:\r\n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b3ed8aa4ad6736130bd9603ebf681b229c16f2b2/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.ts#L288\r\n\r\nThese two bugs each lead to `CoreSchemaRegistry#flatten` not actually flattening properties inside items.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nExecuting the following file will print `{ '$ref': '#/definitions/pattern' }`\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Toggle file</summary>\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst {json} = require('@angular-devkit/core');\r\n\r\nconst registry = new json.schema.CoreSchemaRegistry();\r\n\r\nregistry\r\n  .flatten({\r\n    type: 'object',\r\n    properties: {\r\n      assets: {\r\n        type: 'array',\r\n        items: {\r\n          type: 'object',\r\n          properties: {\r\n            include: {\r\n              $ref: '#/definitions/pattern',\r\n            },\r\n            exclude: {\r\n              $ref: '#/definitions/pattern',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    definitions: {\r\n      pattern: {\r\n        oneOf: [\r\n          {\r\n            type: 'string',\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            type: 'array',\r\n            items: {\r\n              type: 'string',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        ],\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  })\r\n  .subscribe(flattened => {\r\n    console.log(flattened.properties.assets.items.properties.include);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nø\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\nPresent on master, tested on 11.0.5.\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;300-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare300-rc1300-2020-12-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.2...3.0.0)\n\n> ### For a full list for the breaking changes in 3.0.0 and other notes on migrating, see the [Migrating to 3.0.0 wiki](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30) page.\n>\n> ##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** only pass kwargs to the test, not the .update binary ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2361)) ([afa095b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/afa095b))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **builtin:** remove node_modules attribute from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & ts_library ([c2927af](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c2927af))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **builtin:** We removed the node_modules attribute from `nodejs_binary`, `nodejs_test`, `jasmine_node_test` & `ts_library`.\n\nIf you are using the `node_modules` attribute, you can simply add the target specified there to the `data` or `deps` attribute of the rule instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nor\n\n    ts_library(\n        name = \"lib\",\n        srcs = glob([\"*.ts\"]),\n        tsconfig = \":tsconfig.json\",\n        deps = [\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"],\n    )\n\nWe also dropped support for filegroup based node_modules target and removed `node_modules_filegroup` from `index.bzl`.\n\nIf you are using this feature for user-managed deps, you must now a `js_library` target\nwith `external_npm_package` set to `True` instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    js_library(\n        name = \"node_modules\",\n        srcs = glob(\n            include = [\n                \"node_modules/**/*.js\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.d.ts\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.json\",\n                \"node_modules/.bin/*\",\n            ],\n            exclude = [\n    ### Files under test & docs may contain file names that\n    ### are not legal Bazel labels (e.g.,\n    ### node_modules/ecstatic/test/public/中文/檔案.html)\n                \"node_modules/**/test/**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/docs/**\",\n    ### Files with spaces in the name are not legal Bazel labels\n                \"node_modules/**/* */**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/* *\",\n            ],\n        ),\n    ### Provide ExternalNpmPackageInfo which is used by downstream rules\n    ### that use these npm dependencies\n        external_npm_package = True,\n    )\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \":node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nSee `examples/user_managed_deps` for a working example of user-managed npm dependencies.\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n**Note**: this is likely the last 2.x release of rules_nodejs, we expect 3.0.0 next week.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        sha256 = \"b3521b29c7cb0c47a1a735cce7e7e811a4f80d8e3720cf3a1b624533e4bb7cb6\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/2.3.2/rules_nodejs-2.3.2.tar.gz\"],\n    )\n\nand update your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to `latest`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** add DeclarationInfo sources from dependencies as inputs to npm_package_bin driven actions ([#&#8203;2353](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2353)) ([85dc132](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/85dc132))\n-   **builtin:** give better error when linker runs on Node &lt;10 ([c344401](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c344401)), closes [#&#8203;2304](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2304)\n-   **examples:** fix jest example on windows ([cc04f6c](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cc04f6c)), closes [#&#8203;1454](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1454)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow running NPM tools from execroot ([#&#8203;2297](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2297))

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;300-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare300-rc1300-2020-12-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.2...3.0.0)\n\n> ### For a full list for the breaking changes in 3.0.0 and other notes on migrating, see the [Migrating to 3.0.0 wiki](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30) page.\n>\n> ##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** only pass kwargs to the test, not the .update binary ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2361)) ([afa095b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/afa095b))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **builtin:** remove node_modules attribute from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & ts_library ([c2927af](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c2927af))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **builtin:** We removed the node_modules attribute from `nodejs_binary`, `nodejs_test`, `jasmine_node_test` & `ts_library`.\n\nIf you are using the `node_modules` attribute, you can simply add the target specified there to the `data` or `deps` attribute of the rule instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nor\n\n    ts_library(\n        name = \"lib\",\n        srcs = glob([\"*.ts\"]),\n        tsconfig = \":tsconfig.json\",\n        deps = [\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"],\n    )\n\nWe also dropped support for filegroup based node_modules target and removed `node_modules_filegroup` from `index.bzl`.\n\nIf you are using this feature for user-managed deps, you must now a `js_library` target\nwith `external_npm_package` set to `True` instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    js_library(\n        name = \"node_modules\",\n        srcs = glob(\n            include = [\n                \"node_modules/**/*.js\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.d.ts\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.json\",\n                \"node_modules/.bin/*\",\n            ],\n            exclude = [\n    ### Files under test & docs may contain file names that\n    ### are not legal Bazel labels (e.g.,\n    ### node_modules/ecstatic/test/public/中文/檔案.html)\n                \"node_modules/**/test/**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/docs/**\",\n    ### Files with spaces in the name are not legal Bazel labels\n                \"node_modules/**/* */**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/* *\",\n            ],\n        ),\n    ### Provide ExternalNpmPackageInfo which is used by downstream rules\n    ### that use these npm dependencies\n        external_npm_package = True,\n    )\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \":node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nSee `examples/user_managed_deps` for a working example of user-managed npm dependencies.\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n**Note**: this is likely the last 2.x release of rules_nodejs, we expect 3.0.0 next week.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        sha256 = \"b3521b29c7cb0c47a1a735cce7e7e811a4f80d8e3720cf3a1b624533e4bb7cb6\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/2.3.2/rules_nodejs-2.3.2.tar.gz\"],\n    )\n\nand update your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to `latest`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** add DeclarationInfo sources from dependencies as inputs to npm_package_bin driven actions ([#&#8203;2353](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2353)) ([85dc132](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/85dc132))\n-   **builtin:** give better error when linker runs on Node &lt;10 ([c344401](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c344401)), closes [#&#8203;2304](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2304)\n-   **examples:** fix jest example on windows ([cc04f6c](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cc04f6c)), closes [#&#8203;1454](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1454)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow running NPM tools from execroot ([#&#8203;2297](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2297)) ([364ac89](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/364ac89))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains</summary>\n\n###

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;300-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare300-rc1300-2020-12-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.2...3.0.0)\n\n> ### For a full list for the breaking changes in 3.0.0 and other notes on migrating, see the [Migrating to 3.0.0 wiki](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30) page.\n>\n> ##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** only pass kwargs to the test, not the .update binary ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2361)) ([afa095b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/afa095b))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **builtin:** remove node_modules attribute from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & ts_library ([c2927af](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c2927af))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **builtin:** We removed the node_modules attribute from `nodejs_binary`, `nodejs_test`, `jasmine_node_test` & `ts_library`.\n\nIf you are using the `node_modules` attribute, you can simply add the target specified there to the `data` or `deps` attribute of the rule instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nor\n\n    ts_library(\n        name = \"lib\",\n        srcs = glob([\"*.ts\"]),\n        tsconfig = \":tsconfig.json\",\n        deps = [\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"],\n    )\n\nWe also dropped support for filegroup based node_modules target and removed `node_modules_filegroup` from `index.bzl`.\n\nIf you are using this feature for user-managed deps, you must now a `js_library` target\nwith `external_npm_package` set to `True` instead.\n\nFor example,\n\n    js_library(\n        name = \"node_modules\",\n        srcs = glob(\n            include = [\n                \"node_modules/**/*.js\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.d.ts\",\n                \"node_modules/**/*.json\",\n                \"node_modules/.bin/*\",\n            ],\n            exclude = [\n    ### Files under test & docs may contain file names that\n    ### are not legal Bazel labels (e.g.,\n    ### node_modules/ecstatic/test/public/中文/檔案.html)\n                \"node_modules/**/test/**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/docs/**\",\n    ### Files with spaces in the name are not legal Bazel labels\n                \"node_modules/**/* */**\",\n                \"node_modules/**/* *\",\n            ],\n        ),\n    ### Provide ExternalNpmPackageInfo which is used by downstream rules\n    ### that use these npm dependencies\n        external_npm_package = True,\n    )\n\n    nodejs_test(\n        name = \"test\",\n        data = [\n            \"test.js\",\n            \":node_modules\",\n        ],\n        entry_point = \"test.js\",\n    )\n\nSee `examples/user_managed_deps` for a working example of user-managed npm dependencies.\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n**Note**: this is likely the last 2.x release of rules_nodejs, we expect 3.0.0 next week.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        sha256 = \"b3521b29c7cb0c47a1a735cce7e7e811a4f80d8e3720cf3a1b624533e4bb7cb6\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/2.3.2/rules_nodejs-2.3.2.tar.gz\"],\n    )\n\nand update your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to `latest`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** add DeclarationInfo sources from dependencies as inputs to npm_package_bin driven actions ([#&#8203;2353](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2353)) ([85dc132](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/85dc132))\n-   **builtin:** give better error when linker runs on Node &lt;10 ([c344401](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c344401)), closes [#&#8203;2304](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2304)\n-   **examples:** fix jest example on windows ([cc04f6c](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cc04f6c)), closes [#&#8203;1454](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1454)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow running NPM tools from execroot ([#&#8203;2297](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2297)) ([364ac89](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/364ac89))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains</summary>\n\n###

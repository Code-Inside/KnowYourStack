It's not the end of the world, but it's yet something more that the dev has to add to its cauldron of `utilities.tsx` and remember to use.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think it'd be very convenient to provide 2 more Observables: `value$` and `status$`, which always replay the latest value of the control to the subscribers.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.value$.pipe(map(...));\r\n\r\ncanSubmit$ = this.form.status$.pipe(map(...));\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing getters:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nget fullName() {\r\n  const { name, surname } = this.form.value;\r\n  return name + ' ' + surname;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is not reactive programming and it has several drawbacks, such as:\r\n- Worse performance\r\n- No async flows, debouncing / throttling is hard, no flattening operator capabilities...\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47739","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request for AbstractControl.value$ and AbstractControl.status$ Observables\" (#47739)"},{"Id":"1403866520","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-11T20:46:59","Actor":"atcastle","Number":"47727","RawContent":null,"Title":"[draft] Add 'fill mode' to NgOptimizedImage","State":"closed","Body":"This PR creates a new boolean attribute on the ngOptimizedImage directive called `fill`, which allows the directive to be used without height and width, and which automatically styles the image to fill it's containing element.\r\n\r\nThis PR still requires some additional test cases before merging.

As a replacement for `true`, you can use \"compat\"\n    -   Emitted assets no longer have an `isAsset` flag in the bundle\n    -   Rollup will no longer fix assets added directly to the bundle by adding the `type: \"asset\"` field\n-   Some features that were previously marked for deprecation now show warnings when used ([#&#8203;4552](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4552)):\n    -   Some options have been deprecated:\n        -   `inlineDynamicImports` as part of the input options: use `output. inlineDynamicImports`\n        -   `manualChunks` as part of the input options: use ` output. manualChunks  `\n        -   `maxParallelFileReads`: use \\`maxParallelFileOps\n        -   `output.preferConst`: use `output.generatedCode.constBindings`\n        -   `output.dynamicImportFunction`: use the `renderDynamicImport` plugin hook\n        -   `output.namespaceToStringTag`: use `output.generatedCode.symbols`\n        -   `preserveModules` as part of the input options: use ` output. preserveModules  `\n    -   You should no longer access `this.moduleIds` in plugins: use `this.getModuleIds()`\n    -   You should no longer access `this.getModuleInfo(...).hasModuleSideEffects` in plugins: use `this.getModuleInfo(...).moduleSideEffects`\n-   Configuration files are only bundled if either the `--configPlugin` or the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` options are used. The configuration is bundled to an ES module unless the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` option is used. In all other cases, configuration is now loaded using Node's native mechanisms ([#&#8203;4574](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4574) and [#&#8203;4621](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4621))\n-   The properties attached to some errors have been changed so that there are fewer different possible properties with consistent types ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Some errors have been replaced by others (ILLEGAL_NAMESPACE_REASSIGNMENT -> ILLEGAL_REASSIGNMENT, NON_EXISTENT_EXPORT -> MISSING_EXPORT) ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Files in `rollup/dist/*` can only be required using their file extension ([#&#8203;4581](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4581))\n-   The `loadConfigFile` helper now has a named export of the same name instead of a default export ([#&#8203;4581](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4581))\n-   When using the API and sourcemaps, sourcemap comments are contained in the emitted files and sourcemaps are emitted as regular assets ([#&#8203;4605](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4605))\n-   Watch mode no longer uses Node's EventEmitter but a custom implementation that awaits Promises returned from event handlers ([#&#8203;4609](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4609))\n-   Assets may only be deduplicated with previously emitted assets if their source is a `string` ([#&#8203;4644](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4644))\n-   By default, Rollup will keep external dynamic imports as `import(…)` in commonjs output unless `output.dynamicImportInCjs` is set to false ([#&#8203;4647](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4647))\n\n##### Changes to Rollup Options\n\n-   As functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk, they should be careful to avoid performance-heavy operations ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   `entryFileNames/chunkFileNames` functions now longer have access to the rendered module information via `modules`, only to a list of included `moduleIds` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The path of a module is no longer prepended to the corresponding chunk when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   When preserving modules, the `[name]` placeholder (as well as the `chunkInfo.name` property when using a function) now includes the relative path of the chunk as well as optionally the file extension if the extension is not one of `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `[ext]`, `[extName]` and `[assetExtName]` placeholders are no longer supported when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `perf` option no longer collects timings for the asynchronous part of plugin hooks as the readings were wildly inaccurate and very misleading, and timings are adapted to the new hashing algorithm ([#&#8203;4566](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4566))\n-   Change the default value of `makeAbsoluteExternalsRelative` to \"ifRelativeSource\" so that absolute external imports will no longer become relative imports in the output, while relative external imports will still be renormalized ([#&#8203;4567](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4567))\n-   Change the default for `output.generatedCode.reservedNamesAsProps` to no longer quote properties like `default` by default ([#&#8203;4568](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4568))\n-   Change the default for `preserveEntrySignatures` to \"exports-only\" so that by default, empty facades for entry chunks are no longer created ([#&#8203;4576](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4576))\n-   Change the default for `output.interop` to \"default\" to better align with NodeJS interop ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Change the default for `output.esModule` to \"if-default-prop\", which only adds \\__esModule when the default export would be a property ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Change the default for `output.systemNullSetters` to `true`, which requires at least SystemJS 6.3.3 ([#&#8203;4649](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4649))\n\n##### Plugin API Changes\n\n-   Plugins that add/change/remove imports or exports in `renderChunk` should make sure to update `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` accordingly ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The order of plugin hooks when generating output has changed ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Chunk information passed to `renderChunk` now contains names with hash placeholders instead of final names, which will be replaced when used in the returned code or `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543) and [#&#8203;4631](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4631))\n-   Hooks defined in output plugins will now run after hooks defined in input plugins (used to be the other way around) ([#&#8203;3846](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3846))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk with some chunk information ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Plugins can access the entire chunk graph via an additional parameter in `renderChunk` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Chunk hashes only depend on the actual content of the chunk and are otherwise stable against things like renamed/moved source files or changed module resolution order ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The length of generated file hashes can be customized both globally and per-chunk ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   When preserving modules, the regular `entryFileNames` logic is used and the path is included in the `[name]` property. This finally gives full control over file names when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   `output.entryFileNames` now also supports the `[hash]` placeholder when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `perf` option will now collect (synchronous) timings for all plugin hooks, not just a small selection ([#&#8203;4566](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4566))\n-   All errors thrown by Rollup have `name: RollupError` now to make clearer that those are custom error types ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Error properties that reference modules (such as id and ids) will now always contain the full ids. Only the error message will use shortened ids ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Errors that are thrown in response to other errors (e.g. parse errors thrown by acorn) will now use the standardized cause property to reference the original error ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   If sourcemaps are enabled, files will contain the appropriate sourcemap comment in `generateBundle` and sourcemap files are available as regular assets ([#&#8203;4605](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4605))\n-   Returning a Promise from an event handler attached to a RollupWatcher instance will make Rollup wait for the Promise to resolve ([#&#8203;4609](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4609))\n-   There is a new value \"compat\" for output.interop that is similar to \"auto\" but uses duck-typing to determine if there is a default export ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   There is a new value \"if-default-prop\" for esModule that only adds an `__esModule` marker to the bundle if there is a default export that is rendered as a property ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Rollup can statically resolve checks for `foo[Symbol.toStringTag]` to \"Module\" if foo is a namespace ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   There is a new CLI option `--bundleConfigAsCjs` which will force the configuration to be bundled to CommonJS ([#&#8203;4621](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4621))\n-   Import assertions for external imports that are present in the input files will be retained in ESM output ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Rollup will warn when a module is imported with conflicting import assertions ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Plugins can add, remove or change import assertions when resolving ids ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   The `output.externalImportAssertions` option allows to turn off emission of import assertions ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Use `output.dynamicImportInCjs` to control if dynamic imports are emitted as `import(…)` or wrapped `require(…)` when generating commonjs output ([#&#8203;4647](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4647))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Chunk hashes take changes in `renderChunk`, e.g. minification, into account ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Hashes of referenced assets are properly reflected in the chunk hash ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   No longer warn about implicitly using default export mode to not tempt users to switch to named export mode and break Node compatibility ([#&#8203;4624](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4624))\n-   Avoid performance issues when emitting thousands of assets ([#&#8203;4644](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4644))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3846](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3846): \\[v3.0] Run output plugins last

I've tried the alternative proposed by documentation, which is to use `freshness` strategy, but as SW will not differentiate valide opaque response and error, it will cache error and introduce unexpected behavior when offline. Also opaque response have negative impact on the estimation usage of the Storage API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47729","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature: Ability to force cors mode for some asset/data groups in service worker\" (#47729)"},{"Id":"1404176064","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-11T07:58:16","Actor":"kukjevov","Number":"47728","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature: Add/Attach directive to dynamically created component (to component host)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when I am creating component dynamically, using `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` (or same works for `createComponent` function) i have no option how to add/attach directive to newly created component.\r\n\r\nI case that i have list of dynamic components (various components) rendered, all implements same interface it would be awesome to have option to dynamically add/attach `Directive` to host element of component.\r\n\r\nThis would add ability to creator of dynamic component to manage which directives are attached to which dynamic component instance.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nExtend *options* for  `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` (also for `createComponent` function) with array of \"Type<AnyDirective>\" which would create also instances of specified directives on component host with all life cycle stuff.\r\n\r\nLet say `createComponent<C>(componentType: Type<C>, options?: { index?: number; injector?: Injector; ngModuleRef?: NgModuleRef<unknown>; environmentInjector?: EnvironmentInjector | NgModuleRef<unknown>; projectableNodes?: Node[][]; directives?: Type<unknown>[]; }): ComponentRef<C>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nOr some other way how to attach directive to dynamic component dynamically.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47728","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature: Add/Attach directive to dynamically created component (to component host)\" (#47728)"},{"Id":"1403856611","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-11T00:56:09","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"47726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"fix(compiler): update element schema\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 3c45f6f33e7a20c460d95203a562e0c056d3dbf7.\r\n\r\nIt causes breakages in google.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47726","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"fix(compiler): update element schema\"\" (#47726)"},{"Id":"1403797162","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-10T23:05:50","Actor":"dsnoeijer","Number":"47725","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix linter errors for accessibility.md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

(There is potentially a call initiated by the service worker but it's not relevant here).\r\n\r\nIn the service worker console we see 2 things: \r\n- Warning: The FetchEvent for \"https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-devops\" resulted in a network error response: the promise was rejected.\r\n- Error: Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Unexpected internal error.\r\n\r\nI tried to debug a bit and the issue seems coming from the _sync_ method on those lines: \r\n`await Promise.all([\r\n          table.write(\"manifests\", manifests),\r\n          table.write(\"assignments\", assignments),\r\n          table.write(\"latest\", latest)\r\n        ]);`\r\n\r\nIf I surround it with a try/catch and a log I still see the error occuring sometimes but it's perflecty smooth for the user (no chrome error page).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/service-worker-devops is having the issue.

The workarounds for which are non-trivial.\r\n\r\nIntercepting the constructor call is useful for:\r\n\r\n- Saving a reference to the class instance\r\n- Obtaining a reference to the node/module injector via `inject`\r\n- Running initialization logic when the class is created\r\n\r\nLibrary authors in the Angular ecosystem are currently limited to using private Angular APIs to work around this, against the advice of Angular team. \r\n\r\nA few examples in the wild:\r\n- [Microwave](https://github.com/jscutlery/devkit/blob/6e29efd2ca34336c21b5a3088dd35df8baeec6c8/packages/microwave/src/lib/shared/decorator.ts#L165)\r\n- [NGXS](https://github.com/ngxs/store/blob/050bc58ab5481cafdeb5cfdc365b4e58515e48ee/packages/store/internals/src/decorator-injector-adapter.ts) (was reverted in later versions due to conflicts)\r\n- [My own project](https://github.com/antischematic/angular-state-library/blob/de2a4ce2f777260076ff61450831fea2eb93eac5/projects/core/src/core.ts#L105)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAngular should recognize valid use cases for meta-programming and provide a public API for library authors to use. All solutions here are intended to work within existing AOT compilation constraints.\r\n\r\n**Solution 1: add a ngOnCreate lifecycle hook**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(instance, injector) {\r\n  // run initialization logic\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  ngOnCreate() {\r\n    setup(this, inject(INJECTOR))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ngOnCreate` hook would run directly after invoking the injected class constructor. It runs in the same injection context as the constructor making it possible to use `inject`. Decorators can then attach this hook to the prototype.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2: add `useFactory` metadata**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup() {\r\n  const injector = inject(INJECTOR)\r\n  const instance = new AppComponent()\r\n  // run initialization logic\r\n  return instance\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  useFactory: setup\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis aligns with `Injectable`, allowing us to override the component factory.\r\n\r\n**Solution 3: add features metadata**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(componentDef) {\r\n  const { factory } = componentDef;\r\n\r\n  componentDef.factory = (type) => {\r\n    const instance = factory(type);\r\n    const injector = inject(INJECTOR);\r\n\r\n    // run initialization logic\r\n\r\n    return instance;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  features: [setup]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake the compiled class definition a public API that can be modified at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n**Alternative 1: Override the class factory**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction CustomDecorator() {\r\n  return function (target) {\r\n    const factory = target['ɵfac']\r\n    target['ɵfac'] = function (...args) {\r\n      const injector = inject(INJECTOR)\r\n      const instance = factory(...args)\r\n      return instance \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@CustomDecorator()\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe approach is to decorate the `ɵfac` property which is a private Angular API. This needs special handling to account for different behaviours in JIT and AOT compilation modes.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 2: Access the constructor with a base class**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent extends BaseComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this isn't ideal since the base constructor is called before all properties have initialized.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 3: Explicitly pass in initialization logic through the constructor**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(instance, injector) {\r\n  // decorator initialization logic\r\n}\r\n\r\n@CustomDecorator()\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    // class initialization logic\r\n    setup(this, inject(INJECTOR))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this defeats the purpose. It also requires consumers to place the call at the end of the constructor after all other initialization is done. Decorators should be self-contained.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 4: Don't use decorators**\r\n\r\n🙁","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide a way to obtain the injector outside a class constructor for meta-programming\" (#47713)"},{"Id":"1402076159","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-08T22:14:18","Actor":"Jakob-em","Number":"47710","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): take serialization into account for empty check of transfer state","State":"open","Body":"Transfer states with no keys and only serialization callbacks were previously treated as empty which lead to no script getting embedded to transfer the state from the server to the client.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there is anything in the docs that needs to be updated.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

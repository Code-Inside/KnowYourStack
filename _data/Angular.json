It tests a \"delete\" component method, which should show a confirmation dialog allowing the user to confirm or abort the delete action. The test expects the `delete()` service method not to have been called, if the user declines the delete action:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nit('should request confirmation before deleting & abort action if user declined', fakeAsync(() => {\r\n    spyOn(appService, 'confirm').and.returnValue(of(false));\r\n    spyOn(personService, 'delete').and.callThrough();\r\n    component.deleteEntry(testPerson);\r\n    //tick(); // Missing tick()!\r\n    expect(personService.delete).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`confirm()` returns an `Observable` that emitts `true`/`false` depending on the user's decision. A spy on `confirm()` will simulate the user declining the action (`of(false)`). As you can see in the code above `tick()` is commented out - let's assume the test dev simply forgot it.\r\n\r\nOf course our expectation will now always be fulfilled. The Observable provided by `confirm()` won't emit anything, since the microtask is pending at the time `expect()` is called.\r\n\r\nHowever, I expected `fakeAsync()` to throw an exception as the [docs say](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/fakeAsync):\r\n\r\n> If there are any pending timers at the end of the function, an exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the component function I'm testing:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeleteEntry(person: Person) {\r\n  this.appService.confirm().toPromise().then(\r\n    (value) => {\r\n      // Bug here: \"!\" operator is missing before \"value\":\r\n      if (value) {\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n      return this.personService.delete(person).toPromise();\r\n    }\r\n  ).catch((e) => {\r\n    console.error(e);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test is crucial. It would be a big problem, if entities are deleted, just because the developer forgot a \"!\". Actually, this is why we write tests.\r\n\r\nAlso see my [reproducing project on stackblitz](https://angular-cnmubr.stackblitz.io). Notice that you have to click the 'refresh'-button of the inner browser view (next to the editor) if you want to re-run the test or after you changed something.

I start troubleshooting it using F12 developer tools in windows 10. Used both networks and performance tab in the debug tools and noticed XMLHttpRequest (networks) & globalZoneAwareCallBack (performance) are the main tasks that takes about 25 seconds to finish.\r\n\r\n![ie-11-win-10-cors-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6003742/40015600-bf02e284-5768-11e8-9c76-a18ff34def70.png)\r\n\r\n![ie-11-win-10-performance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6003742/40010409-7ffd1488-5759-11e8-9298-f3c6cb6ca35b.jpeg)\r\n\r\nAs you can tell from the screenshot, the OPTIONS request are taking so long to finish. My understanding is IE and other browsers send these CORS preflight before the actual request. Most browsers will process the response in 300-500 ms but for some reason IE 11 in windows 10 takes about 24 seconds. Hovering over the timing tab, it indicate the majority of the time is being used for \"downloading\" (the step after TTFB), which is weird since successful response for OPTIONS request usually is 204 with `No Content`. \r\n\r\nI tried this again, but this time I used IE 11 in windows 8.1 instead. This time, IE 11 took around 6s for each and the result was `aborted` instead of 204. Also noticed there were some errors (SEC7118 & SEC7119) in console logs, which according to MS website [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/samples/dn423949(v=vs.85)) are removed from IE 11 from windows 10:\r\n\r\n>This requires the server to return an \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header in its response headers, but one was not returned.\r\n\r\n>The specific operation of the request required both CORS support and preflighting on the server side, but preflighting failed.\r\n\r\nThese raise the question if the api is supporting CORS or not and the answer is yes. Also other browsers finish the OPTIONS request successfully. Not sure why IE  11 is acting different in two version of windows. I assume this is IE 11 related and out of the scope for this issue, so I moved on and troubleshoot using the performance tab.\r\n\r\nIn performance tab, there is DOM event that is taking about 22 seconds and once I expand it i noticed globalZoneAwareCallBack event listener. Unfortunately I don't see any call stack under `Javascript call stack`, so I am not sure where the globalZoneAwareCallBack is struggling.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is any correlation between XMLHttpRequest and globalZoneAwareCallBack here. The XMLHttpRequest OPTIONS request takes about 25 seconds while the globalZoneAwareCallBack takes about 22 + few second tasks before that. I wonder if any of these OPTIONS request is blocking the globalZoneAwareCallBack tasks or vice versa.\r\n\r\nI am not sure this could be a bug related to zonejs but noticed some other issues that was related #691, #971 and both of them are closed now.

Let's call this application `tenant` and the library `shared-lib`.\r\nA component in the `tenant` wants to import a stylesheet of a component from `shared-lib`. This particular stylesheet imports a CSS like so:\r\n```\r\n@import 'colors'; // the lib's ng-package.json styleIncludePaths is already configured.\r\n```\r\nThis will compile just fine in the library.\r\n\r\nNow there is a component in `tenant` that wants to import this particular stylesheet.\r\nThis used to work before by doing this:\r\n\r\n1. Import the stylesheet explicitly,  in `projects/tenant/components/tenant-util.component.ts`\r\n```\r\n  styleUrls: [\r\n    '../../../../shared-lib/src/lib/components/util.component.scss',\r\n    './tenant-util.component.scss'\r\n  ]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2. Configure `stylePreprocessorOptions` in the `tenant` project settings.\r\n```\r\n\"projects\": {\r\n    \"tenant\": {\r\n           ...\r\n           \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n              \"includePaths\": [\r\n                \"projects/shared-lib/src/lib/stylesheets\"\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nClone this repo: https://github.com/jonathanlie/angular-demo\r\n\r\n1. To demonstrate the working version, inside the cloned repo:\r\n```\r\ngit checkout angular-cli-8.0.3\r\nnpm install\r\nng build shared-lib\r\nng serve --aot tenant\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

regression?\r\n@angular/cli<8.1.0 are good, so I think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using angular with laravel, so I can not directly use ng serve to test my site, but after I upgrade angular to 8.1.0, I found that `ng build --watch` can not work, before the upgrade, it's fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nsteps to reproduction:\r\n- cd `webroot folder`\r\n- ng new test-app\r\n- npm add -D holderjs\r\n- add `\"node_modules/holderjs/holder.min.js\"` to angular.json's `scripts` part\r\n- change `base` tag in `index.html` to something like `/test-app/dist/test-app/`, and it must be the correct folder\r\n- ng build --watch\r\n- open url like `https://localhost/test-app/dist/test-app` then, you will find that holderjs can not be loaded, because, there is no window object exists when running the `holder.min.js`\r\n\r\nbut if I use ng serve, then holderjs will NOT throw any error. this only happens when I'm using `--watch`\r\n\r\n## 🌍

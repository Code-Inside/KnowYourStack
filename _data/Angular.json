QA creates or DELETES random data during testing, hence contaminating the production database\r\n\r\nAs you can see it opens up the possibility of connecting production database to staging environments because the developer trusts that ng build will not blindly build production, especially since it has always been the case that you needed --prod.\r\n\r\nI get that many users forgot to use --prod, hence this solution was implemented, but it can be dangerous to production apps. I strongly recommend we revert this change and resort to printing out glaringly obvious console messages if user forgets to use --prod.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nDon't build production by default on ng build.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22618","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng build SHOULD NOT use prod environment by default.

Status:\nFound 1 outside collaborators with push access.\nThis policy requires all users with this access to be members of the organisation. That way you can easily audit who has access to your repo, and if an account is compromised it can quickly be denied access to organization resources. To fix this you should either remove the user from repository-based access, or add them to the organization. \n\n* Remove the user from the repository-based access. From the main page of the repository, go to Settings -> Manage Access. \n(For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository)\n\nOR\n\n* Invite the user to join your organisation.

-->\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 11\r\n\r\nWe could reproduce the issue with Angular 12 and Angular 13 as well, with different — faulty — outcomes.\r\n\r\nOn Angular 12, the issue affected both the `main.js` and `polyfill.js` output files in the distribution build. Based on our initial testing, in Angular 13 the issue only affects the `scripts.js` file in the distribution build.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt seems that some output files' file name hashes are generated incorrectly, when building with output hashing (e.g. `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`). This can cause issues e.g. for Angular applications served from CDNs, where only changed files are uploaded, and the files are diff’d based on their revhash in the filename.\r\n\r\nIn our concrete case (Angular 13, having `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`), when changing the TypeScript target version from `es2017` to any of `es2019`, `es2020`, or `es2021` in the project’s `tsconfig.json`, then rebuilding the project, the file name hash of the generated output file containing global scripts (in our case, the file is named per the default configuration `scripts.js`) does not change, **even though the contents of the `scripts.js` generated output file itself changes.**\r\n\r\n**The expected behaviour is that the revhash generated into any output file’s filename should change if (and only if) the final contents of the output file changes.**\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Clone [https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction](https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction).\r\n2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.\r\n3. Run `ng build --configuration=production` (with the default `es2017` target in `tsconfig.json`).\r\n4. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_1}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch(c){}`.\r\n5. Change the `compilerOptions.target` to `es2019` (or `es2020` or `es2021`) from `es2017` in `tsconfig.json`.\r\n6. Run `ng build --configuration=production`.\r\n7. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_2}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch{}` (different from the output from step 4).\r\n8. Observe that `revhash_1` equals `revhash_2`.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.4\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nIt’s a long shot and we’re not sure whether it’s even connected, but we’ve found that hashing for the scripts doesn’t use `contenthash`, which might be relevant: \r\n\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Output files' filename hashes are incorrect\" (#22602)"},{"Id":"1117538554","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T15:34:18","Actor":"fischeversenker","Number":"22600","RawContent":null,"Title":"Defaults are not applied when using $refs in json schema","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] `ng generate` / `schematics`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI don't know, sorry.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI noticed that the `schematics` CLI is applying defaults in a schema differently, depending on whether a property is defined \"inline\" or defined in a reference using `$ref`. This applies to both `ng generate` and `schematics`.\r\n\r\nAssume this schema for a schematic:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\r\n  \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n    \"Reference\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"inlineProperty\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"referencedProperty\": {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Reference\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"type\": \"object\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a schematic that uses this schema is called without any arguments, the `options` object that it receives looks like this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, that it does not contain the `referencedProperty`, even though it uses the same exact schema - only it's referencing it. If the contents of the reference are copied into the `referencedProperty`, then the same default-logic is applied to it and the `options` object turns into this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false, referencedProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the `schematics` schema validation to apply the same logic for defaults, regardless of whether properties are defined \"inline\" or as a reference.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI provided a minimal setup in [this repository](https://github.com/fischeversenker/angular-schematics-defaults-bug).

mangling with `--mangle-props=` ([#&#8203;218](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/218))\n\n    ⚠️ **Using this feature can break your code in subtle ways.** Do not use this feature unless you know what you are doing, and you know exactly how it will affect both your code and all of your dependencies. ⚠️\n\n    This release introduces property name mangling, which is similar to an existing feature from the popular [UglifyJS](github.com/mishoo/uglifyjs) and [Terser](github.com/terser/terser) JavaScript minifiers. This setting lets you pass a regular expression to esbuild to tell esbuild to automatically rename all properties that match this regular expression. It's useful when you want to minify certain property names in your code either to make the generated code smaller or to somewhat obfuscate your code's intent.\n\n    Here's an example that uses the regular expression `_$` to mangle all properties ending in an underscore, such as `foo_`:\n\n        $ echo 'console.log({ foo_: 0 }.foo_)' | esbuild --mangle-props=_$\n        console.log({ a: 0 }.a);\n\n    Only mangling properties that end in an underscore is a reasonable heuristic because normal JS code doesn't typically contain identifiers like that. Browser APIs also don't use this naming convention so this also avoids conflicts with browser APIs. If you want to avoid mangling names such as [`__defineGetter__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/\\__defineGetter\\_\\_) you could consider using a more complex regular expression such as `[^_]_$` (i.e. must end in a non-underscore followed by an underscore).\n\n    This is a separate setting instead of being part of the minify setting because it's an unsafe transformation that does not work on arbitrary JavaScript code. It only works if the provided regular expression matches all of the properties that you want mangled and does not match any of the properties that you don't want mangled. It also only works if you do not under any circumstances reference a property name to be mangled as a string. For example, it means you can't use `Object.defineProperty(obj, 'prop', ...)` or `obj['prop']` with a mangled property. Specifically the following syntax constructs are the only ones eligible for property mangling:\n\n    | Syntax                          | Example                 |\n    |---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n    | Dot property access             | `x.foo_`                |\n    | Dot optional chain              | `x?.foo_`               |\n    | Object properties               | `x = { foo_: y }`       |\n    | Object methods                  | `x = { foo_() {} }`     |\n    | Class fields                    | `class x { foo_ = y }`  |\n    | Class methods                   | `class x { foo_() {} }` |\n    | Object destructuring binding    | `let { foo_: x } = y`   |\n    | Object destructuring assignment | `({ foo_: x } = y)`     |\n    | JSX element names               | `<X.foo_></X.foo_>`     |\n    | JSX attribute names             | `<X foo_={y} />`        |\n\n    You can avoid property mangling for an individual property by quoting it as a string. However, you must consistently use quotes or no quotes for a given property everywhere for this to work. For example, `print({ foo_: 0 }.foo_)` will be mangled into `print({ a: 0 }.a)` while `print({ 'foo_': 0 }['foo_'])` will not be mangled.\n\n    When using this feature, keep in mind that property names are only consistently mangled within a single esbuild API call but not across esbuild API calls. Each esbuild API call does an independent property mangling operation so output files generated by two different API calls may mangle the same property to two different names, which could cause the resulting code to behave incorrectly.\n\n    If you would like to exclude certain properties from mangling, you can reserve them with the `--reserve-props=` setting. For example, this uses the regular expression `^__.*__$` to reserve all properties that start and end with two underscores, such as `__foo__`:\n\n        $ echo 'console.log({ __foo__: 0 }.__foo__)' | esbuild --mangle-props=_$\n        console.log({ a: 0 }.a);\n\n        $ echo 'console.log({ __foo__: 0 }.__foo__)' | esbuild --mangle-props=_$ \"--reserve-props=^__.*__$\"\n        console.log({ __foo__: 0 }.__foo__);\n\n-   Mark esbuild as supporting node v12+ ([#&#8203;1970](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1970))\n\n    Someone requested that esbuild populate the `engines.node` field in `package.json`. This release adds the following to each `package.json` file that esbuild publishes:\n\n    ```json\n    \"engines\": {\n      \"node\": \">=12\"\n    },\n    ```\n\n    This was chosen because it's the oldest version of node that's currently still receiving support from the node team, and so is the oldest version of node that esbuild supports: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/.\n\n-   Remove error recovery for invalid `//` comments in CSS ([#&#8203;1965](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1965))\n\n    Previously esbuild treated `//` as a comment in CSS and generated a warning, even though comments in CSS use `/* ... */` instead. This allowed you to run esbuild on CSS intended for certain CSS preprocessors that support single-line comments.\n\n    However, some people are changing from another build tool to esbuild and have a code base that relies on `//` being preserved even though it's nonsense CSS and causes the entire surrounding rule to be discarded by the browser. Presumably this nonsense CSS ended up there at some point due to an incorrectly-configured build pipeline and the site now relies on that entire rule being discarded. If esbuild interprets `//` as a comment, it could cause the rule to no longer be discarded or even cause something else to happen.\n\n    With this release, esbuild no longer treats `//` as a comment in CSS. It still warns about it but now passes it through unmodified.

To be accessible, it is required that the `mat-hint` continues to persist somehow. Currently, the `mat-hint` element is fully removed from the DOM: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/form-field/form-field.html#L83\r\n\r\nThis has been brought up on SO several times:\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60185384/keep-the-displaying-of-both-error-and-hint-if-error\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47166694/angular-material-input-with-hint-text-and-error-text-at-the-same-time\r\n\r\nTo compensate, on each project we:\r\n\r\n1. Write a wrapper component around `MatLabel`, `MatHint`, and `MatError`, as well as `MatInput`, `MatSelect`, `MatCheckbox`, etc, duplicating all of their inputs, or\r\n2. Write a wrapper component around `MatLabel`, `MatHint`, and `MatError`, using content projection for the form controls, which breaks the synchronization between all the elements.\r\n\r\nEither way, we spend a lot of time on ugly hacks with which we are always ultimately unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nI propose we hide `mat-hint` with CSS (e.g. `display: none`) instead of fully removing it from the DOM. This will allow users to easily continue to persist `mat-hint` as they see fit, simply by overriding the CSS.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively, or in addition, we could add e.g. `@Input('persistHint')` to `mat-form-field`, but this would require more of a reworking of `mat-form-field`'s logic, and would also require making some design decisions about how `mat-hint` should look when displayed alongside errors, for which the Material guidelines don't give instruction AFAIK.)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24319","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-form-field): Option to allow MatHint to persist alongside MatError\" (#24319)"},{"Id":"1118822726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-31T01:13:13","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"24318","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" (UTC).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

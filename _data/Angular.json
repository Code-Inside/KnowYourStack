This option currently controls the emit of NgModule selector scope information. This emitted information is only needed in AOT mode when an application also uses JIT. However, AOT mode combined with JIT mode is not currently supported nor will work in the Angular CLI. With the Angular CLI, JIT mode is only supported if the entire application is built in JIT mode. Without this option, the CLI needs to manually perform a code transform to remove the information and also replicate TypeScript's import eliding. This is can be a complicated operation and must be continually kept up to date with any changes to both the Angular compiler and TypeScript.

The situation described below is most likely to be encountered when migrating from Observables to Signals, and can lead to confusion.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Sample Code\r\n\r\nHere is a simple enough `computed`. \r\n\r\nIt uses `toSignal` **inside** the `computed`, but let's assume the user is new to Signals and [doesn't know they shouldn't do that.](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50106).\r\n\r\n    // guaranteed synchronous observables\r\n    const store = {\r\n      first$: of('Simon'),\r\n      last$: of('Weaver')\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // simple computed (inside injection context)\r\n    const fullName = computed(() => \r\n    {\r\n        const first = toSignal(store.first$, { requireSync: true });\r\n        const last = toSignal(store.last$, { requireSync: true });\r\n\r\n        return first() + ' ' + last();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    console.log('full name ', fullName());\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\nThe above code reports two errors, the first of which is incorrect and misleading.\r\n\r\n> Error: NG0601: `toSignal()` called with `requireSync` but `Observable` did not emit synchronously.\r\n> Error: NG0600: Writing to signals is not allowed in a `computed` or an `effect` by default. Use `allowSignalWrites` in the `CreateEffectOptions` to enable this inside effects.\r\n\r\nIt turns out the first error is a side effect of the second error (despite being printed out first). If you only notice the first error (and personally I like to put breakpoints inside the vendor code where they are raised!) then you will be misled.\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nAngular error  NG0601 is triggered when an Observable does not emit synchronously when calling `toSignal`.\r\n\r\n      NG0601 `toSignal()` called with `requireSync` but `Observable` did not emit synchronously.\r\n\r\nThis [works internally by subscribing to the observable](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/25153e94f60f7be055d472ab573f4e367f53cbe8/packages/core/rxjs-interop/src/to_signal.ts#L179) and checking immediately to see if the corresponding signal has been assigned a value.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/25153e94f60f7be055d472ab573f4e367f53cbe8/packages/core/rxjs-interop/src/to_signal.ts#L179-L184\r\n\r\nThis sets a signal (which begins as `StateKind.NoValue`) to the synchronous value of the observable, which can then be checked if `requireSync == true`.\r\n\r\nHowever since ALL writes to signals in `computed` and `effect` are forbidden this signal cannot be set, therefore it remains in `StateKind.NoValue` state, thus triggering the erroneous message:\r\n\r\n      NG0601 `toSignal()` called with `requireSync` but `Observable` did not emit synchronously.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\n\r\nThis could easily be solved by introducing a boolean to track the synchronous emission instead of relying on the state of the internal `toSignal` signal:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const syncValue = false;   // NEW\r\n\r\n  const sub = source.subscribe({\r\n    next: value => { syncValue = true; state.set({kind: StateKind.Value, value}); },\r\n    error: error => { syncValue = true; state.set({kind: StateKind.Error, error}); },\r\n    // Completion of the Observable is meaningless to the signal. Signals don't have a concept of\r\n    // \"complete\".\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  if (ngDevMode && options?.requireSync && !syncValue) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeError(\r\n        RuntimeErrorCode.REQUIRE_SYNC_WITHOUT_SYNC_EMIT,\r\n        '`toSignal()` called with `requireSync` but `Observable` did not emit synchronously.');\r\n  }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51027","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Error NG0601 is reported incorrectly (triggered by NG0600) when calling toSignal inside a computed or effect \" (#51027)"},{"Id":"1801658645","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-12T19:56:17","Actor":"e-oz","Number":"51025","RawContent":null,"Title":"@Input and @Output bound to the same signal can produce an error","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nPlease take a look at this: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-srfuv9?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-srfuv9?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 16.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51025","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@Input and @Output bound to the same signal can produce an error\" (#51025)"},{"Id":"1801542471","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-12T18:28:39","Actor":"architect254","Number":"51024","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): http-server-communication typo fix","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I will try to explain as best I can what is happening and where the breaking points may be so that you may investigate further.\r\n\r\nContext: There are two components: **ParentComponent**, with irrelevant content, containing a **NestedDropdownComponent** which receives as input a list of _Items_ from the **ParentComponent**.\r\n\r\n**ParentComponent** gets a list of _fields_ from the backend, but for the **NestedDropdownComponent** to work, these _fields_ need to be mapped to _items_, which is done through an injected mapper service, called simply **MapperService**.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways this can be done:\r\n\r\n`1)`\r\n**ParentComponent.ts**\r\n\r\n`ngOnInit() {`\r\n`this.fields$ = getFieldsAsObservable();`\r\n`this.fields$.subscribe(fields => this.items = mapperService.map(fields));`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n**ParentComponent.html**\r\n\r\n`<tk-nested-dropdown [items] = \"items\"> </tk-nested-dropdown>`\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n`2)`\r\n**ParentComponent.ts**\r\n\r\n`ngOnInit() {`\r\n`this.fields$ = getFieldsAsObservable();`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n**ParentComponent.html**\r\n\r\n`<ng-container *ngIf=\"fields$ | async; let fields\">`\r\n`<tk-nested-dropdown [items] = \"mapperService.map(fields)\"> </tk-nested-dropdown>`\r\n`</ng-container>`\r\n\r\n**In dev environment** (ng served), both implementations work as intended with no issues whatsoever. \r\n\r\n**In prod environment** (ng build), implementation `2)` stops working. When trying to select an item from the `NestedDropdownComponent`, the item is not selectable.\r\n\r\nFrom my investigation, the click event does not register on the element upon inspection, however on click the focus jumps on a \"child\" element simply named comment. \r\n\r\n**Before click**\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/139352684/0bc47fe3-f231-4103-9fc4-10290246094f)\r\n\r\n**After click**\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/139352684/682c8630-1b9e-4d04-894d-fa749978d816)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.0.3\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51020","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inputs on Child Components given as method calls inside templates break in production\" (#51020)"},{"Id":"1801528918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-12T18:18:49","Actor":"architect254","Number":"51023","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): @input getter setter syntax fix","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I use the CMS's SDK to make all requests, as you might expect when working with a third-party software vendor. So this request does not use the angular HTTP client. In some instances, what I've noticed is that sporadically universal will have either waited for this request or skipped it entirely in the rendered HTML.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to mark specific Promises/HTTP requests as required for the page to bootstrap correctly? As I understand wrapping a third-party libraries request in a macrotask is no longer an option. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nDocumentation around this topic / Some method of wrapping such an essential promise from a third-party library that will force Universal to wait for the result of the HTTP request before rendering its HTML.\r\n\r\n### Ideal Solution\r\n\r\nPotentially some lifecycle hook or other service that allows me to say, \"When you've hit this point you're allowed to respond to the request with what you have\"\r\n\r\n### What have I tried so far\r\n\r\nI've tried, moving it between the service and the bootstrapping component, loading with observables, promises and anything that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nHalf a solution to my problem would be chucking the theme object into some KV and passing it in through the provider's section of the bootstrapping process, but that does not help requests that are requesting things like \"page content\"\r\n\r\nThe only other solution I can think of would be to implement some KV cache that any request by this library (prismicio/client) would have to check before completing, lowering the frequency of this issue occurring but not resolving it.\r\n\r\nI have also tried implementing and tinkering with this snippet here. however, my issue is still occurring.  https://gist.github.com/sparebytes/e2bc438e3cfca7f6687f1d61287f8d72\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Force Universal to wait for component promises to resolve before rendering.\" (#51016)"},{"Id":"1799320974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-11T19:26:21","Actor":"vyom1611","Number":"51009","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): fixed function overloading with createSignalFromFunction that didn't have a matching implementation","State":"closed","Body":"In the original code, extraApi wasn't optional in the function implementation, contradicting the overload signatures.

Here's a minimal example that triggers this edge case:\n\n    ```ts\n    (() => {\n      const enum E { a };\n      () => E.a\n    })\n    ```\n\n-   Allow a newline in the middle of TypeScript `export type` statement ([#&#8203;3225](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3225))\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly rejected the following valid TypeScript code:\n\n    ```ts\n    export type\n    { T };\n\n    export type\n    * as foo from 'bar';\n    ```\n\n    Code that uses a newline after `export type` is now allowed starting with this release.\n\n-   Fix cross-module inlining of string enums ([#&#8203;3210](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3210))\n\n    A refactoring typo in version 0.18.9 accidentally introduced a regression with cross-module inlining of string enums when combined with computed property accesses. This regression has been fixed.\n\n-   Rewrite `.js` to `.ts` inside packages with `exports` ([#&#8203;3201](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3201))\n\n    Packages with the `exports` field are supposed to disable node's path resolution behavior that allows you to import a file with a different extension than the one in the source code (for example, importing `foo/bar` to get `foo/bar.js`). And TypeScript has behavior where you can import a non-existent `.js` file and you will get the `.ts` file instead. Previously the presence of the `exports` field caused esbuild to disable all extension manipulation stuff which included both node's implicit file extension searching and TypeScript's file extension swapping. However, TypeScript appears to always apply file extension swapping even in this case. So with this release, esbuild will now rewrite `.js` to `.ts` even inside packages with `exports`.\n\n-   Fix a redirect edge case in esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;3208](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3208))\n\n    The development server canonicalizes directory URLs by adding a trailing slash. For example, visiting `/about` redirects to `/about/` if `/about/index.html` would be served. However, if the requested path begins with two slashes, then the redirect incorrectly turned into a protocol-relative URL. For example, visiting `//about` redirected to `//about/` which the browser turns into `http://about/`. This release fixes the bug by canonicalizing the URL path when doing this redirect.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.26`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#8426)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.25...8.4.26)\n\n-   Fixed clone methods types.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Unfortunately, the Sass compiler does not provided the importer file to import plugins. Previously to workaround this issue, all previously resolved stylesheets were tried as the importer path. This allowed the stylesheets to be resolved but it also could cause a potentially large increase in build time due to the amount of previous stylesheets that would need to be tried. To avoid the performance impact and to also provide more accurate information regarding the importer file, a lexer is now used to extract import information for a stylesheet and inject the importer file path into the specifier. This information is then extracted from the import specifier during the Sass resolution process and allows the underlying package resolution access to a viable location to resolve the package for all package managers.

This is a working example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/pghvre-qtk1t6?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-theming-example.html\r\n2. This is the link with the same example, but as standalone component: https://stackblitz.com/edit/pghvre-sczu3y?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo matter if I use `standalone: true` or an `NgModule` based setup the result should be the same. The padding that is applied to the form field should shrink like it does when using it with `NgModule`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIn the standalone version, different classes are generated which don't render the correct resizing:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/2816893/29696e84-00f6-4a5a-9c11-3697d143d718)\r\n\r\nFor comparison, this is what the element looks like if `NgModule` is used:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/2816893/750c0e68-bced-4339-9459-cfecb414fbb2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome and Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27452","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatFormFieldModule): Resize not working when using in standalone\" (#27452)"},{"Id":"1802853736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-13T18:30:28","Actor":"pierophp","Number":"27448","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(MatDialog): Implement hide/show methods","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThis feature was previously discussed on #5162.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution was to use the addPanelClass method to hide the dialog. But it doesn't work if you are using a backdrop. I built a [demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest%2Ftest.component.ts) to show the problem ([TestDialog01Component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest-dialog-01%2Ftest-dialog-01.component.ts)).  There is no way to get the current overlay of the dialog to dispose of it manually  (See #15840).\r\n\r\nI could find a workaround ([TestDialog02Component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest-dialog-02%2Ftest-dialog-02.component.ts)) by not using the built-in backdrop and creating a custom overlay. But it feels too hacky.\r\n\r\nThe MdDIalog should have a built-in hide/show method or expose the overlayRef. \r\n\r\nIf the team accepts it, I could implement it and send a PR.\n\n### Use Case\n\nI think in at least two use cases:\r\n\r\n- An expensive operation to render the dialog.\r\n- Using [Optimistic UI](https://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05) to hide the modal as soon as the user clicks the button, but it needs to run some async operations that depend on each other, so you cannot destroy the modal until all the operations are complete (my use case).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27448","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(MatDialog): Implement hide/show methods\" (#27448)"},{"Id":"1802548183","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-13T15:37:41","Actor":"elenachiosa","Number":"27445","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Slider): Rounded thumb label text value, inconsistent with actual value","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n14.2.7\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRounded thumb label text value, inconsistent with actual value.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: Not needed.

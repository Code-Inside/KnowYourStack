An empty array does not fail the validation and passes instead.\n\nSome issues [inconsistency between \"classic\" and signal forms validators regarding empty arrays](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65424) seem to suggest, that this is the expected behavior, which is not what the docs suggest.\n\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/forms/signals/validation#required)\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI was searching how to use the required validator in a signal form with a tag box that has an array of string values as model.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nI was testing a signal form with a tag box widget having an array of string values as form model.

For example, a component with selector `svg.some-class` is created in the correct namespace (see `namespaceURI`):\n\n<img width=\"471\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b0f6872-139d-4ad1-bbb6-54c6d1699cd2\" />\n\nHowever, any child `path`, `g`, etc are not created in the correct namespace when done using `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` (see `namespaceURI`):\n\n<img width=\"471\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985779f6-2d6a-43f1-be4d-1ccd7eaa7b1e\" />\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAs I see it, the neatest solution would be either to:\n\n1) allow `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` to accept a `hostElement` parameter, just as `createComponent` does, or\n2) make `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` accept a `nameSpace` parameter, or\n3) allow a `nameSpace` field in the `@Component` decorator.\n\nI would by far prefer 1, as this would allow dynamic selection of the component's host node. This would extend beyond this case - for example, a button component can be attached to either an `a` or `button` element dynamically.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66893","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enhance `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` to cater for SVG elements and beyond\" (#66893)"},{"Id":"3890321678","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-03T20:31:37","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"66883","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): extract call signature return type.","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #66799\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66883","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): extract call signature return type.\" (#66883)"},{"Id":"3889227199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-03T20:26:06","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"66879","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (21.1.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiIyMS4xLngiLCJsYWJlbHMiOlsiYWN0aW9uOiBtZXJnZSIsImFyZWE6IGJ1aWxkICYgY2kiLCJ0YXJnZXQ6IGF1dG9tYXRpb24iXX0=-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66879","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance (21.1.x)\" (#66879)"},{"Id":"3889575871","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-03T20:25:44","Actor":"mo-navabix","Number":"66880","RawContent":null,"Title":"Footer overlaps main content and sidebar navigation","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nThe site footer is currently rendering on top of the page content rather than following the natural document flow.

Like:\n\n```\nreadonly model = computed(() => <returns zod-object>)\n\nreadonly form = form(this.model, (schemaPath) => {\n   validateStandardSchema(schemaPath, () => this.model())\n// or\n   validateStandardSchema(schemaPath, () => this.model)\n})\n````\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRunning the validateStandardSchema in an effect, or try to run any function on the form in the oninit, to recalculate the validation rules.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for signals with validateStandardSchema\" (#66867)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3894073206","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T01:40:47","Actor":"edumserrano","Number":"32420","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/build-angular is tied to a bugged version of Webpack (v5.104.1)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe `@angular-devkit/build-angular` is tied to [version v5.104.1 of webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b33678e53e74a432ecd40b2ecc9599accdf53c47/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/package.json#L58C5-L58C26) which contains a bug that prevents an Angular app from being used in combination with Webpack Module Federation.\n\nThe related bug reports in webpack are:\n\n- webpack/webpack#20332\n- webpack/webpack#20380\n- webpack/webpack#20405\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nA reproduction repo can be found in the webpack/webpack#20405 issue.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI       : 21.1.2\nAngular           : 21.1.2\nNode.js           : 24.13.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.8.0\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                       │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular-devkit/build-angular │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.1           │\n│ @angular/build                │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.1           │\n│ @angular/cli                  │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.1           │\n│ @angular/common               │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler             │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli         │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/core                 │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/forms                │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser     │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/router               │ 21.1.2            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ rxjs                          │ 7.8.2             │ ~7.8.0            │\n│ typescript                    │ 5.9.3             │ ~5.9.2            │\n│ vitest                        │ 4.0.18            │ ^4.0.8            │\n└───────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis is not a bug with the Angular CLI but I also didn't think it was a feature request so I was unsure how to report this.\n\nWhat I'd like to request is for a new version of the Angular CLI to be pushed which updates the webpack dependency to the version that is not bugged: `v5.105.0`.\n\nAs a workaround, after creating an Angular app with `ng new` I can override the webpack version in the package.json with:\n\n```\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"webpack\": \"5.105.0\"\n  },\n```\n\nBut it would be good if the non-bugged version of webpack was available by default after doing `ng new`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32420","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular is tied to a bugged version of Webpack (v5.104.1)\" (#32420)"},{"Id":"3893800663","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T00:41:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32419","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): remove unnecessary source-map-support polyfill for Vitest browser coverage","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the injection of the source-map-support library in the Vitest builder.

Install Node.js (tested with Node 24 and Node 22)\n2. Uninstall Angular CLI globally:\n```bash\nnpm uninstall -g @angular/cli\n```\n3. Clear npm cache:\n```bash\nnpm cache verify\n```\n4. Install latest Angular CLI globally:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @angular/cli@latest\n```\n5. Run ng v for version check\n```bash\nng version\n```\n\n----\n### Actual Result\nRunning ng version from a normal command prompt shows old Angular CLI version:\n```yaml\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n```\n\nHowever, running the same command from npm global directory works correctly:\n```bash\ncd C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\nng version\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n```yaml\n> cd \"C:\\<username>\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\"\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm>ng v\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI       : 21.1.2\nNode.js           : 22.22.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 9.7.2\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n```\n\n### Observations\n\n- `where ng` outputs:\n```yaml\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\ng\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\ng.cmd\n```\n- `npm` binaries exist in: `C:\\Program Files\\nodejs` and `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm`\n- `ng` binary exist in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm` \n- The CLI version used depends on the current working directory, which is unexpected behavior.\n- Manually copying ng / ng.cmd (C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm -> C:\\Users\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm) or @angular directories (C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules -> C:\\Users\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules) does not resolve the issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nAfter installing the latest Angular CLI globally, running ng from any directory should consistently use the latest installed version.\n\n### Additional Context (Multiple Users Affected)\n\nThis issue does not appear to be isolated. Multiple users have reported very similar behavior on Windows.\n\nFor example, the following Medium post describes the same issue with Angular CLI versions not updating globally and behaving inconsistently depending on execution path:\n\n- https://medium.com/@divyanshchauhan28/how-i-solved-a-confusing-updating-angular-version-issue-9a4af977d31a\n\nThis suggests a broader issue related to **Windows PATH resolution, npm global binaries, or Node.js upgrades,** rather than a one-off local setup problem.\n\n### Request\n- Please let us know if this is a known Angular CLI issue or an npm / Node.js / Windows PATH-related problem.\n- If this issue belongs in another repository (Node.js, npm, or Windows), kindly suggest the correct place to report it.\n- Any official guidance or recommended workaround would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRequest\n- Please let us know if this is a known Angular CLI issue or an npm / Node.js / Windows PATH-related problem.\n- If this issue belongs in another repository (Node.js, npm, or Windows), kindly suggest the correct place to report it.\n- Any official guidance or recommended workaround would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n\n\ngetting Angular version undefined issue\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32403","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI global update not reflected on Windows unless executed from npm global directory\" (#32403)"},{"Id":"3884151020","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:52:09","Actor":"jgtestw","Number":"32405","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content Security Policy and SPAs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently CSP and SPAs don't work well together.\n\nThere is however something very simple we could do to make CSP 100% compatible with SPA.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWhen Angular builds the app, also output a file called hashes.json.

Comment the `mat-slide-toggle` line in the template.\n2. The `label` element is displayed (it is just a mock empty `label` element to illustrate the point).\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nStyles affecting generic elements (not owned by Angular Material, such as `label`) should not \"leak\" into the global styles.\n\nProbably a solution would be to prefix that selector with `.mat-mdc-slide-toggle`, like:\n\n```css\n.mat-mdc-slide-toggle label:empty {\n   display: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAll empty `label` elements are being affected right now by the aforementioned change.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.1.2\n- CDK/Material: 21.1.2 \n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): linux x64\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32736","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-slide-toggle): do not leak component styles to global styles (\"label:empty\" selector)\" (#32736)"},{"Id":"3885847688","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T17:51:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32733","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix up event naming in Aria","State":"closed","Body":"Some Aria directives were using outputs prefixed with `on` which is explicitly called out as a anti-pattern in the styleguide (see https://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs#choosing-event-names).\r\n\r\nFixes #32727.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32733","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix up event naming in Aria\" (#32733)"},{"Id":"3872710241","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T17:51:17","Actor":"nivekh","Number":"32727","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Menu): Aria Menu has an output prefixed with \"on\", discouraged elsewhere","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs#choosing-event-names\n> Avoid prefixing output names with \"on\".\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/aria/menu/Menu\n> onSelect\n> A callback function triggered when a menu item is selected.\n\nRan into this when `@angular-eslint/no-output-on-prefix` linter rule fired in a component which is forwarding this directive.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/aria/menu/Menu","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32727","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Menu): Aria Menu has an output prefixed with \"on\", discouraged elsewhere\" (#32727)"},{"Id":"3886960775","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T16:49:14","Actor":"csirota97-a11y","Number":"32735","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): Accessibility scan showing Orphaned Form Label failure when correctly using the component","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am using 18.2.14; however, this issue also present on the https://material.angular.dev/components/select/overview page.\n\nWhen using the WAVE accessibility scanner, we see that every mat-select present on the page flags an \"Orphaned Form Label\" accessibility failure.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nREPL: https://material.angular.dev/components/select/examples\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe’ve observed a recurring accessibility issue across several Angular Material components where the keyboard focus indicator relies primarily on a subtle background color change, often without a visible outline or border.\n\nIn many cases, the focus state is indicated only by a light background shade (e.g., light grey or light blue), which is difficult or impossible to perceive, especially:\n\n- For users with low vision\n- For users with color vision deficiencies\n- In bright environments or low-quality displays\n- When components are placed on similar colored backgrounds\n\n**This affects multiple components, including (but not limited to):**\n\n- Buttons\n- Icon buttons\n- List items\n- Menu items\n- Tabs\n- Select options\n- Table rows / interactive rows\n\nWhy this is an accessibility problem\nWCAG 2.4.7 – Focus Visible (Level AA)\nKeyboard focus must be visible.\n\n- In many Angular Material components, the current focus indicator:\n- Has no distinct shape (no outline, border)\n- Is visually indistinguishable from hover or selected states\n- This makes keyboard navigation extremely difficult for users who rely on visible focus.\n\n**From an accessibility testing perspective:**\n\n- Users cannot reliably tell where focus is on the page\n- Screen magnifier users lose orientation\n- Keyboard-only users frequently get “lost” in complex UIs\n- The UI technically supports keyboard, but practically fails usability\n\nThis results in applications built with Angular Material failing accessibility compliance (WCAG) unless we manually override focus styles.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\nWith a distinct visual affordance, such as:\n\n- Outline\n- Border\n\nCurrently we have to implement custom global CSS overrides just to achieve basic focus visibility, which defeats the purpose of a component library that claims accessibility support out of the box.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly backgroing color appears on focus, and this color is very light and very hard to notice by the users with vision impairements. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

[#&#8203;3425](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3425)\n\n### [`v4.31.11`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v4.31.11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v4.31.10...v4.31.11)\n\n- When running a Default Setup workflow with [Actions debugging enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/monitor-workflows/enable-debug-logging), the CodeQL Action will now use more unique names when uploading logs from the Dependabot authentication proxy as workflow artifacts. This ensures that the artifact names do not clash between multiple jobs in a build matrix. [#&#8203;3409](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3409)\n- Improved error handling throughout the CodeQL Action. [#&#8203;3415](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3415)\n- Added experimental support for automatically excluding [generated files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github) from the analysis. This feature is not currently enabled for any analysis. In the future, it may be enabled by default for some GitHub-managed analyses. [#&#8203;3318](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3318)\n- The changelog extracts that are included with releases of the CodeQL Action are now shorter to avoid duplicated information from appearing in Dependabot PRs.

Upgrade to 21.0.0 broke the custom scrolling strategy implementation we have used so we decided to look for alternatives. Luckily, It seems that 21.0 also introduced support for tables with sticky header (or was introduced earlier, I am actually not sure which version added support), unfortunately, version 21.1 seems to introduce a bug which makes the scrolling shift around.\n\nThe bug can be seen in the example provided in the Table documentation as well. The documentation is still running on 21.0.0 but if you upgrade the example to 21.1.1, you can start seeing the buggy behavior when scrolling.\n\nScrolling seems to be fixed when `itemSize` is set to 0, however, in infinite scrolling implementations using DataSource that rely on `collectionViewer.onViewChange` `range.end`, it will continuously fetch the next page since `range.end` will always be the max value (3rd stackblitz link in the reproduction links has an async implementation mocked example that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts` in constructor)\n\nExample provided is on mat-table but cdkTable's behavior is the same if not worse\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nv21.0 (original example on version 21.0): https://stackblitz.com/edit/dfp4dgn5?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 (original example but on version 21.1.1): https://stackblitz.com/edit/6wi4nsxd?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 with DataSource: https://stackblitz.com/edit/gt9emjwr?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts (much more noticeable in this example)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Scroll around using the scroll wheel (also happens when you drag around the scrollbar thumb especially visible in tables with small amount of rows)\n2. 3rd link has an infinite scrolling implementation that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts`'s constructor\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table should scroll correctly without shifting around\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nScrolling shifts around, some cases making it impossible to even scroll back up once you go all the way down and some cases scrolls upwards when scrolling down\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.1.1\n- CDK/Material: 21.1.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows & macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTable & mat-table): virtual scrolling shifting issues introduced in 21.1\" (#32715)"},{"Id":"3862892171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T23:43:21","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32714","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/combobox): fix selection via keyboard by passing proper item","State":"open","Body":"Autocomplete example is broken when using keyboard navigation to select an item, as it appears selected, but then pressing clear does not have an effect.

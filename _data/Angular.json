This is particularly useful when image links are signed and returned by the backend server, rather than being generated on the frontend.\r\n\r\nExample of the predefined srcset:\r\n```\r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/128 128w,  \r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/256 256w,\r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/384 384w\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ngSrcset` does not support a complete srcset with image links, it only supports a comma-separated list of one or more width/density descriptors. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that while I can add `[attr.srcset]` for the image, NgOptimizedImage won't be able to work with it. For instance, if I have an image marked with `priority`, NgOptimizedImage will autogenerate preload link element without `imagesrcset`, basically omitting `[attr.srcset]`. It seems that it generates `imagesrcset` only when `ngSrcset` is used, which prevents the use of NgOptimizedImage with predefined srcset values.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow NgOptimizedImage to work with `[attr.srcset]` or add support for NgOptimizedImage to be able to use predefined srcset within `ngSrcset`.

I feel that putting it upfront rather than a testing assertion is more readable and harder to make a mistake with, but if the implementation of such a method is easier then it is a valid solution to the problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57123","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add an option to disallow concrete root providers to be used in TestBed\" (#57123)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2431441062","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T15:34:56","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28112","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `564fb35` -> `8d0f535` |\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `4c70256` -> `a3fc20d` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a8734f7` -> `e97a231` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f080ad1` -> `9449829` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b8fd05c` -> `2591c3c` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f7ecf85` -> `f7b71e9` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `3f7e786` -> `056cbc4` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `cd8232b` -> `bcda871` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `49a6db3` -> `3cd32a4` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `6bf6715` -> `d481003` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c391424` -> `92169f4` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5618bdd` -> `91d787a` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `f586eeb` -> `816ca00` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f40f1a0` -> `bcb97d7` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ca1ecd2` -> `25949b8` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e4978c2` -> `5df11f1` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `bc7a9b8` -> `a26c52c` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e56fcd9` -> `47f8bcb` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `722ce5b` -> `c41cfb4` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The `create` method seems to register an esbuild `onLoad` handler that will [read the path as a local file](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/048df34ccb7d4ef67b5877e126c74c0db65b879c/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/stylesheet-plugin-factory.ts#L167-L170)\r\n\r\nAny URLs ending in `.less`, `.scss` or `.sass` are also affected.\r\n\r\nIn our case we can't easily remove `.css` from the imported URL, as it's defined by an imported third party CSS file.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with `ng new`\r\n2. Install Tailwind by following the [Tailwind + Angular installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular)\r\n3. Add the following to `src/styles.css`: `@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/earlyaccess/notokufiarabic.css);`\r\n4. Run `npm run build`\r\n5. The build fails, as the URL is attemped to be read as a local file\r\n\r\nWhen no Tailwind config file is present, the build runs fine:\r\n1. Remove `tailwind.config.js` and the `@tailwind` lines from the CSS file, while keeping the `@import url()`\r\n2. Run `npm run build`\r\n3. The build succeeds\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/earlyaccess/notokufiarabic.css' [plugin

But, I'm facing some runtime issues that I'm not really able to flag as \"internal problems\" or \"angular issues\".  \r\n\r\nSo: either I'm doing something really stupid (then sorry for the waste of time) or there is a bug at angular level. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm mostly inclined to think it's an angular issue related to the usage of \"ng-modules\" / \"zone.js\" and the way esbuild is striping the bundle from unnecessary code as soon as `optimization: true` (default). \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I've created a simple angular project ([myws](https://github.com/mauriziocescon/myws/tree/master)) that you can fork and play with. It's a tiny and simplified version of what we're doing in our CI/CD. \r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the process:  \r\n- build an ng-element (with ng-modules / zone.js) as an application, \r\n- concatenate the resulting files in one main.js, \r\n- load such files at runtime. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the repo, the results are the following: \r\n- mf1 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\"`, `\"buildOptimizer\": true`,\r\n- mf2 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": false`,\r\n- mf3 (🚫): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": true`.\r\n\r\nwhere mf1 / mf2 / mf3 have basically the same code. \r\n\r\nThe runtime error for mf3 is not really helpful: \r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 22 59\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/006b6a39-ddad-41d3-ad1d-ab5ae8751e66\">\r\n\r\nLocally, I get different errors for different internal mfs, but I assume the root cause is the same. Some examples: \r\n<img width=\"686\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 27\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b049a8e2-2689-472d-a80a-2d95c2446a81\">\r\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 54\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a7771a-8ffb-4541-a3c2-78757b7e1c42\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope there's enough information to the make the ticket actionable on your side!

This change caused sections in our application to appear more prominent than expected. Additionally, this creates inconsistency in places where we combine custom styles that set the color of outlines by using the `outline-variant` role from the theme, and also have `mat-dividers` within.\r\n\r\nI understand that the change from #28995 is to achieve better color contrast. However, this deviates from the specification, which explains that dividers are decorative elements and have no minimum contrast requirements.\r\n\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/accessibility\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/specs#f7d1605e-1629-404c-86a5-0ef6848ce520\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5161b955-a4ff-4cdc-9d09-d1b1ca807908)\r\n\r\nA potential workaround can be to use the `--mat-divider-color` property and set color to the `outline-variant` token, but it would be nice if there is no need for style changes.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz links: \r\n- Angular Material **18.1.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu?file=package.json\r\n- Angular Material **18.0.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu-iaag8z?file=package.json\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the example using Angular Material 18.1.x. Observe that the dividers take their color from the `outline` token.\r\n2. Open the example using Angular Material 18.0.x.

In this case the initial `status` of the form control changes from `VALID` to `INVALID`, as expected, but no `statusChanges` event is emitted.\n\nThe same behaviour is also present, when setting the form value programatically outside of user interactions, e.g., in life-cycle methods such a `ngOnInit`.\n\nWhen there is, however, a value change triggered by direct user interaction or indirect user interaction, e.g., pressing a button that programmatically sets the form value, the expected status is emitted as `statusChange`.\n\nNote that whenever `statusChanges` are unexpectedly not emitted a corresponding `events` emission is also missing.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-query-aqv6yuzm-vfbygddo?file=package.json,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nException: Form status changes from `VALID` to `INVALID` while emitting a `statusChanges` event.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.10\n@angular/build               19.2.10\n@angular/cli                 19.2.10\n@schematics/angular          19.2.10\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn case this is expected behaviour, it should be mentioned in the documentation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61082","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Directive Validators Not Emitting StatusChanges\" (#61082)"},{"Id":"3032763861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T23:13:25","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"61081","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: add a script to copy cdk api files to adev","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61081","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: add a script to copy cdk api files to adev\" (#61081)"},{"Id":"3032752995","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T23:05:52","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"61080","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(devtools): fix profiler support with @defer blocks","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this change, the devtools profile logged warnings \"Unable to find parent node for ...\".\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61080","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(devtools): fix profiler support with @defer blocks\" (#61080)"},{"Id":"3032681238","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T22:22:26","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"61079","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: add a new version of the logic node","State":"open","Body":"Adds a new version of logic node that is created via builders.

The resolved promise re-enters the zone in the transition, so that will trigger the Angular zone anyways. If it didn't do that, it risks activated the route outside the zone, which is a bigger risk. Regardless, this function is only run once per navigation, so even if it _did_ result in an extra promise/timeout inside the zone, this is not excessive. Using ZoneJS to trigger rendering is known to overreact to events.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.8...20.0.0-next.9)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   the `TestBed.flushEffects()` was removed - use\n    the `TestBed.tick()` instead.\n-   `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` has several\n    breaking changes:\n    -   It is renamed to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig`\n    -   The behavior applies to *all* checkNoChanges runs\n    -   The `useNgZoneOnStable` option is removed. This wasn't found to be generally\n        more useful than `interval`\n-   afterRender was renamed to afterEveryRender.\n-   This commit deprecates `ng-reflect-*` attributes and updates the runtime to stop producing them by default. Please refactor application and test code to avoid relying on `ng-reflect-*` attributes.\n\n    To enable a more seamless upgrade to v20, we've added the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function (can be imported from the `@angular/core` package), which enables the mode in which Angular would be producing those attribites (in dev mode only). You can add the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function to the list of providers within the bootstrap call.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b7d3f3dbfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/b7d3f3dbfcfc40000ca34087d3b8b42319468177) | feat | Allow passing ScrollOptions to ViewportScroller ([#&#8203;61002](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61002)) |\n| [fc4a56d5c5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/fc4a56d5c5fa270dbb1402c7cafe6d4f2af571eb) | fix | rename httpResource function in factory ([#&#8203;60022](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60022)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c889382a20](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c889382a2044f9a024f475680c8573d0f7112562) | feat | detect missing structural directive imports ([#&#8203;59443](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59443)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d5fd7349fb](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d5fd7349fb8b3942f0727cd7ee62e7a7b231e9e4) | feat | introduce TestBed.tick() ([#&#8203;60993](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60993)) |\n| [e711f99d81](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e711f99d81ea7dbd4526f859c363244fccdf0626) | feat | move `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig` ([#&#8203;60906](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60906)) |\n| [d8fbb909ce](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d8fbb909ce4380c0ea48512cf5d364a2785fd428) | feat | rename afterRender to afterEveryRender and stabilize ([#&#8203;60999](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60999)) |\n| [8d82a39a60](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d82a39a601fbedee58f140a7432c4adf0b054ff) | fix | async EventEmitter error should not prevent stability ([#&#8203;61028](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61028)) |\n| [624be2ef0c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/624be2ef0c7255e62082751cc339d2cd618bd633) | fix | prevent stash listener conflicts ([#&#8203;59635](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59635)) |\n| [c2987d8402](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c2987d8402b7b03333b0081a7f97750cdf612e99) | refactor | stop producing `ng-reflect` attributes by default ([#&#8203;60973](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60973)) |\n\n##### http\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [ccc5cc068f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ccc5cc068f788013c19498c44d13530c1bc98912) | feat | add keepalive support for fetch requests ([#&#8203;60621](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60621)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, it may be fixed inside the mat-select code as well. I am not sure where the fix should happen, as I don't if the same behavior occurs elsewhere or if other side effects could be caused.\n\nI was able to implement a workaround for myself by calling a custom scrolling method whenever the _keyManager emits a value in the `change` observable. The custom method is a copy of the original method `_scrollOptionIntoView` from mat-select which currently looks like this:\n\n```typescript\n  /** Scrolls a particular option into the view. */\n  _scrollOptionIntoView(index: number): void {\n    const option = this.options.toArray()[index];\n\n    if (option) {\n      const panel: HTMLElement = this.panel.nativeElement;\n      const labelCount = _countGroupLabelsBeforeOption(index, this.options, this.optionGroups);\n      const element = option._getHostElement();\n\n      if (index === 0 && labelCount === 1) {\n        // If we've got one group label before the option and we're at the top option,\n        // scroll the list to the top. This is better UX than scrolling the list to the\n        // top of the option, because it allows the user to read the top group's label.\n        panel.scrollTop = 0;\n      } else {\n        panel.scrollTop = _getOptionScrollPosition(\n          element.offsetTop,\n          element.offsetHeight,\n          panel.scrollTop,\n          panel.offsetHeight,\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe fix in my workaround is that it passes `element.offsetTop - panel.offsetTop`  as the `optionOffset` parameter instead of `element.offsetTop` when calling the original method `_getOptionScrollPosition` . \n\n```typescript\npanel.scrollTop = _getOptionScrollPosition(\n          element.offsetTop - panel.offsetTop,\n          element.offsetHeight,\n          panel.scrollTop,\n          panel.offsetHeight,\n        );\n  }\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to official select documentation example \"Select with reset option\" https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-reset\n2. Scroll such that the example mat-select is at the bottom of the page so that the overlay will open towards the top\n3. Open mat-select\n4.

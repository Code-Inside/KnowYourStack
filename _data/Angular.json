This is problematic for a few reasons:\r\n* It makes refactoring hard, because there are circular dependencies. (For example, `FormGroup` extends `AbstractControl`, and `AbstractControl.parent` is `FormGroup|FormArray`, so the classes are permanently coupled together.)\r\n* The code is less tree-shakable, because forms classes refer \"down the tree\". If you want `AbstractControl`, you get the symbols for its descendants as well.\r\n* There are several places where `AbstractControl` accepts `FormGroup|FormArray`, which is non-extensible. Abstracting this away will allow better support for custom `AbstractControl` implementations.\r\n\r\nIn this change, I add a new abstract class to the hierarchy. `AbstractControlCollection` is an `AbstractControl` that contains other form controls inside, and `FormArray` and `FormGroup` extend this new class. This untangles the circular dependency, and solves the above issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45218","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(forms): Introduce an `AbstractControlCollection` superclass.\" (#45218)"},{"Id":"1157545715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-02T18:27:14","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"45242","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v13.2.5 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"13.2.x\" branch to the next branch (master).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45242","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v13.2.5 release\" (#45242)"},{"Id":"1157538291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-02T18:18:07","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"45241","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v13.2.5\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45241","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v13.2.5\" with changelog.\" (#45241)"},{"Id":"1157496049","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-02T17:35:32","Actor":"atscott","Number":"45240","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): Remove special logic for hybrid apps","State":"open","Body":"This commit removes special (undocumented) logic in the Router code that is\r\nmeant to prevent duplicate navigations that result from location syncs in\r\nAngularJS/Angular hybrid applications.\r\n\r\nThe duplicate navigations can occur when both the Router and the AngularJS sync\r\ncode detect a location change via a popstate/hashchange event. When this\r\nhappens, the Angular Router schedules a navigation to sync itself with\r\nthe browser, but the hybrid listener may also schedule an additional\r\nnavigation. There are a few reasons this logic should not be included in\r\nthe Router:\r\n\r\n* This special logic is not tree shakeable so it introduces a bundle\r\n  size cost for all applications, most of which don't need it.\r\n* There have been many updates to the routing pipeline to tolerate\r\n  duplicate navigations. That is, duplicate navigations can happen and\r\n  routing should still complete successfully.\r\n    * https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/0e8548f667e5fdefa3ac7cdf1ba47e3e17011ffc\r\n    * https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/9e039ca68bfae5328f3fc1f16fabd7673c466a25\r\n* The logic is really in the wrong place: The hybrid sync code should be\r\n  the location to handle this. If duplicate navigations are meant to be\r\n  avoided, the hybrid sync code should have handling to _not_ trigger\r\n  duplicate navs.\r\n* This logic _also_ used to exist because the mock location\r\n  helper used for test incorrectly triggered popstate events during\r\n  router navigations. In order to avoid unexpected behavior in tests, this\r\n  logic needed to be added. This incorrect mocking may also have been\r\n  put in place because the upgrade module _would_ see a location change\r\n  event and trigger a duplicate navigation.  The location mock has since been updated to\r\n  match real browser behavior so this is no longer necessary. The\r\n  upgrade module has also been updated to not trigger duplicate\r\n  navigations.  The following commits are related to this:\r\n    * https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/202a1a56314af4ddb99c476f974536a10e390319\r\n    * https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/c6a93001eb74374b0fbc6aea1286fe1183d21382\r\n\r\nSide note: The `setTimeout` in the location change listener is used to\r\nensure the ordering of duplicate navigations was consistent. You can see\r\nthat the logic being removed here expects the imperative navigation to precede the\r\npopstate/hashchange. With the removal of this code, the `setTimeout` no\r\nlonger serves a purpose. However, it has been found that tests can rely\r\non this behavior (incorrectly) because they expect the navigation to be\r\ncomplete but in reality, it hasn't even started because the test has not\r\nflushed the timeout. Removing the timeout would be a breaking change as\r\na result.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45240","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): Remove special logic for hybrid

This is problematic when you want to import an ES Module in your custom schematics, [for example `HtmlParser` from `@angular/compiler`](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/7a1672a83224a5a2f3e6b3d08de3e461514120ea/projects/schematics/src/shared/utils/file-utils.ts#L253) (which since ng13 is shipped only as ESM).\r\n\r\n#### Problems with not supporting ESM:\r\n\r\nThe following error started to occur for our custom schematics in runtime, since we upgraded from ng12 to 13:\r\n`require() of ES Module <path-to-the-repo>/node_modules/@angular/compiler/fesm2015/compiler.mjs not supported. Instead change the require of <path-to-the-repo>/node_modules/@angular/compiler/fesm2015/compiler.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.`\r\n\r\nBut the advised change of the static `@angular/compiler` to a dynamic import is cumbersome due to various reasons:\r\n- it unnecessarily changes the our synchronous code to asynchronous code\r\n- it induces passing down the `compilerModule` (result of `await import(@angular/compiler)`) as an argument down to all helper functions ([example in angular repo](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a432ad65c77d5888da49b630d5055da2b8f7513c/packages/core/schematics/migrations/router-link-empty-expression/index.ts#L61))\r\n- it requires a hacky workaround ticking the Typescript compiler so to avoid compiling the dynamic `import()` into the `require()` call  - for more see [the workaround function `loadEsmModule()` in angular repo ](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e0015d3c456d584242269b0765878d598a550888/packages/core/schematics/utils/load_esm.ts#L11-L35). Btw. this function is not exported in public API, so we need to copy-paste it to our repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nSupport executing ESM schematics .\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nChange the import of ESM to dynamic imports in our schematics code and deal with all its cumbersome consequences (described above).

[`v14.0.0-next.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next5-2022-03-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.4...14.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### router\n\n-   The type of `Route.pathMatch` is now more strict. Places that use\n    `pathMatch` will likely need to be updated to have an explicit\n    `Route`/`Routes` type so that TypeScript does not infer the type as\n    `string`.\n\n-   Previously, resolvers were waiting to be completed\n    before proceeding with the navigation and the Router would take the last\n    value emitted from the resolver.\n    The router now takes only the first emitted value by the resolvers\n    and then proceeds with navigation. This is now consistent with `Observables`\n    returned by other guards: only the first value is used.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7671a1e40d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7671a1e40d0f2abe1cb7e9d84d5ac47a5adb546a) | fix | canceled JSONP requests won't throw console error with missing callback function ([#&#8203;36807](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/36807)) |\n| [05d50b849b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/05d50b849bb891c37c3eefab81a45099057dfd78) | perf | make `NgLocalization` token tree-shakable ([#&#8203;45118](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45118)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [69018c9f42](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/69018c9f42d14c1c7aa8271b406d6d247de1c564) | feat | allow for injector to be specified when creating an embedded view ([#&#8203;45156](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45156)) |\n| [c5df474c7c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c5df474c7c744305c9412090b5e19bb6d4f7128d) | fix | remove individual commands for updating gold files ([#&#8203;45198](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45198)) |\n| [88f1168506](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/88f1168506befd0665125da1fca2a719cb27dbb5) | perf | only track LViews that are referenced in **ngContext** ([#&#8203;45172](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45172)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7ee121f595](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7ee121f595a47338b31098ae51a6f91d80c8fdce) | feat | Add untyped versions of the model classes for use in migration.

Now it only accepts `Observable<Tree>`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/37a06a7c37f5b4286d58b475e6e12c86f00fac5b/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/engine/interface.ts#L234-L237\r\n\r\nThe current problem with `Rule` accepting only `Observable<Tree>` it that it accepts only the `Observable` from rxjs of a fixed version `6.6.7` (at the moment of writing) which is hardcoded in `dependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c2737dd51ab68a538a317fc0d7a377032d346b53/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/package.json#L20\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I'm writing custom schematics in my repo, while having any slightly different version of `rxjs` installed, e.g. `6.6.3`, then I get an error about incompatible variants of the interface `Subscriber` - between my installed version in `node_modules` and the fixed version from `node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs` (which is derived from the interface `Rule`)\r\n\r\nExample of custom schematics for minimal reproduction:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Rule, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\nimport { of } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nexport function migrate(): Rule {\r\n  return (tree: Tree) => {\r\n    return of(tree);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message in detail:\r\n```\r\n(parameter) _context: SchematicContext\r\nType '(tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'Rule'.\r\n  Type 'Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'void | Rule | Tree | Observable<Tree> | Promise<void | Rule>'.\r\n    Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>'.\r\n      The types of 'source.operator.call' are incompatible between these types.\r\n        Type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic' is not assignable to type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic'.\r\n          Types of parameters 'subscriber' and 'subscriber' are incompatible.\r\n            Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>'.\r\n              Property 'isStopped' is protected but type 'Subscriber<T>' is not a class derived from 'Subscriber<T>'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- expose `Promise<Tree>` as a return type of `Rule`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- workaround on my side: return `Promise<Rule | void>` instead of `Promise<Tree>`\r\n- workaround on Angular's side: move `rxjs` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics` and relax the version to `^6.6.0` (but still.. what if somebody is using rxjs7 in their repo?)\r\n- I'm opened to your other suggested ideas or workarounds","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22783","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`Rule` from `@angular-devkit/schematics` should accept return type `Promise<Tree>`\" (#22783)"},{"Id":"1153249501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T14:11:21","Actor":"eng-dibo","Number":"22776","RawContent":null,"Title":"[@angular-devkit/build-angular] Cannot convert undefined or null to object","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

(even if my package.json requires v^7.4.0)\r\n\r\nthis makes the following line typely wrong if used inside an angular project (probably you may need to use a function or extend a class that uses rxjs.Observable from v7.4.0, but your root node_modules has rxjs v6.6.7)\r\n```\r\nimport { Observable} from 'rxjs';\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservable from both versions (i.e 6.6.7 and 7.4.0) are not compatible because there are many [breaking changes](https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary) between those versions, for example, `_isScalar` is removed from Observable at v7.0.0\r\n\r\n> the property _isScalar is missing in Observable\r\n\r\nthis specially happens in monorepos, where the angular project is a workspace inside that monorepo and there is another workspace that extends its functionality.\r\nin this case, the package managers may choose to install rxjs@6.6.7 in the root dir, and rxjs@7.4.0 inside the package's node_module dir.\r\n\r\n**my suggestion** is to update dependencies in @angular-devkit packages to remove that breaking changes between rxjs versions\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

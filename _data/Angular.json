However, when we need to validate that a value does NOT match a pattern, developers have to write negated regular expressions (e.g., using negative lookahead or inverse character classes).\n\nThis approach has several drawbacks:\n- Writing negated regex patterns is complex and error-prone\n- Negated patterns can be significantly less performant, especially for complex patterns\n- The intention of the code becomes less clear and harder to maintain\n- Some patterns are extremely difficult or impossible to negate correctly using regex alone\n\n\nExample of current workaround:\n```typescript\nValidators.pattern(/^(?!.*badword).+$/) // Prevents 'badword' from appearing anywhere\n```\n\n____\n\nI can submit a PR if there's interest in this feature. Is the proposed naming suitable?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a new validator Validators.patternNot() that validates that a form control value does NOT match the given pattern.\n```typescript\n// Proposed API\nValidators.patternNot(pattern: string | RegExp): ValidatorFn\n\n// Usage example\nformControl = new FormControl('', [\n  Validators.patternNot(/badword/), // Fails if 'badword' is found\n]);\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- More intuitive API for negative pattern validation\n- Better performance as it doesn't require complex negated regex\n- Clearer code intention\n- Easier to maintain and understand\n- Consistent with existing Angular validators naming convention (?)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Keep using negated patterns with existing Validators.pattern()\n- Custom validator function (Each team would need to implement their own solution)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Angular Form Validator \"patterNot\" that validates that a specific pattern DOES NOT match\" (#59927)"},{"Id":"2844240209","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:46:55","Actor":"Bobokhuja","Number":"59911","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix tabs in example code in creating injectable services","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Without making any changes, click Menu from the toolbar to navigate away.\n5. Run Garbage Collection (GC) and take another Heap Snapshot.\n    - Expected: No detached elements, and memory is restored to the initial state.\n6. Repeat Step 3, but this time modify some form fields before navigating away.\n7.

`application`/`browser-esbuild` builders, contains a potentially breaking change for some development setups. Examples of such setups include those that use reverse proxies or custom host names during development. The change within a patch release was made by Vite to address a security vulnerability. For projects that directly access the development server via `localhost`, no changes should be needed. However, some development setups may now need to adjust the `allowedHosts` development server option. This option can include an array of host names that are allowed to communicate with the development server. The option sets the corresponding Vite option within the Angular CLI. For more information on the option and its specific behavior, please see the Vite documentation located here:\r\nhttps://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of the configuration option allowing `example.com`:\r\n```\r\n\"serve\": {\r\n      \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n      \"options\": {\r\n        \"allowedHosts\": [\"example.com\"]\r\n      },\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29602","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): update vite to version 5.4.14\" (#29602)"},{"Id":"2848725783","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T16:10:52","Actor":"Nvveen","Number":"29619","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't resolve SCSS files in karma with \"builderMode\": \"application\"","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsing a codebase with large amounts of older SCSS, code and configurations, I ran into some change detection mishaps in a lot of unittests that have been migrated to use signals.

It's including component styles in `AllCalculator`. For example, on my example application Angular reports that the \"all\" bundle has size 10.627MB when in fact on disk the total size of all javascript and css files is 10.283MB. \n\nI noticed this when calculating stats from `stats.json` locally. If I patch the `AllCalculator`  to ignore assets that are marked as `componentStyle`, then the calculation matches what is on the disk. Those assets are not actually on the disk and their code is already included in other assets.\n\n```diff\n class AllCalculator extends Calculator {\n     calculate() {\n         const size = this.assets\n-            .filter((asset) => !asset.name.endsWith('.map'))\n+            .filter((asset) => !asset.name.endsWith('.map') && !asset.componentStyle)\n             .map((asset) => this.getAssetSize(asset))\n             .reduce((total, size) => total + size, 0);\n         return [{ size, label: 'total' }];\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/523d539c6633ab223723162f425e0ef2b7b4ff71/packages/angular/build/src/utils/bundle-calculator.ts#L241-L250\n\nIt would be also nice if the whole build didn't fail when the budget size goes over `error` threshold. It makes it impossible to update budget values programmatically. :) In Angular 18 & webpack builder, the app was built and there were stats.json even if the budget went over. With Angular 19 & esbuild builder, you don't get the result. :/ \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\ncommand: `ng build --stats-json`\n\nBuilder used: `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application`\n\n###

Then we translate them to Material 3 color palettes with the `var()` function of CSS. The colorpalettes will be the implemented like following:\n\n```SCSS\n:root {\n  --my-selector-0: #000000,\n  ....\n  --my-neutral-0: #000000,\n}\n\n$_palettes: (\n  primary: (\n    0: var(--my-selector-0),\n    10: var(--my-selector-10),\n    20: var(--my-selector-25),\n    25: var(--my-selector-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n  neutral: (\n    0: var(--my-neutral-0),\n    10: var(--my-neutral-10),\n    20: var(--my-neutral-25),\n    25: var(--my-neutral-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n)\n```\n\nBut the `mat.theme` mixin generates transparencies of `neutral-0` which doesn't work, because the is a function which converts the Hex-Color into RGB and then sets the transparency.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a theme with `ng generate @angular/material:theme-color`\n2. Change the `neutral` with hue `0` to a CSS variable which you have defined at root level and set its color to e.g. `#000000`\n3. start the app with\n4. inspect the the `--mat-sys-level` variables\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to insert the transparency RGB colors needed for the `--mat-sys-level1` variables into the `mat.theme` mixin to get working box shadows for e.g. buttons.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInstead of a fancy transparency the `var(--my-neutral-0)` will be shown and the box shadow looks really dark deep and black\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.5\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.3\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theme): mat.theme doesn't support color palettes with CSS variables\" (#30476)"},{"Id":"2848035893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T13:06:44","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30475","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular/dev-infra digest to 8a438a3 - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `515b575` -> `8a438a3` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Developers must manually add conditional logic in their templates to display a \"No records found\" or similar message.\n\nThis feature request proposes adding a `matNoDataNode `directive to <mat-tree>, similar to the `matNoDataRow `directive available for tables. The `matNoDataNode `directive would allow developers to define a template that is displayed when the tree's data source is empty.\n\nProposed Implementation:\n\n- A new directive, `matNoDataNode`, that conditionally renders a template when the tree's data source is empty.\n\n- Seamless integration with the existing mat-tree API, ensuring consistency with other Angular Material components.\n\n### Use Case\n\nhe `matNoDataNode `directive would enable the following use cases:\n\n1. Displaying a \"No Records Found\" Message\n\nWhen a tree has no data, developers can use `matNoDataNode `to display a user-friendly message, such as \"No records found\" or \"No data available.\"\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\">\n  <!-- Regular tree node definitions -->\n  <mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef=\"let node\">\n    {{ node.name }}\n  </mat-tree-node>\n\n  <!-- NoDataNode template -->\n  <ng-template matNoDataNode>\n    <div class=\"no-data-message\">No records found</div>\n  </ng-template>\n</mat-tree>\n```\n\n2. Custom Empty-State Templates\n\nDevelopers can define custom templates for empty states, including icons, buttons, or additional instructions.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<ng-template matNoDataNode>\n  <div class=\"no-data-message\">\n    <mat-icon>info</mat-icon>\n    <p>No data available.

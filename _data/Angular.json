This has two key benefits:\r\n1. The commit history now reflects the actual release (ex. any DevTools commits before the release commit are actually included in that release). Previously the changes in a release were dictated by the release PR branch, which is an ephemeral target. Other PRs may be merged to `main` before the release PR, and those changes would not be included in that DevTools release.\r\n2. We can now compute a changelog based on this more accurate history.\r\n\r\nThe downside to this change is that release PRs are now blocking releases in a way they weren't before (which is likely desirable in the grand scheme of things), meaning we need to be more diligent about merging them in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nI added a short script for listing DevTools commits since the last release, taking advantage of the more accurate commit history. This should make changelog generation a lot easier, even if there's still a manual process of rewriting the commit message into a line item in release notes.\r\n\r\nAlso made a few minor cleanup changes such as escaping the markdown in the suggested reviewer note so it can be more easily copy-pasted from the rendered format of this doc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60646","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): update release process to commit before publishing\" (#60646)"},{"Id":"2961270317","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-31T18:52:44","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"60645","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"[Patch Port] See associated pull request for more information.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following updates:\r\n\r\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `ed42486` -> `1f3caa6` |\r\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `a9c1c54` -> `78f80fa` |","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60645","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[PATCH] build: update cross-repo angular dependencies\" (#60645)"},{"Id":"2961209303","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-31T18:26:25","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"60644","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `ed42486` -> `1f3caa6` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `a9c1c54` -> `78f80fa` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Internally these are translated into Go regular expressions. However, this translation previously ignored the `flags` property of the regular expression. With this release, esbuild will now translate JavaScript regular expression flags into Go regular expression flags. Specifically the JavaScript regular expression `/\\.[jt]sx?$/i` is turned into the Go regular expression `` `(?i)\\.[jt]sx?$` `` internally inside of esbuild's API. This should make it possible to use JavaScript regular expressions with the `i` flag. Note that JavaScript and Go don't support all of the same regular expression features, so this mapping is only approximate.\n\n-   Fix node-specific annotations for string literal export names ([#&#8203;4100](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4100))\n\n    When node instantiates a CommonJS module, it scans the AST to look for names to expose via ESM named exports. This is a heuristic that looks for certain patterns such as `exports.NAME = ...` or `module.exports = { ... }`. This behavior is used by esbuild to \"annotate\" CommonJS code that was converted from ESM with the original ESM export names. For example, when converting the file `export let foo, bar` from ESM to CommonJS, esbuild appends this to the end of the file:\n\n    ```js\n    // Annotate the CommonJS export names for ESM import in node:\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      bar,\n      foo\n    });\n    ```\n\n    However, this feature previously didn't work correctly for export names that are not valid identifiers, which can be constructed using string literal export names. The generated code contained a syntax error. That problem is fixed in this release:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    let foo\n    export { foo as \"foo!\" }\n\n    // Old output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\"\n    });\n\n    // New output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\": null\n    });\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for index source maps ([#&#8203;3439](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3439), [#&#8203;4109](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4109))\n\n    The source map specification has an optional mode called [index source maps](https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-index-source-map) that makes it easier for tools to create an aggregate JavaScript file by concatenating many smaller JavaScript files with source maps, and then generate an aggregate source map by simply providing the original source maps along with some offset information. My understanding is that this is rarely used in practice. I'm only aware of two uses of it in the wild: [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack/).\n\n    This release provides basic support for indexed source maps. However, the implementation has not been tested on a real app (just on very simple test input). If you are using index source maps in a real app, please try this out and report back if anything isn't working for you.\n\n    Note that this is also not a complete implementation. For example, index source maps technically allows nesting source maps to an arbitrary depth, while esbuild's implementation in this release only supports a single level of nesting. It's unclear whether supporting more than one level of nesting is important or not given the lack of available test cases.\n\n    This feature was contributed by

Locally reverting that change fixes the issue and you get the earlier behavior.\n\nThe use case may be little bit unconventional, but we have separate list for \"items to buy\" and then items for being in \"shopping basket\" (using one of the examples in website). They are in different components and connected by one parent component. Everything works greatly until the \"product selection\" component is destroyed. It works when there are sane number of items ,say 500. But when there are over 4000 items, the browser becomes unusable.\n\nI'm able to repro this same behavior in Stackblitz. Though, it needs a lot more items before it starts to break: 40000.\n\nOur actual code is years old, so it may be that it would be instructed to write it another way. \n\nIs there a way that `this._syncItemsWithRef();` would not be called for every item in a row if it happens really quickly? Or is there a better way to disconnect the drop lists before the component is destroyed? Or could there be a setting to opt into the old behavior? \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://1owdqzmq.stackblitz.io\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.  Change array size to be 40 000 for example\n2. Click \"Hide source\" in template\n3. Notice how slow everything becomes\n\nWith smaller array, it's not noticeable at all.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should not be so taxing operation that it basically crashes browser tab\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCrashes browser tab :/ \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.7\n- CDK/Material: ^19.2.0\n- Browser(s): chrome, firefox\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30737","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(drag-and-drop): disconnecting drop list is really slow after version 19.1.5\" (#30737)"},{"Id":"2959804267","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-31T15:55:32","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30751","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(cdk/drag-drop): fix performance regression when destroying items","State":"closed","Body":"#30514 changed the logic that syncs destroyed items to apply to non-dragged items as well.

For example, when I click to collapse parent 1, the structure of the tree view is re-rendered as:\n```\n- parent 1\n\n- parent 2\n   - leaf 2-1\n   - leaf 2-2\n```\n> link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qfnq49si-ubbjqylv?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-tree-flat-children-accessor-example.ts\n\n\n**Extra** 📝\n\n Although I see that the [official demo](https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/examples#cdk-tree-nested-level-accessor) hides nodes that don't need to be displayed by a combination of `style.display` and `shouldRender`.\n\nI think this is still a problem. Because in Demo 1 you have to use `style.display` and `shouldRender` to render correctly, while in Demo 2 you can render correctly without them. \n\nSo I think there is a difference in this behaviour that is problematic.\n\nThe same problem exists for `TreeControl`, but we can pass only specific node data into the tree's `dataStream` based on the treeControl's record of the node's isExpanded status.\n\n**Possible problem location** 🤔\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/538b8bcd6e14044cc3dce87409eeac40f27941cf/src/cdk/tree/tree.ts#L1093-L1103\n\nThe `flattenedNodes` and `renderNodes` are both equal to `nodes`，maybe we should create a method like `shouldRender` that determines which nodes should be rendered and assigns them to `renderNodes`?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nsee **Desciption**\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCorrectly render visible nodes in the tree when expanding or collapsing nodes\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen use `levelAccessor` with flat data, can not render visible nodes in the tree correctly when expanding or collapsing nodes. But use `childrenAccessor` with nested data, correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-tree): cdk tree with levelAccessor only renders all nodes and cant render based on the expanded state\" (#30735)"},{"Id":"2954430359","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-27T21:12:09","Actor":"rileyajones","Number":"30734","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a null check to autocomplete options","State":"open","Body":"If a mat-autocomplete element does not contain any mat-options it will throw a null pointer when it is unloaded.

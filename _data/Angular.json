Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\n    `Injector.get`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Based on the documentation, the following should apply:\n\n“The hydrate on hover trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content when the mouse has hovered over the triggered area through the mouseenter, mouseover and focusin events.”\n\nHowever, I'm not observing any hydration on hover, and inspecting the DOM shows that no event listeners are attached to the dehydrated block.\n\n✅ Setup\nMy app uses:\nprovideClientHydration(withIncrementalHydration())\n\nIn the template:\n\n@defer (hydrate on hover) {\n  <app-hydration-check></app-hydration-check>\n} @placeholder {\n  <div>Loading...</div>\n}\nThis SSR-renders the <app-hydration-check> element, and the placeholder is not shown (expected ✅). However, on the client:\n\nThe component remains dehydrated\n\nHovering the area does not trigger hydration\n\n🔬 Investigation\nAfter analyzing Angular’s runtime (via monkey-patching addEventListener, DOM inspection, and source exploration), I found:\n\n@defer (on hover) correctly adds eventlisteners:\n\nBut with hydrate on hover elements never hydrated (hover, click, nothing helps)\n\nI confirmed that hydration data is in TransferState under __ngDeferData__\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc65e7a-9304-4871-b1b3-97ac4bfe925b)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b784a0e1-879b-46ee-b2b3-40419e47a009)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb58ae09-cbc1-4ea0-bc4f-61755b86f372)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb6285e-24d6-4e1e-8526-f1e78e6a5017)\n\n🧪 Suggested Debug Tooling\nIt would be helpful to expose a debug utility (in dev mode) that can:\n\nList all dehydrated blocks (d0, d1, …)\nShow which event triggers are registered\nLog when hydration is triggered and on which DOM element\n\nThis would greatly improve DX for incremental hydration debugging.\n\n✅ Expected Behavior\n@defer (hydrate on hover) or @defer (hydrate on interaction) should:\n\nAttach listeners to the appropriate element\nTrigger hydration via proper events\n\n🙏 Request\nCould you confirm whether:\nhydrate on hover is supposed to generate jsaction and ngb attributes?\nThere’s a best practice for debugging which defer blocks are dehydrated + waiting?\n\nP.S.

Specifically, the signal input remains `undefined` on initial load via a deep link, while it updates as expected when navigating within the app.\n\n### Current Behavior\n- Navigating directly to a deep link (e.g., `/server/id/foo`) results in the component’s `id` signal input being `undefined`.\n- Navigating within the app (e.g., from `/server/id/foo` to `/server/id/bar`) correctly updates the `id` signal input to the new value (e.g., `bar`).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- The id signal input should be set to the route parameter value (e.g., 123) when loading the app via a deep link, just as it does during in-app navigation.\n\n## Minimal Reproduction\n1. Create a new Angular 19 project: `ng new repro --standalone`.\n2. Configure the router with `withComponentInputBinding()` in `app.config.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { provideRouter, withComponentInputBinding } from '@angular/router';\nimport { routes } from './app.routes';\n\nexport const appConfig = {\n  providers: [provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())]\n};\n```\n3. Define a route in `app.routes.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';\nimport { LdapServersTabComponent } from './ldap-servers-tab.component';\n\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  { path: 'server/id/:id', component: ChildComponent }\n];\n```\n4. Create a component `child.component.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { Component, input, effect } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    <p>ID: {{ id() }}</p>\n    <a routerLink=\"server/id/foo\">foo</a>\n    <a routerLink=\"/server/id/bar\">bar</a>\n  `,\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  id = input<string>();\n  idEffect = effect(() => console.log('ID:', this.id()));\n}\n```\n5. Start the app: `ng serve`.\n6. Test the following:\n- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/server/id/foo` directly (deep link): `id()` logs `undefined`.\n- Navigate within the app to `/server/id/bar` (e.g., via a `<a routerLink=\"/server/id/bar\">` link): `id()` logs `bar`.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Follow the minimal reproduction steps above.\n2. Open the browser console to observe the `id()` value.\n3.

This approach is not ideal as it requires repeated manual intervention and does not resolve the root cause within the `@angular/build` package.\n2. **Fork and Patch**: Forking the `@angular/build` repository and updating the dependencies in the forked version. This is a temporary solution and introduces maintenance overhead.\n3. **Ignore Vulnerabilities**: Ignoring the reported vulnerabilities in `npm audit`.

The error is thrown from invalidTypeError in test_bed_compiler.ts.  As far as I could tell, the getAnnotation function in the resolver was returning null instead of Component, causing the error to be tripped.  I assume the AOT build is stripping this metadata/the decorator before this check is made.  I couldn't find any way to work around the issue other than rearchitecting my component so that I was no longer needing to make the  overrideComponent call.  As long as overrideComponent was in the stack at all, regardless of what parameters I passed to it, the tests failed due to missing metadata.\n\nI have not tested any of the other types of overrides, but given that most of the code in the TestBed compiler is in common between the decorated types, I would assume they all are impacted in AOT mode.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple valid component, turn on AOT for Karma, and make a test where you use TestBed.overrideComponent to reset metadata.  You don't even need to specify an actual override in the second parameter to trigger the issue: TestBed.overrideComponent(YourComponent, {}) triggers the failure.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n_<class name> class doesn't have @Component decorator or is missing metadata.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30017","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New AOT option for Karma doesn't play nicely with TestBed.overrideComponent\" (#30017)"},{"Id":"2967875594","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T00:48:48","Actor":"hamfastgamgee","Number":"30016","RawContent":null,"Title":"New AOT options for Karma also run code coverage on component HTML files","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the new-in-19.2.x option in angular.json to run Karma using AOT, I was surprised to find that my code coverage metrics suddenly got a lot worse.  Looking into the output of \"ng test\" with code coverage enabled, I found that the number of statements and lines touched roughly doubled compared to when I run the same tests with AOT turned off.  By looking at the files generated by karma-coverage, I found that in AOT mode the component HTML files are also being instrumented for code coverage now.  I assume this is because AOT mode compiles the templates into the Javascript for test execution.\n\nWas this intentional?  If it was, at the very least it probably should have been mentioned in the release notes.  I can't find any way to configure the codeCoverageExclude options to omit the component HTML files.  I would imagine nearly every app will see a drop in their code coverage as a result of this difference, especially given that most of the IDE tooling around code coverage doesn't even consider the possibility that HTML files would be included.  It's also not obvious at all how to cover the HTML; I have files that are listed as fully covered with basically no difference in the tests compared to ones that aren't marked as covered at all.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple component with a simple test and run Karma with code coverage enabled both with AOT enabled and AOT disabled.  With AOT enabled, the component HTML will be instrumented in addition to the Typescript.  With AOT disabled, only the Typescript is instrumented.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New AOT options for Karma also run code coverage on component HTML files\" (#30016)"},{"Id":"2967430008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T21:04:00","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30014","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30014","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30014)"},{"Id":"2967480906","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T20:50:16","Actor":"pawel-twardziak","Number":"30015","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Linter] Add support for Biome","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nI am guessing it is the right time for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to be supported by Angular workspace - what do you think guys?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement the support as an alternative for eslint/prettier\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDo not implement it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30015","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Linter] Add support for Biome\" (#30015)"},{"Id":"2967181454","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T18:20:52","Actor":"wcwcaseman","Number":"30013","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please add a flag to suppress the warning, Add only entry points to the 'files' or 'include' properties in your tsconfig.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn my NX Angular project I add entry points in webpack.

We 've come across on problems that our application started to becoming slow after switching between different screens/routes after a while. It turned out to be memory leaks (Detached nodes that are not garbage collected) and some of the leaks we 've managed to fix because of missing unsubscribtion in our application but others we can't fix and seems to be input and mat-form-field related. We've implemented a workaround that we reload page when memory hits defined limit so we can still deliver a product however angular material related memory leaks are beyond our control.\n\n\n**Description:**\nFirst of all I've created a simple example project that has two screens each in separate module screen-one.module.ts and screen-two.module.ts and those modules are lazy loaded and has its own routes 'screen-one'  and 'screen-two'. Screen one is just empty screen so it doesn't have memory leaks and is used as reference and screen two contains some material components. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nExample 1: [StackBlitz Material input example](https://stackblitz.com/github/EverydayWebDev/simple-material-project/tree/mat-input)\nScreen two contains only mat-form-field with nested input.\n1. Start with Screen One\n2. Navigate to screen two by clicking Screen Two button on left menu\n3. Navigate back to Screen One by clicking on menu button\n4. Open Chrome Dev tools navigate to the memory tab (in case of stackblitz select VM instance webcontainer) and take a heap snapshot\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18d6746b-d617-4369-8b4f-17b684e6909b)\n\nActual Behavior:\nDev tools memory profiling shows 1 Detached Node <div class=\"mat-form-field-flex\" DOM that wasn't garbage collected. Fortunately If I repeat reproduction steps again and again the number of detached <div class=\"mat-form-field-flex\" remains the same.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a47c48-ff32-4537-81fa-cefbe9270ae8)\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAll input and mat-form-field related detached DOM nodes are not present in memory.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nExample 2: [StackBlitz Material input with mat-tab example](https://stackblitz.com/github/EverydayWebDev/simple-material-project/tree/mat-tab)\nScreen two contains only mat-form-field with input that is wrapped with mat-tab and mat-tab-group \n1.

I've mange to narrow it down the css filters when they are applied to html or body element causing the issue. With css filters present on Chrome, when the BottomSheet appear, it resizes the view instead of sliding into view. \n\nTo reproduce: ng new filteproject.  ng add @angular/material . Following the Material io example and add a BottomSheet and open button to the default project page.\n\nAdd  backdrop-filter: brightness(1); to styles.css body\n\n`body { \n  margin: 0; font-family: Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\n  backdrop-filter: brightness(1);\n} `\n\nTrigger the bottomshett and you will a page flicker on Chrome. It works fine in Safari and worked fine in Angular 18 on Chrome.\n\nIf you add a DIV between body and app-root, and apply filters to it, the issue goes away. but BottomSheet and dialog are not affected by the filters anymore. I use filters to create dim the entire document <body> or <html> as a night mode feature.\n\nLooks like its an overlay context issue or something. Not experienced enough to explain it better !\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bapgtgzq?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

It then slides over body and resizes the page as it moves to it final position. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.5\nNode: 18.20.7\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular:

In case of the `add_circle` icon, I would expect its shape to be perfectly round.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe top and bottom of the icon are truncated (cropped) which makes it painfully _not round_.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b00a4b4-e485-43b1-8786-9d8315c6fabd)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.7\n- Browser(s): Edge, Chrome and Firefox\n- Operating System: Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30763","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button, mat-icon): mat-icon inside of mat-button are truncated\" (#30763)"},{"Id":"2964323496","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-01T18:57:51","Actor":"szoboszlaypali","Number":"30762","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/overlay): scroll was blocked when zoomed out even if scrolling wasn't an option","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that an unnecessary disabled scroll bar was added when zoomed out during opening dialogs.\r\n\r\nFixes #25054.\r\n\r\nWhen you zoom out using the browser (not the style.zoom css), dimensions can become non-whole numbers. window.innerHeight/innerWidth uses Math.floor to round these dimensions, while body.scrollHeight/scrollWidth uses Math.round (at least that's what I assume), so in case you zoom out and your browser shows that your width is 1000.66px for example, the previous implementation returned false positives if there were no scroll bars, as the scrollWidth was 1001px while innerWidth was only 1000.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I've ran into is using the style.zoom css api, while the innerHeight and innerWidth remains unchanged during zoom, [working as intended](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/335337924) body.scrollWidth can outgrow window.innerWidth without a scroll bar appearing (easily testable with the Google home page).\r\n\r\nRelying on the root documentElement's scrollWidth and scrollHeight seems to fix both cases.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30762","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/overlay): scroll was blocked when zoomed out even if scrolling wasn't an option\" (#30762)"},{"Id":"2964289240","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-01T18:43:01","Actor":"clamli","Number":"30761","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(RadioButton): Enter a required radio group, SR announces \"required invalid data\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nScreen reader announces \"required invalid data...\" when user enters an empty radio group that is required.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/uex8xzys?file=src%2Fexample%2Fradio-ng-model-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

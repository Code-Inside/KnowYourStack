Currently, services loaded on a route are cached for that route for the lifetime of the application.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in the linked reproduction, where service instances are not destroyed after navigating to the otherpage route. To achieve this behavior, we need to create a wrapper component that only contains a <router-outlet> and has the services included in the component, which is an unnecessary abstraction in my opinion.\r\n\r\nGood article about it:\r\n\r\nhttps://itnext.io/mastering-injectable-services-a-comprehensive-guide-6c2c0f5f48a2\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5hzubt?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts,angular.json,src%2Fpages%2Fotherpage.component.ts,src%2Fexample.service.ts,src%2Findex.html,src%2Fpages%2Fhomepage%2Fhomepage-1.component.ts,src%2Fpages%2Fhomepage%2Fhomepage-2.component.ts%3AL5&file=src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Fexample.service.ts,src%2Fpages%2Fhomepage%2Fhomepage-1.component.ts,src%2Fpages%2Fhomepage%2Fhomepage-2.component.ts,src%2Fpages%2Fotherpage.component.ts&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI'm not sure if this is the best solution, but perhaps adding an additional hermeticProviders array to the route configuration \r\n`{path: 'some-route', providers:[], **hermeticProviders**: []}`\r\n would help create instances that only live for the duration of the route.

Similarly, for component reference properties (2). I know that it is currently possible to get a reference to a component by clicking on it and typing $ng0 in the console, but this is not intuitive and I have the impression that few people remember this option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution [Feature Request only]\n\nI think it works very well and intuitively in the case of the Injector Tree, where there is an arrow icon that logs the service directly to the console.

( option documentation: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names )\r\n\r\nDigging through the source code I found some comments giving insight on it not being of much use anymore for angular itself.\r\nSo I am guessing it has been removed in assumption it would not matter, because angular does not rely on class names.\r\nUnfortunately, other 3rd party libraries may depend on class names being intact.\r\n\r\nWith the keepNames option being removed, we can only build a working app with enabling keepIdentifierNames - which will result in a whopping 30-35 % code size increase.\r\n\r\nAllowing devs to set this flag shouldn't be problematic or complex as it is just an additional option that can be passed to esbuild.\r\n\r\nRight now our choices are to release a heavily bloated/unoptimized app or to rip apart JavaScriptOptimizerPlugin and re-implement it on our own - just to be able to set that one option again. :( \r\n\r\nPlease consider reintroducing support for it.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nDue to the kind of issue, a reproduction makes no sense.\r\n\r\nExecute compilation of any named class with buildOptions.keepNames = true.\r\n\r\nAngular 15 would generate minified code with intact class names.\r\nAngular 17 will generate code with obfuscated class names.\r\n\r\nResponsible source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/15.2.10/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/plugins/javascript-optimizer-worker.ts#L174\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.1.3\r\nNode: 18.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.4.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack   0.1701.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27169","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Regression] support for optimization with intact class names (JavaScriptOptimizerOptions.keepNames)\" (#27169)"},{"Id":"2156933072","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-27T15:41:34","Actor":"tom-vism","Number":"27168","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Nx + Tailwind + Postcss] tailwind.config.js is ignored in the NX project root when application builder is used","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI use NX monorepo with 17.2.2 Angular version. \r\nAn app has a tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.json file. \r\n\r\nI changed the builder to \"application\" and made changes in the project.json (known as angular.json) but the compiler shows some warnings (about \"content\" property not being found) and then errors because it ignores tailwind configuration in the project root.

Create an NX project for Angular ^17.2 with the workspace structure like below (reference to the older issue with steps for setting up tailwind for Angular CLI: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27005.)\r\n2. Use the application builder and make necessary changes in project.json of the app (known as angular.json)\r\n3. Create the postcss configuration file (postcss.config.json) in the project root\r\n\r\nMy workspace structure looks something like this:\r\n```\r\nmy-nx-workspace/\r\n|-- apps/\r\n|   |-- group\r\n|   |   |-- app1/\r\n|   |   |   |-- src/\r\n|   |   |   |-- postcss.config.json\r\n|   |   |   |-- tailwind.config.js\r\n|   |   |   |-- project.json\r\n|   |   |   |-- ...\r\n|   |   |-- app2/\r\n|   |   |   |-- src/\r\n|-- libs/\r\n|   |-- shared-lib/\r\n|   |   |-- src/\r\n|-- tools/\r\n|-- node_modules/\r\n|-- nx.json\r\n|-- package.json\r\n|-- tsconfig.base.json\r\n|-- tailwind-base-configuration.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy postcss.config.json looks like this\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": {\r\n    \"postcss-import\": {},\r\n    \"tailwindcss\": {},\r\n    \"autoprefixer\": {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy project tailwind.config.js looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { createGlobPatternsForDependencies } = require('@nx/angular/tailwind');\r\nconst { join } = require('path');\r\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: [\r\n    join(__dirname, 'src/**/!(*.stories|*.spec).{ts,html}'),\r\n    ...createGlobPatternsForDependencies(__dirname),\r\n  ],\r\n  presets: [require('../../../tailwind-base-configuration.js')],\r\n  theme: {\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\nIt cannot find tailwind.config.js in the project root\r\n\r\n```text\r\nwarn - The `content` option in your Tailwind CSS configuration is missing or empty.\r\nwarn - Configure your content sources or your generated CSS will be missing styles.\r\nX [ERROR] The `dark:bg-primary-dark` class does not exist.

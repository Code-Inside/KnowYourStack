The result is that:\r\n* We duplicate less information between the `TNode` and the directive definition.\r\n* `DirectiveDef.inputs` has a consistent type no matter how an input is configured which makes it easier to reason about.\r\n* We need less information in order to write to a directive's input.\r\n* We can remove the `InputTransformsFeature`.\r\n* We can remove the `DirectiveDef.inputTransforms` field.\r\n* We no longer need to store input flags in `TNode.inputs`.\r\n* We store 2 less values in the `TNode.initialInputs` data structure.\r\n* We don't resolve the native element for property writes in production mode. In development mode it's only used for the `ng-reflect-` attributes.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): simplify how inputs are stored in the directive definition\r\nCurrently the values in `DirectiveDef.inputs` are either strings or arrays, depending if there are flags. This makes it a bit hard to work with, because each time it's read, the consumer needs to account for both cases.\r\n\r\nThese changes rework it so the values are always an arrays.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): remove inputTransforms from definition \r\nRemoves the `inputTransform` from the directive definition since this information is already available on the `inputs`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): remove input transforms feature \r\nAn earlier refactor made the `InputTransformsFeature` a no-op so these changes remove the code that was generating it.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): remove flags from TNode.inputs \r\nThe input flags are already available on the definition so we don't need to store them on `TNode.inputs`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): simplify InitialInputs data structure\r\nReworks the `InitialInputs` data structure to only store a public name and initial value, resulting in less memory usage and making it easier to work with.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): refactor(core): avoid unnecessary lookup when writing inputs\r\nCurrently we resolve the DOM node when writing inputs up-front, because it's necessary for the `ng-reflect-` attributes. Since the attributes are dev-mode-only, we can move the resolution into the function that writes them so we can avoid the resolution when it's not used.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add assertion to avoid writes to directive factories\r\nAttempting to write to directive inputs before the directive is created can lead to subtle issues that won't necessarily trigger errors. These changes add an assertion to catch such issues earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59980","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Input writing refactors\" (#59980)"},{"Id":"2857554554","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T11:21:55","Actor":"geromegrignon","Number":"59979","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: migrate reactive forms to standalone","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Perhaps code needs to pass the CustomErrorHandler TWO exceptions in the case of primary/secondary as today it received the 2ndary render exception and not the primary exception which was the original cause(ie. without the primary, the 2ndary would not happen).  I spent hours on this before I finally found out what is going on (much because I was never given the primary exception and was given something in left field) -> \n\nIn my init method of my component we have this \n\n```\n        this._proposalSvc.proposalXref$\n            .pipe(takeUntil(this._unsubscribeAll))\n            .subscribe((response: FetchProposalXrefResponse) => {\n                this.xrefResponse = response;\n\n                if (\n                    this.xrefResponse.outline.trainingFormat ===\n                    ClassFormatEnumDto.MULTI_DAY\n                ) {\n                    this.isMultiDay = true;\n                }\n\n                this.statusInfo = new StatusInfo();\n                this.statusInfo.projectName = response.outline?.projectName;\n                this.statusInfo.stage = response.courseStage;\n                this.statusInfo.hasCredits = true;\n                this.statusInfo.creditsLeft = response?.customerCreditsLeft;\n\n                this.statusInfo.avatar = new AvatarInfo();\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.chatId = response.proposalXref?.xrefId;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.link = response?.otherParty?.avatar;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.firstName =\n                    response?.otherParty?.firstName;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.lastName =\n                    response?.otherParty?.lastName;\n\n                this.calculateIfAvailable();\n            });\n```\n\nNow, if you throw an exception on the LAST line, GREAT!!!  If you throw an exception on the FIRST line, it will be hidden by a render exception.  Worse yet, the customErrorHandler is never told about the primary exception and that is the one we care about and need to fix ASAP.    The 2ndary can be fixed but not as important by making things optional in the html (things that are actually required but on failure will not be there).     \n\nIf you know of 'javas' try with resource,  try (stream str = openStream()) { .....code here }, it secretly has a stream.close() surrounded with a try..catch to not lose the primary exception.  it then adds the 'supressed' 2ndary exception to the primary so you have both (and you end up with array of suppression but the global error handler ends up with the primarys which has supressedErrors[].  Java also has chained exceptions.  this is when you catch, rethrow new Exception(\"my chain\", e); such that the new error links to old one (realy only for adding info that may only be available near the top of stack to the message.  (Do not confuse supressed and chained...two different concepts).\n\nI would love suppressed in the case of render failures!!!  \n\nI would LOVE to know if it was a render failure so I can just move the user to a solid bug page that I know will render cleanly.  \n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/core/ErrorHandler\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nA way to expose primary exceptions and not hide them if render fails in face of primary failure.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nmoving up and down throw new Error(\"test\") in my above code since the html page required some of those things to be setup. \n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\npass me TWO exceptions somehow in case of primary/secondary exceptions (usually bug then a render failure)\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\nno screen show.\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\nnot browser specific\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59976","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"clarity needed on primary exception -> render exception, primary exception hidden\" (#59976)"},{"Id":"2857301345","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T09:40:31","Actor":"sunio00000","Number":"59975","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): Support instanceof operator in Built-in control flow (Angular templates)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Description\n\nI'm interested in hearing opinions on allowing the use of the instanceof operator within the @if control block.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, wrapping utility function calls with `runInInjectionContext` is the only way to allow utility functions to use `inject`.\r\n\r\nFor example, say we want to write a simplified way to track clicks in our app (the full example is available as documentation of the `bindToInjectionContext`).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Provide context for where the click happened via the injection context\r\nconst CLICK_AREA = new InjectionToken<string>('click-area');\r\n\r\n// This utility function provides a simplified interface to an imaginary TrackingService. But it\r\n// must be called inside an injection context to work. \r\nfunction trackClick(description: string) {\r\n  const clickArea = inject(CLICK_AREA);\r\n  const tracker = inject(TrackerService);\r\n  tracker.trackClick({\r\n    clickArea,\r\n    description,\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use `trackClick`, callers must ensure, that it is called inside an injection context:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({ /* ... */ })\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  // ⚠️ We create a dependency from this component to Injector, even though\r\n  // we don't need it directly\r\n  private readonly injector = inject(Injector);\r\n\r\n  trackClick(description: string) {\r\n    runInInjectionContext(this.injector, () => trackClick(description));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this once is fine, but having to do this for every component that wants to call the `trackClick` function is repetitive and tedious.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also replace the `inject` calls of the `trackClick` function with parameters, like so:\r\n\r\n ```ts\r\nfunction trackClick(description: string, clickArea: string, tracker: TrackerService) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now the utility function is basically useless. The caller needs to inject both the `CLICK_AREA` and the `TrackerService`. Therefore the caller now needs to know about the services and how to track clicks properly. Might as well just call the `TrackerService` directly.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nWith `bindToInjectionContext`, developers have a much simpler way of calling utility functions, that need to have access to the current injection context.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, `bindToInjectionContext` will take a function and return a new function, that - when called - executes the target function inside the bound injection context. The injection context can be user-controlled, but falls back to the current injection context (via `inject(Injector)`).\r\n\r\nThe above example component can therefore be simplified down to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({ /* ... */ })\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  trackClick = bindToInjectionContext(trackClick);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nOriginally, I wanted the utility function to be called `withInjectionContext`, as it reads nicer. However, I felt like the function name needs to properly communicate that this will bind the given callback to a specific context - just like  [Function.prototype.bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind).

This change lets it also accept `EnvironmentProviders`, making it easier to customize things like interceptors or backend replacements. `provideHttpClient()` already converts providers to `EnvironmentProviders`, so this just makes the API more consistent. 🚀\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow EnvironmentProviders in HttpFeature for Custom HTTP Client Features\" (#59969)"},{"Id":"2855741423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-15T22:09:59","Actor":"dapperdandev","Number":"59968","RawContent":null,"Title":"rxResource: Expose `request` as WriteableSignal","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\n`resource` and `rxResource` expect a signal for the `request`. \n\n```typescript\nexport interface Post {\n  id?: number;\n  title: string;\n  body: string;\n}\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class PostsService {\n  private readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient);\n\n  public post = signal(null);\n  public createPost= (): ResourceRef<Post> =>\n    rxResource({\n      request: () => this.post(),\n      loader: ({ request }) => {\n        if (!request) return of(null);\n        return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n          'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n          request\n        );\n      },\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThe example above (based on most public examples) demonstrates how this pattern requires the `post` signal to exist outside of the `createPost` function. The service now lacks cohesion since other potential methods/functions are unlikely to utilize the `post` signal. E.g., `getAllPosts()`.\n\nOne workaround is to change the createPost signature to accept a signal parameter:\n\n```typescript\npublic createPost = (post: Signal<Post>) => rxResource({ request: () => post, ... })\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this just moves the cohesion problem to the service consumer.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI believe `request` should be exposed as a `WriteableSignal`:\n\n```typescript\n// service\n ...\n  public createPost = (): ResourceRef<Post> =>\n    rxResource({\n      loader: ({ request }) => {\n        return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n          'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n          request\n        );\n      },\n    });\n ...\n\n// component\n...\nprivate readonly postsService = inject(PostsService);\npublic createPostResource = this.postsService.createPost();\n\npublic createPost(post: Post): void {\n   this.createPostResource.request.set(post);\n}\n```\n\nThis would improve cohesion in services utilizing `rxResource`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs a personal workaround, I extended `ResourceRef` with a `data: WriteableSignal` property. `data` isn't the best name, but `request` was taken :)\n\n```typescript\nexport interface DataResourceRef<T = unknown, U = unknown>\n  extends ResourceRef<T> {\n  data: WritableSignal<U>;\n}\n\nexport interface Post { ... }\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class PostsService {\n  private readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient);\n\n  public createPost = (post: Post): DataResourceRef<Post, Post> => {\n    const data = signal<Post>(post);\n    return {\n      data,\n      ...rxResource({\n        request: () => data(),\n        loader: ({ request }) => {\n          if (!request) return of(null);\n          return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n            'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n            request\n          );\n        },\n      }),\n    };\n  };\n```\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule, JsonPipe],\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class App {\n  private readonly postsService = inject(PostsService);\n  protected createPostResource = this.postsService.createPost(null);\n  protected form = new FormGroup({\n    title: new FormControl(''),\n    body: new FormControl(''),\n  });\n\n  addPost(): void {\n    this.createPostResource.data.set(this.form.getRawValue());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5bqmba9u?file=src%2Fmain.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59968","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"rxResource: Expose `request` as WriteableSignal\" (#59968)"},{"Id":"2855614134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-15T17:21:01","Actor":"Zur13","Number":"59967","RawContent":null,"Title":"Memory Leak on page changes with NgForOf","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nSTR:\n\n1.

This, however, blocks other interactions that should be available like scrolling.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the member cards highlighting relies on element focus which doesn't seem very right by itself given we enforce `tabIndex=-1`. The highlighting should be active when the user clicks on a member/property which, respectively, adds a fragment to the URL, scrolls the page down and adds an outline to the specific card.

Interestingly, the component library builds successfully without needing a module to provide DatePipe.\n\nHowever, the application only runs if I add DatePipe to the providers array in main.ts within my test harness. This shouldn’t be a requirement for a component library—I want to avoid tightly coupling the library to any consuming application in this way.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue:\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce the \"No Provider for DatePipe\" Error in Angular 19 Component Library**\n\n#### **1. Create a New Angular Component Library**\n   - Generate a new Angular workspace with a library:\n     ```sh\n     ng new my-workspace --create-application=false\n     cd my-workspace\n     ng generate library my-lib\n     ```\n   - Navigate to the `projects/my-lib` directory.\n\n#### **2. Create a Component That Uses `DatePipe`**\n   - Inside `projects/my-lib/src/lib/`, create a new component:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate component date-display\n     ```\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to use `DatePipe`:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **3. Ensure `NgModule` is Removed (Standalone Component)**\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to make it a standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       standalone: true,\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **4. Build the Library**\n   - Run:\n     ```sh\n     ng build my-lib\n     ```\n   - The build should succeed without errors.\n\n#### **5. Create a Test Application**\n   - Generate a new Angular application to test the library:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate application test-app\n     ```\n   - Add the library to the application:\n     ```sh\n     ng add my-lib\n     ```\n\n#### **6. Use the Component in the Test Application**\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.html` and add:\n     ```html\n     <lib-date-display></lib-date-display>\n     ```\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.ts` and import the standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DateDisplayComponent } from 'my-lib';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'app-root',\n       standalone: true,\n       imports: [DateDisplayComponent],\n       template: '<lib-date-display></lib-date-display>'\n     })\n     export class AppComponent {}\n     ```\n\n#### **7. Run the Application**\n   ```sh\n   ng serve test-app\n   ```\n   - **Expected Behavior:** The app should run without issues.\n   - **Actual Behavior:** A runtime error occurs:  \n     ```\n     Error: NG0203: No provider for DatePipe!\n     ```\n\n#### **8. Workaround: Add `DatePipe` to `main.ts`**\n   - Modify `test-app/src/main.ts` to provide `DatePipe` globally:\n     ```typescript\n     import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n     import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';\n     import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n       providers: [DatePipe]\n     });\n     ```\n   - **Now the application runs correctly.**\n\n### **Issue Summary**\n- The component library builds successfully.\n- Despite providing `DatePipe` at the component level, Angular still throws a \"No Provider\" error at runtime.\n- The app only works when `DatePipe` is provided at the application level (`main.ts`), which **forces tight coupling** between the library and the consuming application.\n\n### **Expected Behavior**\n- Since `DatePipe` is provided in the standalone component, the app should not require an additional provider in `main.ts`.\n- The component library should be self-contained and not require the consuming application to explicitly provide `DatePipe`.\n\nLet me know if you need any refinements! 🚀\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_MapMainComponent])[_MapMessageService -> _MapMessageService -> _MapToolsMenubarComponent -> _MenuBarImportService -> _MenuBarImportService -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for _DatePipe!\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.7\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.7\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.7 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.7\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\n@angular/cli                    19.1.7\n@angular/language-service       19.1.6\n@angular/localize               19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.7\nng-packagr                      19.1.2\nrxjs                            6.6.7\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng19 Component Library Components not recognizing provider DatePipe\" (#59963)"},{"Id":"2854455841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T19:14:24","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"59961","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] build: update babel dependencies to v7.26.9","State":"closed","Body":"This is a Patch PR of #59743\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following updates:\r\n\r\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.0` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.26.0/7.26.9) |\r\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.5` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.26.5/7.26.9) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/core)</summary>\r\n\r\n### [`v7.26.9`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7269-2025-02-14)\r\n\r\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.26.8...v7.26.9)\r\n\r\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\r\n\r\n-   `babel-types`\r\n    -

However, several options have been adjusted:\r\n* `builderMode` was removed\r\n* `fileReplacements` legacy structure (`src`/`replaceWith`) removed\r\n* `polyfills` only accepts an array of strings\r\n* `loader` has been added\r\n* `define` has been added\r\n* `externalDependencies` has been added\r\n* `sass` sub-option for `stylePreprocessorOptions` has been added\r\n\r\nFrom an implementation perspective, the test finding logic and the application builder integration have been moved to the `@angular/build` package and reused by the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` package via the private export of `@angular/build`.\r\n\r\nCloses: #28809\r\nCloses: #28321\r\nCloses: #29185","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29640","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): add application builder karma testing to package\" (#29640)"},{"Id":"2850288909","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-13T20:40:05","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29629","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): prefer installed package as fallback when listing package groups","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nPreviously, the package group name defaulted to the first item in the list.

Download the project from StackBlitz.\n2. Start it and open in the Edge browser. Open the deprecated \"Detached elements\" tool.\n3. Drag an item from the \"To do\" column to the \"In progress\" column and then to \"Done\".\n4. Collect garbage in the \"Detached elements\" tool and check detached items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are no detached nodes related to the cdk-drag element.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere are 2 `cdk-drag-dragging` detached nodes. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fb8a7e-869d-4858-b1f0-b2d79177eb53)\n\nThe same result will be achieved if performed in Chrome, but more details can be seen in the Edge. If the \"Analyze\" button is clicked - you will get an id to the retainer (instead of the initial text \"Object not found in memory anymore\"). Double-clicking on it will show the retainer info. In this case, it's the `CdkDropList._dropListRef._draggables` array.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f25936c-c259-46f6-955a-73de1381b42b)\n\n**Some info after my analysis**: `_draggables` are set in the `DropListRef`'s `withItems` method.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56971d06-deaf-4f0d-86b8-8e73101221ed)\n\nWhile debugging I should have entered it via `_syncItemsWithRef`, but there's a `this._dropListRef.isDragging()` condition in the `removeItem` method. In my case, I've already dropped an item and it's no longer dragging. Therefore `_draggables` are not updated and there's a `cdk-drag` detached node because of that.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010937-ced3-4911-bd12-4ef965ab2085)\n\nI'm not sure if that condition should be there at all, cause surely we need to sync items with ref **not only when dragging is in progress**. Here's a [link to the commit](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/d1a6ea74db0881001bf02ff113f269552effc4f6) where those changes were added.\n\nFor my project, I monkey-patched `removeItem` method and removed `isDragging()` condition. For us, the case when an item should be removed while dragging is not relevant.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.6\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11 Pro\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[drag-drop] cdk-drag node is detached after element is dropped from one container to another\" (#30506)"},{"Id":"2857713761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T12:28:18","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30505","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/paginator): disabled buttons not visible in high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"#29379 changed the selector for disabled buttons from `[disabled]` to `[aria-disabled]`, however it didn't apply the same change to the high contrast styles which led to them being invisible in dark mode.\r\n\r\nI've also improved the experience by styling the buttons as disabled in high contrast mode.\r\n\r\nFixes #30504.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30505","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/paginator): disabled buttons not visible in high contrast mode\" (#30505)"},{"Id":"2857532126","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T11:12:41","Actor":"loociano","Number":"30504","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Paginator): Disabled buttons are not visible on high contrast mode (CSS media forced-colors)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nPaginator buttons when disabled are not accessible on high contrast mode.

This is mainly to be able to show the previously selected options (ideally in the form of chips with mat-chip). So we can't do that with a placeholder.\nIdeally I want to be able to do this:\n\n```\n<mat-select-trigger>\n    <div class=\"chips\">\n        @for (option of options; track $index) {\n        <mat-chip (removed)=\"removeOption(option)\">\n            {{ option.title }}\n            <button matChipRemove>\n                <mat-icon>remove_circle_outline</mat-icon>\n            </button>\n        </mat-chip>\n        }\n    </div>\n</mat-select-trigger>\n```\nAnd be able to see the options as chips in the trigger part.\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAny hard coded or dynamic values inside the mat-select-trigger won't show on the initial load. \nIf we click on any options it will be shown\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.3\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.3\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30499","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatSelect): MatSelectTrigger does not show the initial default value\" (#30499)"},{"Id":"2856384662","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-16T22:53:13","Actor":"amazing4u","Number":"30498","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatTooltip): Tooltips not working in 19.1.4 on ssr page: TypeError: t is not iterable","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.1.3\n\n### Description\n\nIn Version 19.1.4 of @angular/material the tooltips stopped working on all elements (buttons, div etc.) when i load the server side rendered page.\nMaybe a problem with hydration of the MatTooltip!?\n\nif i navigate in the app to another component and back then it works again.\n\n\nI get this stack trace error: \n\n```\nTypeError: t is not iterable\n    at Ew (core.mjs:16364:32)\n    at Uw (core.mjs:17954:42)\n    at zw (core.mjs:17969:8)\n    at Fh (core.mjs:17871:3)\n    at Bw (core.mjs:17644:10)\n    at Yf (core.mjs:5158:17)\n    at Zf (core.mjs:5120:19)\n    at Ft.get (core.mjs:5405:12)\n    at i.show (tooltip.mjs:291:97)\n    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (tooltip.mjs:575:16)\n```\n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI could not provide a working StackBlitz example.

For the main app and some projects, I want to set `noImplicitAny: true` for the TypeScript compiler, but for some others, I want it to remain `false` (the default). The `tsconfig.lib.json` files inside the libraries are extending the main `tsconfig.json` from the root Angular folder (although I tried removing the `extends` as well, no difference, read below).\r\n\r\nThe problem is, no matter what I do, I keep getting errors about `noImplicitAny` from the libraries where it is even explicitly set to false! It seems that the TypeScript compiler disregards the individual `tsconfig.lib.json` settings inside those libraries and takes the global setting.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I tried moving the setting from the main `tsconfig.json` in the root folder, to the app-specific `src/tsconfig.app.json` and I still get the same error from the libraries!\r\n\r\nThese are the other contents of the main `tsconfig.json` file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\r\n        \"outDir\": \"./dist/out-tsc\",\r\n        \"module\": \"es2022\",\r\n        \"target\": \"es2022\",\r\n        \"lib\": [\"es2022\", \"dom\"],\r\n        \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\r\n        \"noImplicitOverride\": true,\r\n        \"noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature\": true,\r\n        \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\r\n        \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\r\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n        \"declaration\": false,\r\n        \"downlevelIteration\": true,\r\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": false,\r\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\r\n        \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\r\n        \"importHelpers\": true,\r\n        \"typeRoots\": [\"node_modules/@types\"],\r\n        \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\r\n    },\r\n    \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat\": false,\r\n        \"strictInjectionParameters\": true,\r\n        \"strictInputAccessModifiers\": true,\r\n        \"strictTemplates\": true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are not using \"full\" TypeScript strict mode.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThis is a repo which reproduces the problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/digeomel/angular-no-implicit-any\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.4\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.4\r\nng-packagr                      16.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI posted this issue first on the Typescript repo and I got the answer that this is the expected behaviour, but I thought that maybe the Angular compiler spawns individual, separate processes to compile each project, respecting the tsconfig file in each.\r\nIn any case, this seems counter-intuitive to me.

for unsupported platforms, users can use the `@rollup/wasm-node` package that has the same interface as Rollup but relies on WASM artifacts ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   The \"with\" syntax for import attributes is not yet supported, awaiting support in SWC ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   The `INVALID_IMPORT_ASSERTION` error code has been replaced with `INVALID_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE` ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   Rollup will now warn for `@__PURE__` and `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` annotations in invalid locations ([#&#8203;5165](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5165))\n-   If an entry module starts with a shebang comment `#!...`, this comment will be prepended to the output for `es` and `cjs` formats ([#&#8203;5163](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5163))\n-   File hashes will now use url-safe base64 encoded hashes ([#&#8203;5155](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5155))\n-   The maximum hash length has been reduced to 22 characters ([#&#8203;5155](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5155))\n-   The `RollupWarning` type has been removed in favor of the `RollupLog` type ([#&#8203;5147](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5147))\n\n##### Changes to Rollup Options\n\n-   Acorn plugins are no longer supported, the `acornInjectPlugins` option has been removed ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   The `acorn` option has been removed ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   `output.externalImportAssertions` has been deprecated in favor of `output.externalImportAttributes` ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   `inlineDynamicImports`, `manualChunks` and `preserveModules` have been removed on input option level: Please use the corresponding output options of the same names ([#&#8203;5143](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5143))\n-   Removed output options ([#&#8203;5143](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5143)):\n    -   `output.experimentalDeepDynamicChunkOptimization`: This option is no longer needed as Rollup now always runs the full chunking algorithm\n    -   `output.dynamicImportFunction`: Use the `renderDynamicImport` plugin hook instead\n    -   `output.namespaceToStringTag`: Use `output.generatedCode.symbols` instead\n    -   `output.preferConst`: Use `output.generatedCode.constBindings` instead\n\n##### Plugin API Changes\n\n-   For `this.resolve`, the default of the `skipSelf` option is now `true` ([#&#8203;5142](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5142))\n-   `this.parse` now only supports the `allowReturnOutsideFunction` option for now ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   Import assertions now use the [new import attribute AST structure](https://togithub.com/estree/estree/blob/master/experimental/import-attributes.md) ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   \"assertions\" have been replaced with \"attributes\" in various places of the plugin interface ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   If the import of a module id is handled by the `load` hook of a plugin, `rollup.watch` no longer watches the actual file if the module id corresponds to a real path; if this is intended, then the plugin is responsible for calling `this.addWatchFile` for any dependency files ([#&#8203;5150](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5150))\n-   The normalized input options provided by `buildStart` and other hooks no longer contain an `onwarn` handler; plugins should use `onLog` instead ([#&#8203;5147](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5147))\n-   `this.moduleIds` has been removed from the plugin context: Use `this.getModuleIds()` instead ([#&#8203;5143](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5143))\n-   The `hasModuleSideEffects` flag has been removed from the `ModuleInfo` returned by `thi s.getModuleInfo()`: Use `moduleSideEffects` on the `ModuleInfo` instead ([#&#8203;5143](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5143))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Improve parsing speed by switching to a native SWC-based parser ([#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5073))\n-   Rollup will now warn for `@__PURE__` and `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` annotations in invalid locations ([#&#8203;5165](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5165))\n-   The parser is now exposed as a separate export `parseAst` ([#&#8203;5169](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5169))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Rollup no longer tries to watch virtual files if their name corresponds to an actual file name; instead, plugins handle watching via `this.addWatchFile()` ([#&#8203;5150](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5150))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5073](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5073): \\[v4.0] Switch parser to SWC and introduce native/WASM code ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5142](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5142): \\[v4.0] Set the default of skipSelf to true ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5143](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5143): \\[v4.0] Remove deprecated features ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5144](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5144): \\[v4.0] Imporve the performance of generating ast and rollup ast nodes ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5147](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5147): \\[v4.0] Remove onwarn from normalized input options ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5150](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5150): \\[v4.0] feat: Do not watch files anymore if their content is returned by the load hook ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5154](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5154): \\[v4.0] Add parse option to allow return outside function ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5155](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5155): \\[v4.0] feat: implement hashing content in Rust ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5157](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5157): \\[v4.0] Handle empty exports ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5160](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5160): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5163](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5163): \\[v4.0] feat: preserve shebang in entry module for CJS and ESM outputs ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5164](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5164): \\[v4.0] fix: also strip BOM from code strings in JS ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5165](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5165): \\[v4.0] warn for invalid annotations ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5168](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5168): \\[v4.0] Ensure we support new import attribute \"with\" syntax ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5169](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5169): \\[v4.0] Expose parser ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

That way you can see the difference even better and basically compare things side by side.\r\n\r\nThe solution might also be to put a version select inside of the component page, but again it would have much more value if I could open another version in a new tab.\r\n\r\nLet's make the documentation of the component library that represents very good UI/UX design as easy to use and as user-friendly as the design itself.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27912","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(website): Changing the version in the website's header should redirect to the page you were on\" (#27912)"},{"Id":"1929849390","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T10:15:24","Actor":"magentaRE","Number":"27911","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(sidenav/drawer/focustrap): tabindex creates invisible elements","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nlegacy non MDC-based components\n\n### Description\n\n`mat-sidenav` generates two `<div>` elements that have tabindex set to 0, **even if the sidenav is closed**. This happens in `mode=\"over\"` of sidenav:\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"cdk-visually-hidden cdk-focus-trap-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\"></div>`\r\n\r\nAlthough they have `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, they can be tabbed into which creates **major** accessibility issue for keyboard users. In previous versions of sidenav, the `tabindex=\"0\"` was only added **after** the sidenav was opened and it was **removed** when user closed the sidenav. User can tab onto those 2 `div`s (with the sidenav closed). That creates 2 invisible elements which can confuse user while navigating through the website.\r\n\r\nThis issue is basically same as #27623, but in that issue, the concern was that Axe core found 2 issues, which is different to this issue. This issue is concerned about tabbing onto \"invisible\" elements. IMO, this is a regression bug and adding `tabindex=\"0\"` should be done only when the sidenav is opened. Also, will #27629 fix this issue as well?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/rwjkdz-juypse?file=src%2Fexample%2Fsidenav-autosize-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Observe that the mat-divider component is missing in the printed or saved output.\r\n\r\n**Using chrome:**\r\n ![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/31477606/26df1781-3513-496f-a4e5-e6c48b8c1820)\r\n\r\n**Using Firefox:** \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/31477606/cd47c140-31f2-4da5-86fc-c2427421cbf2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nDisplay the divider when printing and saving using Firefox\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe mat-divider component is not visible in the printed or saved output.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 12.2.13\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.17\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox  version 118.0.1 (64 bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27897","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-divider): mat-divider not displaying when printing or saving in Firefox\" (#27897)"},{"Id":"1926415568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T14:57:39","Actor":"cromefire","Number":"27896","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): Fixed raw date value being compared","State":"open","Body":"In the function [`isInRange`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L617) numeric values are supposed to be compared. It is being called from [`_isInRange`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L342) where `value` is compared to `startValue` and `endValue` which are calculated in [`_setRanges`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L599-L600) using [`_getCellCompareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L578) which returns a number derived from `Date` derived from the original generic date object. `value` though is not a number like the typing might suggest, but a generic date object [retrieved from `MatCalendarCell.rawValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L515).\r\n\r\nThe correct way to compare these values would be to derive **all** 3 `startValue`, `endValue` and `value` using `_getCellCompareValue`, luckily the `MatCalendarCell` already contains such a derived value: [`compareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L47), which is being [derived using `_getCellCompareValue`]()\r\n\r\n#### Why is this a problem and why isn't it a problem for most?\r\nNormally when using `Date` as your generic date object of choice, the [`isInRange`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L617) function implicitly calls the `valueOf()` function from `Date`, which happens to be equivalent to the logic in [`_getCellCompareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L578).\r\n\r\nBut we are using the Picker with `Temporal.PlainDate` (using a polyfill), which [explicitly forbids](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindate.html#valueOf) calling the `valueOf()` function and the logic breaks down. This change should not result in any visible change for anyone using generic date objects that already do the conversion to unix timestamp implicitly, just that it's done explicitly now, but it will fix compatibility with other choices that don't do this.\r\n\r\nAlso on another note: The current way this is implemented violates TypeScript constraints, because it passes a `Date` or other date type to a function which only accepts a `number`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27896","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): Fixed raw date value being compared\" (#27896)"},{"Id":"1926259097","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T13:46:52","Actor":"shammy8","Number":"27895","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(menu): Disabled mat-menu-item on anchor tag still clickable","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA disabled mat-menu-item anchor  ie`<a disabled mat-menu-item (click)=\"stillGetsCalled()\" routerLink=\"/stillNavigates\"> Anchor</a>` looks disabled but is still clickable.\r\n\r\nHowever a regular href `<a disabled mat-menu-item href=\"https://www.google.com\"> Google</a>` works as expected\r\n\r\nThis occurs with the cdk menu item too. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/32sike?file=src%2Fexample%2Fmenu-icons-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

The indexer currently passes (and ngc-wrapped#compile\r\naccepts) a bazel host to use, but because many methods are overwritten\r\nspecially for Angular compilation a better approach is to pass an old\r\nbazel compiler host and siphon methods needed off of it before creating\r\na new host.

In order to achieve this I would have to set the href attribute of an \"a\" tag with the base64 value of the file.\r\n\r\nThis causes a warning [WARNING: sanitizing unsafe URL]. The logical solution for this would be to sanitize the file in order to ensure no XSS is possible and to stop getting the error. \r\n\r\nSo, I tried using the sanitize function as the following:\r\n`const sanitizedURL = this.domSanitizer.sanitize(`\r\n`SecurityContext.URL /* context to sanitize */,`\r\n`unsafeURL);`\r\n\r\nHowever, this wouldn't work. I still get the same error. \r\n\r\nI searched online and everyone kept saying to use the bypassSecurityTrustUrl function, which I did. I sanitized the file using sanitize function then went along and passed it to the bypassSecurityTrustUrl to inform it that it's safe URL. However, it still wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nThe only way for me to get rid of the error is to use bypassSecurityTrustUrl on the un-sanitized URL of the file, which doesn't really make sense. This will still make my app vulnerable to XSS attacks.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to follow the safe approach for this, but it feels like I'm being forced to use bypassSecurityTrustUrl on it's own for it to work, which is not the behavior I want as that URL is always from the user.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nWARNING: sanitizing unsafe URL\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.7\r\nNode: 8.9.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.7\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/cdk-experimental         7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/platform-server          7.2.15\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.0.8\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.7\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.8.3\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Forced to use bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl to avoid getting (WARNING: sanitizing unsafe URL)\" (#31361)"},{"Id":"462374044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-30T12:01:23","Actor":"denis-itskovich","Number":"31357","RawContent":null,"Title":"Injection by the equivalent (but not same instance) of the InjectionToken does not work","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n`@angular/core`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNot sure\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen provider defines binding for `InjectionToken` (rather than for Type), the injection can be made only with the same instance of `InjectionToken`.

This has highlighted that this class is tightly coupled to process.cwd and that this should instead be passed as an argument.\r\n\r\n**More details**\r\n \r\nClass NodeModulesEngineHost. Whilst methods _resolvePackageJson, _resolvePath accept a path to be provided, _resolveCollectionPath uses process.cwd() when calling them. This means that this class will always use the processes current working directory to identify schematics.\r\n\r\nInstead, in my opinion, the class that creates the NodeModulesEngineHost should provide the baseDir. i.e. add (private path: string) to the constructor and then update the cli implementations to pass the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14935","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NodeModuleEngineHost tightly coupled to process working directory\" (#14935)"},{"Id":"461942044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-28T09:23:13","Actor":"hugodes","Number":"14933","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bazel opt in : ng add @angular/bazel fails","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ x ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI followed the steps [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CZsABQJDjpBLun5Ewk3lNUTAHX2Y-pUb3-dfLMZ22DE/preview?slide=id.g568f4cb48a_1_7) for using Bazel in out existing application and got this error:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng add @angular/bazel\r\nUnable to find compatible package.

The most common case that I have seen is that developers want to tweak the contrast colors of a specific theme. \r\n1. However, it is also common to need to change just 1 or 2 colors, in an existing palette, slightly to match company branding.\r\n1. In some cases, there is a need to create a completely custom palette, or set of palettes, for use in an application with highly custom theming.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\n`ng g @angular/material:palette --base=mat-blue --path=src/styles.scss my-blue`\r\n\r\nThis would inject the following into `src/styles.scss` immediately after `@include mat-core();`:\r\n```scss\r\n$my-blue: (\r\n  50: #e3f2fd,\r\n  100: #bbdefb,\r\n  200: #90caf9,\r\n  300: #64b5f6,\r\n  400: #42a5f5,\r\n  500: #2196f3,\r\n  600: #1e88e5,\r\n  700: #1976d2,\r\n  800: #1565c0,\r\n  900: #0d47a1,\r\n  A100: #82b1ff,\r\n  A200: #448aff,\r\n  A400: #2979ff,\r\n  A700: #2962ff,\r\n  contrast: (\r\n    50: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    100: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    200: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    300: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    400: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    500: $light-primary-text,\r\n    600: $light-primary-text,\r\n    700: $light-primary-text,\r\n    800: $light-primary-text,\r\n    900: $light-primary-text,\r\n    A100: $dark-primary-text,\r\n    A200: $light-primary-text,\r\n    A400: $light-primary-text,\r\n    A700: $light-primary-text,\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would still be up to the developer to actually use the palette in defining a theme (i.e. `$app-primary: mat-palette($my-blue);`).\r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16416.\r\nRelated [Custom theming Docs](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-custom-theme).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16417","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"schematic(theme): inject a palette definition for customization\" (#16417)"},{"Id":"462877814","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-01T19:39:17","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"16416","RawContent":null,"Title":"schematic(theme): migrate project from prebuilt to custom theme","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\nThis actually came in through the Angular CLI feedback survey, but there is interest in having a `ng generate` schematic for migrating an app using a prebuilt theme to the custom theme configuration that `ng add` already supports.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\nMany times at `ng add` time, users don't know why they would need a custom theme or don't know that they will need one. There are a number of gotchas and ways to get implementing a custom theme wrong. Having a schematic for this would help streamline that experience and fits well without our goals for Angular Material schematics.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that a good deal of our existing `ng add` logic for adding a custom theme could be re-used. It looks like the `ng add` logic already handles things like adding a custom theme to a project that only uses CSS (it adds a `custom-theme.scss` file and then adds that to the `styles` array in the `angular.json`).\r\n\r\nThere may be a need to allow the caller to point to the files where they import their prebuilt theme, as they may have moved it out of `src/styles.scss`.

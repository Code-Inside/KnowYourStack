As a result, projected node was missing `ngProjectAs` attribute as well as other attributes added after `ngProjectAs` one. This is problematic since app code might rely on the presence of `ngProjectAs` attribute (for example in CSS). This commit fixes the problem by including `ngProjectAs` into attributes array as a regular attribute and also makes sure that the parsed version of the `ngProjectAs` attribute with a special marker is added after regular attributes (thus we set them correctly at runtime). This change also aligns View Engine and Ivy behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-1562.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32784","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): include `ngProjectAs` into attributes array\" (#32784)"},{"Id":"496082102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-20T00:17:28","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"32783","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Turn on strict mode for test project","State":"open","Body":"This is the last part in refactoring of the test project.\r\nThis PR turns on strict mode for typechecking and fixed tests that\r\nfail under this mode.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The reason for this seems to be the fact that ivy is now the default and no `ngsummary.json` files are created by `ngc` with the postinstall script (`ngc -p ./angular-metadata.tsconfig.json`). We can solve this by modifying `angular-metadata.tsconfig.json` to disable ivy: \r\n<pre><code>\r\n\"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"enableIvy\": false\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNow `ngsummary.json` files are created. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this gives us another exception.\r\n<pre><code>\r\nError: Could not resolve ./router.ngfactory from /home/broken/.cache/bazel/_bazel_broken/a989ca7319030786eb94b60dd781e6a5/execroot/project/external/npm/node_modules/@angular/router/router.d.ts\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nCan't figure out why, `router.ngfactory.js` is indeed there. But maybe it want's a .ts?\r\nFull stop. \r\n\r\n2. Ivy don't want/care about `ngsummary.json` files. \r\n\r\nThen i really don't know.

Description\r\nIvy incorrectly identifies interfaces as unused that compose parts of an object returned from an API endpoint. i.e. Type A that contains Type B, if Type B is never assigned to and is in it's own TS file, Ivy generates warnings that Type B is not an entry point.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds:\r\n\r\n- Move the interface into the same file as the parent object interface.\r\n- Inline the child interface into the parent interface rather than defining a new type.\r\n- Define A.B as \\<any> rather than strongly typing it.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal

Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.28.0...0.29.0)\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n`ts_library` strict dependencies now apply to libraries from npm.\nYou can use `deps=[\"@&#8203;npm//:node_modules\"]` to depend on all node_modules, but this has performance implications.\nWe suggest adding missing dependencies individually to the `deps` of the `ts_library`, following guidance from the compile errors.\n\n### Changes\n\nNew `check_bazel_version_range` function to ensure your team uses the Bazel version you require\n\nWe automatically generate a named UMD bundle at `@npm//node_modules/package:package.umd.js` so that the concatjs bundler can work with third-party libraries.\n\n`ts_library` now automatically gathers typings from npm packages in the `deps`.\n\n`web_package`\n\n-   Support the same root paths as `ts_devserver`, fix for [#&#8203;728](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/728)\n\n`rollup_bundle`\n\n-   now includes the json plugin\n-   bugfix for downleveling\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains</summary>\n\n###

Create a new project.\r\n```\r\nnpx -p @angular/cli@8.3.3 ng new es5-support\r\n```\r\n2. Change the browsers list file to consider IE 9-11 (remove `not` as suggested in the comments):\r\n```\r\n> 0.5%\r\nlast 2 versions\r\nFirefox ESR\r\nnot dead\r\nIE 9-11\r\n```\r\n3. Create a custom script that uses, for example, Promises:\r\n```\r\nconst myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve) {\r\n  setTimeout(function(){\r\n    resolve('Promise resolved');\r\n  }, 500);\r\n});\r\n\r\nmyPromise.then(console.log);\r\n```\r\n4. Add this script to the build target (angular.json):\r\n```\r\n... \r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"outputPath\": \"dist/es5-support\",\r\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\r\n            \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n            \"polyfills\": \"src/polyfills.ts\",\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n            \"aot\": false,\r\n            \"assets\": [\r\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n              \"src/assets\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"styles\": [\r\n              \"src/styles.css\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"scripts\": [\r\n              \"my-script.js\"\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n... \r\n```\r\n5. Build the application:\r\n```\r\nng build --prod\r\n```\r\n6. Deploy and run the application on IE11. \r\n\r\nHere is a repo that reproduces the error: https://github.com/cladera/ng-cli-es5-support\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nSCRIPT5009: 'Promise' is undefined\r\nFile: scripts.31a5e5bdf3ecf1f1be1c.js, Line: 1, Column: 1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.4\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.4\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.4\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.4\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIf I run the build with the environment flag `NG_BUILD_DIFFERENTIAL_FULL` set to `1` it runs a build that does work on IE 11. \r\n\r\nAnyway, one may wonder why do I need to add a script to my application that may break it whatsoever. Well, in an ideal world, all the libraries I need would be full UMD/cmjs compatible and I may just import them as a normal vendor dependency. But sadly, that's not my case. I need to add some scripts as \"global\" because I'm forced to do it. My point is, this worked fine few minor versions ago and now it doesn't which in my opinion is a breaking change.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"older (es5) browsers not fully supported when using workspace scripts\" (#15625)"},{"Id":"495114999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-18T09:49:57","Actor":"indraraj26","Number":"15624","RawContent":null,"Title":"Invalid Host/Origin header [WDS] Disconnected!","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes it was working fine in 7.3.x\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Whenever i make any changes in file and then see web browser console. it is spamming continuously with client:169 Invalid Host/Origin header \r\nclient:172 [WDS] Disconnected!\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n```\r\nAngular is running in the development mode.

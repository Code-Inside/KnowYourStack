Supporting these options would allow developers to fine-tune request behavior, improve resource loading strategies, and enhance performance for critical assets.\n\n## Motivation / Use Cases  \nThe `cache` and `priority` options are useful for:\n\n- **`cache`**: Enables control over cache behavior (e.g., `'no-store'`, `'reload'`, `'force-cache'`) to prevent unnecessary network calls or force fresh data.\n- **`priority`**: Allows specifying fetch priority (`'high'`, `'low'`, `'auto'`) to improve performance metrics like LCP by prioritizing critical resources.\n\nPriority improve performance https://web.dev/articles/fetch-priority\n\nExample scenarios:\n- Force reload of time-sensitive data (`cache: 'reload'`)\n- Prioritize hero images or essential scripts (`priority: 'high'`)\n- Deprioritize below-the-fold or non-blocking assets (`priority: 'low'`)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- Add `cache` and `priority` to the `HttpRequestInit` interface.\n- Implement support for these properties in the `HttpRequest` class.\n- Pass both options through `FetchBackend` to the native Fetch API.\n- Ensure full backward compatibility with current usage of `HttpClient`.\n\nProposed \n\n```ts\nhttp.get('/assets/hero-image.jpg', {\n  cache : 'force-cache' , \n  priority : 'high'\n});\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI can't find any documentation or way to use it according to angular.dev","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request : Expose `cache` and `Priority` option in HttpClient Fetch API\" (#61765)"},{"Id":"3101897403","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T02:09:43","Actor":"shawal-mbalire","Number":"61764","RawContent":null,"Title":"Failed Build with v20","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI sucessfully updated to angular version 20. \nbut when I try to build I get a message that my version does not support ng build\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caabb7fa-a6de-4fa3-a3b7-db926907f5d9)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nNode.js version v23.11.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

During the migration process, the Angular CLI encountered the following error:\n\n`Migration failed: require() of ES Module /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/ora/index.js from /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js not supported.\nInstead change the require of index.js in /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.`\n\n## Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Run the command `ng new dealer-client` to create a new Angular project.\n2. Notice that this creates the project using Angular **19.2** (despite specifying Angular 20).\n3. Run the command `ng update @angular/core@20 @angular/cli@20` to upgrade the Angular CLI and dependencies to version 20.\n4. During the migration process, the error is triggered when the migration reaches the step for updating application projects to the new build system.\n\n## Expected Behavior:\n\nThe update and migration process should complete successfully without errors, including any optional migration tasks like updating the build system.\n\n## Actual Behavior:\n\nThe migration fails with the following error message:\n\nMigration failed: require() of ES Module /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/ora/index.js from /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js not supported.\n\n## Possible Cause:\n\nThe error seems related to the attempt to `require()` an ES module (`ora/index.js`) from a CommonJS context. It appears that the current migration process might not be fully compatible with ES modules, which causes the failure.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n- This issue may be related to specific Node.js versions or dependency versions, so any additional insights into handling ES module compatibility in the migration process would be helpful.\n- I have attempted to perform the migration using both a clean setup and an existing project, with the same result.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n```true\nSelect the migrations that you'd like to run [use-application-builder] Migrate application projects to the new build system.

I'm not sure if I’ve missed a configuration step or if this is expected behavior.\n\nHowever, in the Vite ecosystem, when using the option to externalize dependencies, all the CSS is correctly resolved, but the JavaScript is excluded from the import.\n\n```js\nexport default defineConfig((env) => {\n  return {\n    build: {\n      rollupOptions: {\n        external: [\"bootstrap\"],\n      },\n    },\n});\n```\n\nHowever, in the Angular environment, this approach causes the build to fail because it can't locate the CSS.\n\n```json\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"test-angular\": {\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"externalDependencies\": [\"bootstrap\"],\n```\n\nTo isolate the issue, I created a minimal reproduction using Bootstrap.\n\nThank you very much for the awesome work 🚀 \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/Tragio/angular-externalize-repro\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n> ng build\n\nApplication bundle generation failed.

[`v20.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-2025-05-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-rc.3...20.0.0)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   Using the `Y` formatter (week-numbering year) without also including `w` (week number) is now detected as suspicious date pattern, as `y` is typically intended.\n-   `AsyncPipe` now directly catches unhandled errors in\n    subscriptions and promises and reports them to the application's\n    `ErrorHandler`. For Zone-based applications, these errors would have\n    been caught by ZoneJS and reported to `ErrorHandler` so the result is\n    generally the same. The change to the exact mechanism for reporting can\n    result in differences in test environments that will require test\n    updates.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   'in' in an expression now refers to the operator\n-   `void` in an expression now refers to the operator\n\n    Previously an expression in the template like `{{void}}` referred to a\n    property on the component class. After this change it now refers to the\n    `void` operator, which would make the above example invalid. If you have\n    existing expressions that need to refer to a property named `void`,\n    change the expression to use `this.void` instead: `{{this.void}}`.\n\n##### core\n\n-   TypeScript versions less than 5.8 are no longer supported.\n-   the `TestBed.flushEffects()` was removed - use\n    the `TestBed.tick()` instead.\n-   `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` has several\n    breaking changes:\n    -   It is renamed to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig`\n    -   The behavior applies to *all* checkNoChanges runs\n    -   The `useNgZoneOnStable` option is removed. This wasn't found to be generally\n        more useful than `interval`\n-   `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is\n    renamed to `provideZonelessChangeDetection` as it is now \"Developer\n    Preview\" rather than \"Experimental\".\n-   -   `InjectFlags` has been removed.\n    -   `inject` no longer accepts `InjectFlags`.\n    -   `Injector.get` no longer accepts `InjectFlags`.\n    -   `EnvironmentInjector.get` no longer accepts `InjectFlags`.\n    -   `TestBed.get` no longer accepts `InjectFlags`.\n    -   `TestBed.inject` no longer accepts `InjectFlags`.\n-   -   `TestBed.get` has been removed. Use `TestBed.inject` instead.\n-   afterRender was renamed to afterEveryRender.\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\n-   `PendingTasks.run` no longer returns the result of the\n    async function. If this behavior is desired, it can be re-implemented\n    manually with the `PendingTasks.add`. Be aware, however, that promise rejections\n    will need to be handled or they can cause the node process to shut down\n    when using SSR.\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n-   The `any` overload has been removed from\n    `injector.get`. It now only supports `ProviderToken<T>` and (deprecated\n    since v4) `string`.\n-   Animations are guaranteed to be flushed when Angular\n    runs automatic change detection or manual calls to `ApplicationRef.tick`.\n    Prior to this change, animations would not be flushed in some situations\n    if change detection did not run on any views attached to the\n    application. This change can affect tests which may rely on the old\n    behavior, often by making assertions on DOM elements that should have\n    been removed but weren't because DOM removal is delayed until animations\n    are flushed.\n-   `ApplicationRef.tick` will no longer catch and report\n    errors to the appplication `ErrorHandler`. Errors will instead be thrown out of\n    the method and will allow callers to determine how to handle these\n    errors, such as aborting follow-up work or reporting the error and\n    continuing.\n-   This commit deprecates `ng-reflect-*` attributes and updates the runtime to stop producing them by default. Please refactor application and test code to avoid relying on `ng-reflect-*` attributes.\n\n    To enable a more seamless upgrade to v20, we've added the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function (can be imported from the `@angular/core` package), which enables the mode in which Angular would be producing those attribites (in dev mode only). You can add the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function to the list of providers within the bootstrap call.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RedirectFn` can now return `Observable` or\n    `Promise`. Any code that directly calls functions returning this type\n    may need to be adjusted to account for this.\n-   Several methods in the public API of the Router which\n    required writable arrays have now been updated to accept readonly\n    arrays when no mutations are done.\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\n    `Injector.get`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   All entries of the `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`\n-   HammerJS support is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   `@angular/platform-server/testing`\n\n    Use e2e tests to verify SSR behavior instead.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type |

scroll 'flickering' with zoneless","State":"open","Body":"This fixes the perceived flickering due to the transform sometimes becoming visible with zoneless due to the macrotask-based scheduler. The transform cannot be simply moved inside `afterNextRender` because it causes differences in timing that can break certain scroll implementations (http://b/335066372).\r\n\r\nThis approach fiddles with the details of `ngZone.run` and avoiding unnecessary extra ApplicationRef.tick calls. We could instead put everything inside an ngZone.run and call ApplicationRef.tick in there, but that would result in a second tick when the `ngZone.run` exits.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31240","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/scrolling): Prevent virtual scroll 'flickering' with zoneless\" (#31240)"},{"Id":"3097498032","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T14:04:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31239","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.18 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31239","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.18 release\" (#31239)"},{"Id":"3097491610","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T13:56:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31238","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.18\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31238","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.18\" with changelog.\" (#31238)"},{"Id":"3097085207","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T11:52:25","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31236","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/expansion): align state layer colors","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31236","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/expansion): align state layer colors\" (#31236)"},{"Id":"3094915337","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T07:59:10","Actor":"farzambabar","Number":"31233","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(code) Unable to run locally - No matching toolchains found for types @rules_sass//src/toolchain:toolchain_type","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n\"Hi, I have cloned the repository (https://github.com/angular/components), ran pnpm install, and then executed pnpm dev-app. I'm facing an issue while running it on Windows.\"\n\nERROR: No matching toolchains found for types @rules_sass//src/toolchain:toolchain_type\n\nDETAIL: Analyzing: target //src/dev-app:devserver (0 packages loaded, 0 targets configured) ERROR: D:/project/open_source/components/src/dev-app/BUILD.bazel:123:12: While resolving toolchains for target //src/dev-app:theme: No matching toolchains found for types @rules_sass//src/toolchain:toolchain_type.

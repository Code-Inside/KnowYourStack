When using ZoneJS, these listeners are most often executed in the Angular Zone as well, so synchronization (`ApplicationRef.tick`) will eventually happen. _However_, developers can opt out of zone-patching for events in several ways, and often do this for very frequent listeners like `mousemove`, `resize`, and `scroll`. We do not want to break existing expectations that these are now \"safe\" events to have listeners for by automatically scheduling change detection regardless of whether the listener executed inside or outside the Angular zone.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in order for developers to more easily transition to zoneless, we need to be able to ensure that components which are using `OnPush` are, for the most part, compatible with zoneless as well. Because listeners automatically mark the component for check, developers using `OnPush` did not/do not need to also call `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck` or a similar API. Unfortunately, this means that we need to consider the listener callbacks as a notification to schedule a `tick` when Zoneless is enabled. In the future, we would like to have an opt-out for this (i.e. signal components) since it's not really how we _want_ things to work.\r\n\r\nAlso includes the fix for #54919 that got reverted only because it was easier to revert the set of conflicting commits\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55525","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): Omit listeners from out-of-zone scheduling when using…\" (#55525)"},{"Id":"2262333438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:36:00","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"55524","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert of a few recent commits","State":"closed","Body":"Reason for rollback - g3 failures.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55524","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert of a few recent commits\" (#55524)"},{"Id":"2262329816","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:07:52","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"55523","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core:) Move action resolution into a standalone class.","State":"open","Body":"This refactor will enable moving this functionality into the dispatcher.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Each listing has different images setup, and I see that when `<img>` is inside of the `<picture>` element directly, without usage of template outlet, lazy loading works fine. \r\nBut if there is `<ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"tmpImg\"></ng-container>` that loads `<img>` tag instead of placing `<img>` directly - lazy loading doesn't work. \r\nAlso, if `<img>` is placed directly inside of `<picture>`, but has `*ngIf` attribute on `<img>`, lazy loading also doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhen the hydration is enabled - image lazy loading is working for all scenarios.\r\n\r\nFull html could be

Now, `_variables.scss` will automatically import `_variables-dark.scss`. If you were already importing `_variables-dark.scss` manually, you should keep doing it as it won't break anything and will be the way to go in v6.\n-   Fixed a regression in the selector engine that wasn't able to handle multiple IDs anymore.\n\n#### Color modes\n\n-   Badges now use the `.text-bg-*` text utilities to be certain that the text is always readable (especially when the customized colors are different in light and dark modes).\n-   Fixed our `color-modes.js` script to handle the case where the OS is set to light mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from our docs, you should apply [this change](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/73e1dcf43eff8371dde52ce41bd1d9fdc2b47d1f) to your own script.\n-   Fixed color schemes description in the color modes documentation to show that `color-scheme()` only accept `light` and `dark` values as parameters.\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\n-   Allowed `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>` in the sanitizer.\n-   Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers.\n-   Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions.\n-   Fixed the focus box-shadow for the validation stated form controls.\n-   Fixed the focus ring on focused checked buttons.\n-   Fixed the product example mobile navbar toggler.\n-   Changed the RTL processing of

[devDependencies](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adependencies+project%3Atwbs%2F32+is%3Aclosed)\n\n### [`v5.3.2`](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v5.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/compare/v5.3.1...v5.3.2)\n\n#### Highlights\n\n-   Passing a percentage unit to the global `abs()` is deprecated since Dart Sass v1.65.0. It resulted in a deprecation warning when compiling Bootstrap with Dart Sass. This has been fixed internally by changing the values passed to the `divide()` function. The `divide()` function has not been fixed itself so that we can keep supporting node-sass cross-compatibility. In v6, this won't be an issue as we plan to drop support for node-sass.\n-   Using multiple `id`s in a collapse target wasn't working anymore and has been fixed.\n\n#### Color modes\n\n-   Increased color contrast of form range track background in light and dark modes.\n-   Fixed table state rendering for color modes with a focus on the striped table in dark mode to increase color contrast.\n-   Allow `<mark>` color customization for color modes.\n\n#### Docs\n\n-   Added alternative CDNs section in [Getting started -> Download](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/#alternative-cdns).\n-   Added Discord and Bootstrap subreddit links in [README](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/README.md) and [Getting started -> Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/):\n    -

manually.\r\n\r\nSometimes we somehow use ESNext features like Array.prototype.flatMap but forget adding its polyfill into polyfills.ts, it accidentally breaks on some browsers.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/alauda, we are using [@alauda/custom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alauda/custom-webpack) which pipes babel-loader after @ngtools/webpack in webpack config, so that we get auto polyfilling successfully via @babel/preset-env.\r\n\r\nSo I'm suggesting to add auto polyfilling support into @angular/cli.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf we can build all .ts via @ngtools/webpack with targeting esnext, then we can use babel to compiling all ES syntaxes totally but are able to get types metadata still at the same time.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27510","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[reopen] [proposal] auto polyfilling support via @babel/preset-env\"

This seems to happen because the \"_siblings\" are created at drag initiation and do not notice if a row is created at runtime. It start working after a few drop list exit or enter but not if you directly go to that drop list.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have this feature?\r\nOr if it is already possible could you tell me how to do it?\r\nFor the moment I solved it by adding this method to my code, but it seems to me a very dirty solution.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprivate refreshDropLists() {\r\n    // do it only if the component rows and the library rows are not sync\r\n    if (this.dropLists.toArray().length === this.configuration.length) {\r\n      // loop over the droplists\r\n      this.dropLists.toArray().forEach((dropList) => {\r\n        // force to recalculate the row positions\r\n        // @ts-ignore\r\n        dropList._dropListRef._cacheParentPositions();\r\n        // force the link between each row except for the row itself\r\n        dropList._dropListRef.connectedTo(\r\n          this.dropLists\r\n            .toArray()\r\n            .filter((dropList2) => dropList.id !== dropList2.id)\r\n            .map((droplist2) => droplist2._dropListRef)\r\n        );\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAn example can be viewed at the following link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-7xvrf3?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nIf you want to make it work where to uncomment line 30 and 31 of the file \"app.component.ts\"\n\n### Use Case\n\nA useful use case would be, as with the linked stackblitz, creating a new droplists from the element I am dragging.\r\nSo if I have as in my case a structure of rows and columns, I want to be able to drag my column to a new row that doesn't exist.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdk/drag-drop): Allow dynamic drop lists creation while dragging an item\" (#28958)"},{"Id":"2261695714","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-24T16:21:41","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28955","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/theming): remove shadow from system tokens","State":"open","Body":"Switching the `shadow` token to point to a css variable breaks box-shadows for at least one component (card) but likely breaks elevation in general across all components.\n\nOur box-shadows are generated by calling MDC mixin(s?) which expect the shadow color to be in a specific format.

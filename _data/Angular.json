Here is a code example that exposes the reason the inference is incorrect. It exploits the fact that Typescript will not \"un-distribute\" a type, producing an obviously spurious error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// fc gets an inferred distributive union type `FormControl<string> | FormControl<number>`\r\nlet fc = c.controls.foo;\r\n// Error: Type 'FormControl<string | number>' is not assignable to type 'FormControl<string> | FormControl<number>'.\r\nfc = new FormControl<string|number>('', {initialValueIsDefault: true});\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we want the union to apply to the *values*:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// `foo` should have type `FormControl<string|number>`.\r\nconst c = fb.nonNullable.group({foo: 'bar' as string | number});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, we want to prevent Typescript from distributing the type. The [handbook suggests a solution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#distributive-conditional-types) when distributivity is not wanted:\r\n\r\n> Typically, distributivity is the desired behavior.

The behavior only occurs when using a redirect route.\r\n\r\nConsider an application with these two routes:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  { path: 'page2/:id', component: Page2Component },\r\n  { path: 'page2', redirectTo: '/page2/', pathMatch: 'full' },\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, in the same app, a page with these links with `routerLinkActive`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n      <a \r\n        routerLink=\"/page2\" \r\n        routerLinkActive=\"active\"\r\n        [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\">Page 2</a>\r\n\r\n      <a routerLink=\"/page2/foo\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">Page 2 / Foo</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the first link (/page2) to be have the `active` class only when the url is `/active` and not when the url is `/active/foo`. However, when I have the `redirect` route shown above, the first link never gets the `active` class applied to it. This is true regardless of whether I add a trailing slash to the routerLink or not (i.e. `routerLink=\"/page2/foo/\"`).\r\n\r\nIt does work as expected if, instead of the redirect route, I just have a second route as follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  { path: 'page2/:id', component: Page2Component },\r\n  { path: 'page2', component: Page2Component },\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to be a better practice to use the redirect route, because then the component does not get re-loaded when navigating to itself from itself (i.e. navigating from `/page2/foo` to `/page2/bar`). So I'd prefer the redirect route, but I can't see how to get the `[routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\"` working when using a redirect route.\r\n\r\nHere are examples in stackblitz:\r\n\r\nBroken example with redirect route: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ii1882?file=src/app/app.module.ts\r\n\r\nWorking example with non-redirect route: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-rh1tj1?file=src/app/app.module.ts\r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or is there a solution I'm not seeing that would allow me to have both a redirect route and a working `routerLinkActiveOptions`?\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ii1882?file=src/app/app.module.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo, exception. Of course, without the redirect route, I do get an `Error: Cannot match any routes.

`x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] build\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo, didn't work in previous versions as mentioned but not properly solved here #4782 or here #18043\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Description & Minimal Reproduction\r\n1) `ng new test-app`\r\n2) Place a picture in `src/assets`\r\n\r\n**_We have to look at 2 different build environments:_**\r\n\r\n#### 1) Default dev env with `ng serve`\r\nThe default base-href is `<base href=\"/\"></base>`, which means all URIs don't have a prefix and have the default root.\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Status |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n|`<img src=\"/assets/img.png\" />` | works, but ignores the base-href |\r\n|`<img src=\"assets/img.png\" />` | works, is relative path from the root |\r\n|`background-imge: url('/assets/img.png')` | works, but ignores the base-href |\r\n|`background-imge: url('assets/img.png')` | works not |\r\n|`background-imge: url('~src/assets/img.png')` | works, why?? |\r\n\r\n####  2) Serving a production build using a webserver like nginx or apache\r\nNow we set the base-href to `<base href=\"/app/\"></base>` in index.html and set in **angular.json** `\"baseHref\": \"/app/\",` in `architect/configurations/production` and run `ng build`.\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Status |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| `<img src=\"/assets/img.png\" />`      | works not, because we have /app/ prefix after root       |\r\n| `<img src=\"assets/img.png\" />`   | works, path is updated to /app/assets/img.png by compiler        |\r\n| `<img src=\"./assets/img.png\" />`   | same as above        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('/assets/img.png')`   |  works not, because we have /app/ prefix after root        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('./assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('~src/assets/img.png')`   | ~~works not~~   **update: works**     |\r\n| `background-imge: url('~assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('/app/assets/img.png')`   | works, but uses root routing and breaks dev env  |\r\n\r\n**TLDR:**\r\nThere is no way to access asset files in SCSS with a changed base-href, without hardcoding the base-href in SCSS like `/app/assets/img.png` but breaking the local dev env.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./src/app/elements/phone-frame/phone-frame.component.scss?ngResource -

relevant?**\r\nThe truth is I don't know much about updating node projects. I think this update tool has worked for me in the past but most of the time I just \"rebase\" my code onto a new project. I'm used to spring boot where to get everything updated I have to copy/paste one or two versions belonging to \"bom\" bill of material dependencies that set the version for everything else transitively. When I run `ng update` or `npm audit fix --force` what is it trying to do? Every time I read an error from one of these things I feel like I need a visual aid to figure out which version is too far up or down from where the other versions want them to be.\r\n`ng update` proposed that everything be set to 13.3.6/13.3.5. That sounded good. How is 14.0.0-next.16 entering the picture? I certainly didn't add it. Is there a full proof guide for everything I need to do to update things and make the vulnerabilities go away?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23102","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng update says there are incompatible peer dependencies\" (#23102)"},{"Id":"1228863464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-08T11:29:11","Actor":"sixcorners","Number":"23101","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update says it checked package.json but it seems that can be misleading","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> no\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> ng update says that it checked package.json but if you take an old project, update the dependencies, npm install, then go back to the old package.json versions it will say that all the versions are fine.

As you know it is non trivial to resize the elements, is there any way to apply some setting to make things the same size as on the angular material website?  By way of example here are some screenshots, taken from the same browser just my page versus angular page: Note the \"+1\" in the screenshot is a <mat-mini-fab> but renders larger than the <mat-fab> shown on your website.\r\nSimilar issues with other controls: (\"Binding Type\" is in a  <mat-card-title> element and the text below is <mat-card-subtitle> -- compare to screenshot taken from the material website of a mat card with a title and subtitle.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 2 13 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846394-62349276-4988-4c1c-b8d8-93e8dde88cbe.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846597-28ff5250-352a-446e-9ad1-397d2e8f34ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nNo idea how to approach this.

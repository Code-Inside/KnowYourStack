It addition, the idea of automatically creating the vitest configuration based on 'angular.json' might not provide all the flexibility, but it provides some significant other benefits:\n\n1. No duplication between 'vitest.config.ts' and 'angular.json'\n2. Future proofing in case of any additional test runner migrations\n\nUnfortunately, not all required configuration options were available through 'angular.json' at this point. As a result, here are the changes that I had to temporarily make in \"node_modules\\@angular\\build\\src\\builders\\unit-test\\builder.js\":\n\n1. Changed the mock configuration to automatically restore spies.\n`test.restoreMocks: true`\n This simulates the Jasmine default behavior and would simplify the migration process from Karma. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json' and default to true.\n2. Changed the default coverage reporter\n`test.coverage.reporter: 'html'`\nThis removes the default 'text' reporter, which sends the coverage report to the terminal while providing code coverage information within the Vitest UI. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'.\n3. Changed the browser configuration for some use cases\n`browser.headless: true`\nHowever, both configurations ('true' and 'false') are being used. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'.\n4. Changed the browser configuration\n`browser.instances.viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }`\nIdeally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'. Specifically, the browser configuration should not be performed with the current array of browser names but instead with an array of [browser instances](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/config.html#browser-instances).\n\nBesides the above configuration options, the automatically generated 'vite.config.ts' should also be made available to be used by other tools like the [Vitest Extension for VS Code](https://vitest.dev/guide/ide)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nMissing configuration options for real projects\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                              Version\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect            0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core                 20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics           20.0.0\n@angular/cdk                         20.0.1\n@angular/material                    20.0.1\n@angular/material-date-fns-adapter   20.0.1\n@schematics/angular                  20.0.0\nrxjs                                 7.8.2\ntypescript                           5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30478","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/build:unit-test omits configuration options\" (#30478)"},{"Id":"3121883991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:45:35","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"30476","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency io_bazel_rules_webtesting to v0.4.0","State":"closed","Body":"Forked off https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30465, as `@rules_webtesting` seems to have changed its URL format.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30476","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dependency io_bazel_rules_webtesting to v0.4.0\" (#30476)"},{"Id":"3121849955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:24:28","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"30474","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix perf workflows","State":"closed","Body":"[610a36702ef3d7867bef70b0403f0847c5e3904b](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/610a36702ef3d7867bef70b0403f0847c5e3904b) renamed some test targets and broke these references.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30474","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix perf workflows\" (#30474)"},{"Id":"3121916489","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:11:13","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"30477","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30477","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#30477)"},{"Id":"3118729258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T16:46:11","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"30463","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bumping dependencies for `20.1.0-next`","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30463","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: bumping dependencies for `20.1.0-next`\" (#30463)"},{"Id":"3119853141","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T16:43:38","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30465","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency io_bazel_rules_webtesting to v0.4.0 -","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [io_bazel_rules_webtesting](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/rules_webtesting) | http_archive | minor | `0.3.5` -> `0.4.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_webtesting (io_bazel_rules_webtesting)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/rules_webtesting/releases/tag/0.4.0): Release rules_webtesting 0.4.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/rules_webtesting/compare/0.3.5...0.4.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Most of cases in Angular SSR is done with Lambda in AWS, using cloudfront functions, which are connected as well to the a S3 bucket. Now the S3 bucket can serve a static page or resource in case when SSR is not needed, and for the rest of the pages that need SSR request get redirect to lambda and are handled there.\n\nWith this breaking change, I notice today that all my static pages were not working when SSR was turned off, because normally CloudFront (but it is same for CDN providers) will just serve the content from an S3 bucket pointing at `/`, which in this case broke because the index.html did not exists anymore.\n\nThis change needs to be reverted. It is no sense that index.csr.html is renamed by angular CLI, if a developer needs to rename it, can very well do it manually in the deployment procedure.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nJust create a minimal SSR angular app\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nindex.csr.html is procuded by default\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n19\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No

When I try using matButton, Angular throws an error saying the directive is not recognized.\n\nI believe this might be confusing for new users and could lead to unnecessary debugging. Could the docs be updated to clarify that the correct usage in templates is mat-button, not matButton?\n\nThanks for the amazing work on Angular!\n\nBest regards,\n\nTiago M.

The anchor differs from the placeholder in that it will stay in the original container and won't move to any subsequent containers.\r\n\r\nFixes #13906.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31288","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/drag-drop): add opt-in indicator of pick-up position\" (#31288)"},{"Id":"3117236859","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T09:57:55","Actor":"lmuraru-plenty","Number":"31289","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tree): childrenAccessor is not lazily evaluated and leaf nodes are not filtered out before calling the childrenAccessor","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`childrenAccessor` should only be called when expanding a node.\n\nIn the current state, workarounds are needed to support a mat-tree which asynchronously fetches children.

This is a useful feature in many real-world use cases such as:\n\nRestricting booking or appointment times (e.g., between 9 AM and 5 PM)\n\nPreventing selection of past or future times depending on business rules\n\nAligning with form validation and disabling invalid options in the UI\n\n### Use Case\n\nThe proposed minTime and maxTime feature would enable developers to restrict user input to specific time ranges directly through the UI. This is especially useful in scenarios such as:\n\nAppointment Scheduling:\n\nAllow users to select times only during business hours (e.g., 09:00–17:00).\n\nPrevent booking outside working hours or during system maintenance windows.\n\nForm Validation Consistency:\n\nAlign timepicker constraints with backend validation rules.\n\nEnsure users can’t select invalid times that would be rejected by the API.\n\nTime-based Access Control:\n\nLimit actions (e.g., fund transfers or reservations) to certain hours of the day.\n\nPrevent users from interacting with restricted services outside allowed times.\n\nEnhanced User Experience:\n\nDisable irrelevant time options directly in the timepicker dropdown.\n\nReduce form submission errors by guiding the user to valid selections.\n\nThese are common real-world use cases in banking apps, healthcare scheduling, logistics portals, etc., and currently require complex custom logic or third-party solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(MatTimepicker): support minTime and maxTime inputs similar to MatDatepicker\" (#31273)"},{"Id":"3107215715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T12:55:22","Actor":"jjalbuenacabuyao","Number":"31271","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog): dialog's container-color does not follow Material 3 design specs","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a bug in the Angular Material dialog component where dialog uses `surface` container-color instead of `surface-container-high` as per Material 3 guidelines.\r\n\r\nFixes #30536","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31271","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/dialog): dialog's container-color does not follow Material 3 design specs\" (#31271)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-06T03:30:02.9522475Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1645}

That's only one possible strategy, other could try to reuse already present controls etc.\r\n// I am aware that this could be aproached in few ways\r\n\r\n  // we cannot simply do \r\n  // this.formArray.setValue(data) \r\n // because we don't have form groups in form arrays so again\r\n\r\n this.formArray.clear()\r\n for (companyBranchData of data) {\r\n  formArray.push(createCompanyBranchDetailsFormGroup(companyBranchData )) \r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncreateCompanyBranchDetailsFormGroup(companyBranchData: ComanyBranchDetails) {\r\nconst contactDetailsFromArray = new FormArray<ContactDetailsForm>([]);\r\n\r\n for (contactDetail of companyBranchData.contactDetails) {\r\n  contactDetailsFromArray .push(createContactDetailFormGroup(contactDetail )) \r\n }\r\n\r\nconst addressesFromArray = new FormArray<ContactAddressForm>([]);\r\n\r\n for (address of companyBranchData.addresses) {\r\n  addressesFromArray .push(createContactAddressFormGroup(address )) \r\n }\r\n\r\nconst formGroup = new FormGroup<ComanyBranchDetailsForm>({\r\n  name: new FormControl(companyBranchData.name);\r\n  addresses: addressesFromArray ;\r\n  contactDetails: contactDetailsFromArray ;\r\n });\r\n}\r\n\r\ncreateContactDetailFormGroup(contactDetails: ContactDetails) {\r\n//again this is have 2 form arrays so we would need to create those again etc.\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nas you see something that simple as filling form with data which is super simple for forms with no  form arrays\r\n```\r\nconst form = new FormGroup({\r\na: new FormGroup({a1: new FormControl(), a2: new FormControl())), \r\nb: new FormGroup({b1: new FormControl(), b2: new FormControl())), \r\n})\r\n\r\nform.setValue({a: {a1: 'a1 value', a2: 'a2 value}, b: {b1: 'b1 value', b2: 'b2 value} )\r\n```\r\nbecomes the above.\r\n\r\nWhat's more with typed forms also comes in default value, which is impossible to implement for `FormArray` as I understands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposition is quite simple:\r\n\r\n// current constructor\r\n```\r\nconstructor(controls: CtrlT, validatorOrOpts?: ValidatorFn | ValidatorFn[] | AbstractControlOptions | null, asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null);\r\n```\r\n\r\n//proposed addition\r\n```\r\ntype InitiasisationStrategy = 'AlwaysCreate' | 'Reuse' | 'None' ;\r\ntype ClearStrategy = 'Leave' | 'Delete';\r\n\r\ntype FormArrayControlOptions  = AbstractControlOptions  & {\r\n initialiser?:  (data: any) => CtrlT;\r\n initiasisationStrategy?: InitiasisationStrategy;\r\n clearStrategy?: ClearStrategy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor(controls: CtrlT, validatorOrOpts?: ValidatorFn | ValidatorFn[] | FormArrayControlOptions  | null, asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to patch this form array we need to with this data:\r\n```\r\nconst dataFromServer: PhoneNumber [] = [\r\n  {type: 'Mobile', phoneNumber: '123456789'}, \r\n  {type: 'Work', phoneNumber: '123456780'}\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst formArray = new FormArray<PhoneNumbers>(dataFromServer, {\r\n  initiasisationStrategy: 'AlwaysCreate',\r\n  initialiser: (data:  PhoneNumber) => new FormGroup<PhoneNumber>(data), ​\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Now we can also later update it with ease\r\n\r\nformArray.setValue([[\r\n  {type: 'Mobile', phoneNumber: '123456789'}, \r\n  {type: 'Work', phoneNumber: '123456782'},  //modyfing \r\n  {type: 'Work', phoneNumber: '123456780'}, // adding\r\n]]);\r\n```\r\nAgain this would make bigger change in the second more complicated example.\r\n\r\nAs for what `InitiasisationStrategy` stands for would be:\r\n`AlwaysCreate` - always create new form groups//controls using initialiser\r\n`Reuse` - if present at the given index the reuse the control using setValue/patchValue accordingly\r\n`None` or `undefined` - current implementation\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar `ClearStrategy`\r\n`Leave`  or `undefined`- Leaves group/control if new value does not contains  value for given index //present implementation \r\n'Delete` - Delete all controls at unused indexes // only applied to on setValue\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThere is no real alternatives other that to use what is already given.\r\n\r\nThis is a very rough and quickly written issue - if given some feedback it could be improved for sure. \r\nOf course there would be many things that would need to be checked, but this change should be possible to be implemented without many braking changes apart from interface changes;\r\n\r\n\r\n### FormTouple\r\nAs for possibly incoming Form Touple I don't see use for this implementation as `FormTouple` would be used for mixing data of diffrent types and would be of fixed size anyway (and possible fixed controls ?);\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44603","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FormArray easier data controls manipulation/patch/set with initialisers\" (#44603)"},{"Id":"1092490379","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-03T13:00:08","Actor":"m-andresen","Number":"44602","RawContent":null,"Title":"Single-Input-Form Safari","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nDon't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGiven a HTML-Form with one single input element which has the required attribute and a button.\r\n\r\n**Scenario:** Focus the input element and hit the enter key\r\n\r\n**In vanilla HTML:** This results in a message and the html form wont be submitted.\r\n**In Angular:** No message is being displayed and the html form will be submitted.\r\n\r\n**Hints:**\r\n* Safari seems to be the only affected browser.\r\n* If there are two or more input elements the form wont be submitted by angular, too.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-76njbm?file=src%2Findex.html\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.0.4\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Single-Input-Form Safari\" (#44602)"},{"Id":"1092208647","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-03T04:11:03","Actor":"Zuckjet","Number":"44601","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(compiler): fix typo in `getHtmlTagDefinition()` function","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

regression?\r\n\r\nIt has only come to light with the latest version of Tailwind, so unsure\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen loading in the latest version of tailwind (3.0.8) the CLI outputs a warning about the `:where` pseudo-selector not being valid.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 rules skipped due to selector errors:\r\n  abbr:where([title]) -> unmatched pseudo-class :where\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever according to caniuse.com the selector is available based on the browserslistrc file that I am using -\r\n```\r\nlast 1 Chrome version\r\nlast 1 Firefox version\r\nlast 2 Edge major versions\r\nlast 2 Safari major versions\r\nlast 2 iOS major versions\r\nFirefox ESR\r\nnot IE 11 # Angular supports IE 11 only as an opt-in. To opt-in, remove the 'not' prefix on this line.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen looking for similar reported issues I found other reported warnings from the CLI (that are not the same as this 1) that suggested that the issue be taken up with the third part package a it was their end, however Tailwind have informed me that the selector should be available based on that browserslist (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/6805) which makes me assume there is something happening with the CLI that is causing it to erroneously report that the selector does not exist\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nDefault angular project with tailwind configured on it (added as a dependency, basic config file + their imports needed ib the base scss file)\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n1 rules skipped due to selector errors:\r\n  abbr:where([title]) -> unmatched pseudo-class :where\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.2\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, material-moment-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.1\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22437","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Build outputting warning about :where pseudo-selector\" (#22437)"},{"Id":"1091202478","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-30T16:36:43","Actor":"pauldraper","Number":"22436","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make build optimizer work for all packages","State":"open","Body":"It seems that build optimizer is stingy, and only applies to certain packages: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_optimizer/src/build-optimizer/build-optimizer.ts#L22\r\n\r\nThere are multiple issues here:\r\n\r\n(1) node_modules/@angular/core etc might not be the fully resolved name of the package.

the **$localize error** appeared every time I _accidentally_ made a mistake during development with **ng serve** and did not go away until I deleted the .angular directory and restarted ng serve.\r\n\r\nI was able to [reproduce](https://gist.github.com/reifi/a7528447fb5aca26b34097d2ef03f46f#file-reproduction_description-txt) it with a newly generated app I updated to

error -> $localize error will be shown in console and can only be fixed by deleting .angular directory.\r\n\r\nUsing `ng serve  --browserTarget=my-app:build:development,locale-it` (using localize 'it') works, probably because it's not the sourceLocale.\r\n\r\n### Workaround:\r\nUsing `ng serve  --browserTarget=my-app:build:development,locale-de-at` (using localize 'de-AT') does not work, but **omitting the 'localize' option** like  `ng serve  --browserTarget=my-app:build:development` does - although probably ignoring additional configuration like baseHref in i18n.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Found differences in cache\r\nThe cached content in  **.angular/cache/babel-dev-server-i18n/** will change from (for example)\r\n<pre>... else {\\n      i18n_0 = \\\"Unter dieser Url ist noch kein websms

But the optional chaining on `a` is preserved.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the tsconfig target is set to es2020 or later, optional chaining (eg `object?.property`) on some objects is removed in the build output, resulting in js output like `object.property`, causing a runtime error when object is undefined.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this was roughly the same bug as #18204, but it's not:\r\n* It's a runtime error, not a compile error\r\n* Most normal optional chaining works (the `?.` text is in the output)\r\n* Some optional chaining, like on the `environment` object, is removed in the build output.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:johncrim/repro-ng13.git\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\nView in browser http://localhost:4200/\r\n\r\nOr debug in VS Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nRunning the repro results in an error:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n```\r\ncore.mjs:6484 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foo')\r\n    at AppComponent.ngOnInit (app.component.ts:39)\r\n    at callHook (core.mjs:2533)\r\n    at callHooks (core.mjs:2502)\r\n    at executeInitAndCheckHooks (core.mjs:2453)\r\n    at refreshView (core.mjs:9499)\r\n    at renderComponentOrTemplate (core.mjs:9598)\r\n    at tickRootContext (core.mjs:10829)\r\n    at detectChangesInRootView (core.mjs:10854)\r\n    at RootViewRef.detectChanges (core.mjs:21425)\r\n    at ApplicationRef.tick (core.mjs:26431)\r\n```\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.2\r\nNode: 16.12.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.15\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n1.

The problem happens when the generated Angular files like main.[hash].js, pollyfils.[hash].js and runtime.[hash].js are located NOT at the site root. The structure looks like following:\r\n\r\n/index.html\r\n  /mysitefolder/main.f29052602897eb02.js\r\n  /mysitefolder/styles.755cfc65dad8627d.css\r\n  /mysitefolder/polyfills.eca354b64e370005.js\r\n  /mysitefolder/runtime.54752149a889ba60.js\r\n  /mysitefolder/815.d3bd01384abd247c.js\r\n\r\nWhen application runs, it tries to load the chunk file 815.d3bd01384abd247c.js from the application root, not from it's actual location, obviously chunk load fails. There is no configuration to customize chunk base path.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate a simple Angular application, where files are located not at the server root but at the custom directory. The chunks are not loaded.

When using the component in a stacked vertical orientation such as on the examples page of matarial.io, it creates a much larger hit area for each radio button than intended.\r\n\r\nThis leads to potentially accidental form changes by clicking in what appears to be white space.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing to the `mat-checkbox` component the clickable target is only as large as the visible label.  These input types should have very similar interaction.\r\n\r\nI found the related issue [https://github.com/angular/components/issues/14894](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/14894) where I believe the 100% width was introduced, but I believe there was a disconnect between the \"selected\"-ness of an item and its focused state.  This appears to no longer be the case as simply removing the `width: 100%` prop seems to behave as intended.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nVisit the material.io example for radio buttons: [https://material.angular.io/components/radio/examples](https://material.angular.io/components/radio/examples)\r\n\r\nIn the second example (Pick your favorite season) where the radios are oriented vertically - observe how you can control the selected option from the right hand side of the container.\r\n\r\nVisit the material.io example for checkboxes: [https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/examples](https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/examples)\r\n\r\nIn the last example (Select your toppings) where the checkboxes are oriented vertically - observe how the hit area for a given option is only as large as its visible label.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA radio button click area should be no wider than its visible label.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe click area for a radio button is the full width of its containing element.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 12.2.14\r\nNode: 14.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.10\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1202.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core               12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         12.2.14\r\n@angular/cdk                       12.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                       12.2.14\r\n@angular/flex-layout               12.0.0-beta.35\r\n@angular/material                  12.2.13\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular                12.2.14\r\nrxjs                               6.6.7\r\ntypescript                         4.3.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24158","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-radio-button): Click target is well outside of the visible label\" (#24158)"},{"Id":"1092864552","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-03T22:27:29","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"24157","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-icon-button,mat-fab,mat-raised-button,mat-flat-button): Hover effect is missing","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is largely a duplicate of https://github.com/angular/components/issues/3946\r\nThe resolution in the original issue was \"matches the spec\".\r\n\r\nWell, there is no spec for icon button per say.

The difference in this observable is it returns the observable response faster than the one which doesn't work.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n onSubmitClick() {\r\n    this.statusMessage = 'Processing, please wait...';\r\n          const inputParam = new UIInputVO();\r\n          this.service.generateOutput('inputType', inputParam).subscribe(\r\n            (response: any) => {\r\n              this.statusMessage = response.resultMsg;\r\n              this.txtOutputList = response.txtOutputInfo;\r\n              this.clipBoard.copy(response.windowsPath);\r\n              if (!this.btndisabled) {\r\n                  setTimeout(() => {\r\n                      // this will make the execution after the above boolean has changed\r\n                      this.submitbtn.nativeElement.focus();\r\n                  }, 0);\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          );\r\n  }\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should copy to user clipboard\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nnot copied the string passed to copy method\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:9.1.12\r\n- CDK/Material:9.2.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome - Version 96.0.4664.110 (\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24143","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Clipboard: copy method returns false inside observable\" (#24143)"},{"Id":"1089381773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-29T11:13:35","Actor":"lukonik","Number":"24138","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): change calculatePercent method, to calculate pr…","State":"closed","Body":"…opertly when min,max,value are 0\r\n\r\nFixes #23913","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24138","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slider): change calculatePercent method, to calculate pr…\" (#24138)"},{"Id":"1090328754","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-29T07:39:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24142","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add all prebuilt themes to experimental","State":"open","Body":"Adds the same set of prebuilt themes to experimental as in the stable package.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24142","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: add all prebuilt themes to experimental\" (#24142)"},{"Id":"1089716344","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-28T08:53:53","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24140","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-experimental/mdc-dialog): remove extra outline in high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"MDC have started including their own `border` in high contrast mode so our `outline` isn't necessary anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24140","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-dialog): remove extra outline in high contrast mode\" (#24140)"},{"Id":"1089511569","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-27T23:02:34","Actor":"shb98","Number":"24139","RawContent":null,"Title":"(bug) [Mat-table]: sorting indicator not visible under high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nmat-table sort indicator not visible under high contrast mode\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

But still, I thought it might need to be reported. And maybe we can use a simple way to handle the problem.\r\n\r\nIn my case I just change the `drop` function like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrop(event: CdkDragDrop<string[]>): void {\r\n  let totalLists = this.myLists.length - 1;\r\n  let previousIndex = totalLists - event.previousIndex;\r\n  let currentIndex = totalLists - event.currentIndex;\r\n  moveItemInArray(this.myLists, previousIndex, currentIndex);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess it must be a bit complex to find if an oriented list is truly right to left or left to right, but a very simple way is to use a flag for reverse calculation.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

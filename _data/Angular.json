Such reexports are mainly generated to satisfy strict dependency condition for generated files. Such condition is no longer the case for G3. At the same time, these alias reexports make it impossible to mix locally compiled targets with globally compiled targets. More precisely, a globally compiled target may not be able to consume a locally compiled target as its dependency since the former may import from the alias reexports which do not exist in the latter due to local compilation mode. So, to make global-local compilation interop possible, it is required to be able to turn off alias reexport generation.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434#issuecomment-1610298235 for more context.\r\n\r\nIf hiding the Jest configuration is a challenge for you, please consider if an alternative approach _without_ hooking into the Jest config is reasonable. Otherwise please post your use case to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434 so we can evaluate the best path forward for this feature.\r\n\r\nJest was incorrectly picking up custom configurations, even though they exist outside Jest's root directory. This commit fixes that behavior so Jest does not see user configurations and does not apply them. Ideally we would throw an error if a Jest configuration is found to be more clear that it isn't doing what developers expect. However they may use a Jest config to run other projects in the same workspace outside of Angular CLI and we don't want to prevent that. A warning seems like the best trade off of notifying users that a custom config isn't supported while also not preventing unrelated Jest usage in the same workspace.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a few issues where users were using a custom config either causing a problem or attempting to solve one. I want to be up front during the experimentation process what our current stance is for users playing around with Jest so we can collect feedback on how it impacts users earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26852","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix: ignore custom Jest configuration file and warn if one is found\" (#26852)"},{"Id":"2080144179","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-16T13:19:05","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26864","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/upload-artifact action to v4.1.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/upload-artifact](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact) | action | minor | `v4.0.0` -> `v4.1.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/upload-artifact (actions/upload-artifact)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/releases/tag/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Add migrations docs by [@&#8203;robherley](https://togithub.com/robherley) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/482](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/482)\n-   Update README.md by [@&#8203;samuelwine](https://togithub.com/samuelwine) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/492](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/492)\n-   Support artifact-url output by [@&#8203;konradpabjan](https://togithub.com/konradpabjan) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/496](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/496)\n-   Update readme to reflect new 500 artifact per job limit by [@&#8203;robherley](https://togithub.com/robherley) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/497](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/497)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;samuelwine](https://togithub.com/samuelwine) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/492](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/492)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v4...v4.1.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I did not expect.\r\n\r\nI have a package in node_module that exports an enum like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n(function (MyEnum) {\r\n    MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"c\";\r\n})(MyEnum || (exports.MyEnum = MyEnum = {}));\r\n```\r\nI use it in my code like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {MyEnum} from '@my-package';\r\n\r\nconst MyEnumTitlesMap = new Map<MyEnum, string>([\r\n  [MyEnum.A, 'title for A'],\r\n  [MyEnum.B, 'title for B'],\r\n  [MyEnum.C, 'title for C'],\r\n]);\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n  ...\r\n  myMethod() {\r\n    const title = MyEnumTitlesMap.get(MyEnum.A)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTypescript recognizes the enum `MyEnum` but at runtime `MyEnum` is undefined. \r\n\r\nWhen I look a the generated bundle using @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser  as builder,  with `buildOptimized: true` the genrated bundle has \r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyEnum = /*#__PURE__*/(() => {\r\n  MyEnum = MyEnum || {};\r\n  MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"d\";\r\n  return MyEnum;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nMyEnum is no longer exported, that's why at runtime it's undefined.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nI have spent 4 days trying to reproduce in a simple project but I couldn't.\r\nWhat I have is a commonJs package on npm registry which I install using yarn on my angular 16 project, the packag exports an enum which I can only use if It's inside the component for example a public property of the component and not in a const outside the component, in which case it gets tree shaken.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the enum, and it wouldn't be tree-shaken.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have been unable to reproduce myself.\n\n###

In other frameworks like react the user is able to configure the postcss configs and therefore is able to use tool like [postcss-rtlcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-rtlcss)\r\n\r\nTo support the argument further, we can take a look at one of the most popular [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/rtl/) and their recommendation of using rtlcss \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAs we understand angular team would like to maintain exclusive control over the postcss configuration. We would like to see a similar implementation to the solution provided for tailwind by looking for a specific config file such as `rtlcss.config` and adding it to the list of postcss plugins if it exists.\r\n\r\nA similar approach on how angular handles the [tailwind plugin

considered\r\n\r\nCurrently we were relying on custom webpack overriding libraries such as [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus), however these are broken with the new

as `../../node_modules/bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the path that looks more logical to me (`bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg`), then the CLI outputs a warning in the console:\r\n\r\n> Cannot optimize dependency: bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg, present in 'optimizeDeps.include'\r\n\r\nand instead of loading the file content, it loads the text

I also want to use WorkBox and not angular-serviceworker. This conflicts, for in order to compile my WorkBox template and inject built files into it it requires a second build step to be performed after angular has done emitting files to the output directory. I managed to get something like this working using a custom webpack configuration, but with angular 17 we are moving away from webpack and over to esbuild, and this customization is no longer available. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIn the angular.json config, a `serviceWorker` is either missing or declared as a pointer to an angular-serviceworker json config. \r\nI haven't thought this fully through yet, but something like the following config would be nice:\r\n```\r\n\"targets\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"serviceWorker\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./sw.ts\",\r\n        \"builder\": \"./path/to/buildScript.js\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe alternative is to give up HMR and `ng serve` completely, build angular first, then build and injectManifest into service worker and then run the entire project through a local http-server. This greatly reduces productivity.

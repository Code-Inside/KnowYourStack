This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\n[https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539)\n[https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800](https://togithub.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800)\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>expressjs/express (express)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.19.2`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4192--2024-03-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.19.1...4.19.2)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Improved fix for open redirect allow list bypass\n\n### [`v4.19.1`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4191--2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.19.0...4.19.1)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Allow passing non-strings to res.location with new encoding handling checks\n\n### [`v4.19.0`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4190--2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.18.3...4.19.0)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Prevent open redirect allow list bypass due to encodeurl\n-   deps: cookie@0.6.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I want to deploy an angular ssr app under a subpath of a domain, for example https://example.org/myapp. This subpath is handled by an nginx reverse proxy. So far so good.\r\n\r\nNow I'm adding baseHref to the angular.json. It gets added to the index.html, everything fine. But if I'm looking to the `server.ts` I see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the baseUrl is always empty. Because the baseUrl can only be set if the code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nserver.use('/myapp', router);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout using .use() the baseUrl MUST be empty. So I don't understand the whole purpose behind the default code? And of course it's not working with the default code, otherwise I wouldn't write.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this scenario is not possible without changing the server.ts fundamentally. And it would be nice, if this changes are described in the docs.\r\n\r\nOr if they were the default and changes to the baseHref option in the angular.json would also affect the server.ts. That I don't have to change the server.use() part manually.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17.3.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27356","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 17 SSR baseHref / baseUrl is not respected\" (#27356)"},{"Id":"2203699853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-25T10:17:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27346","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.24.9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.24.8` -> `v3.24.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.24.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

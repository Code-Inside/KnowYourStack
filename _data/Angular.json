One of the use cases is SystemJS creating\r\nprototype-less objects (modules) via `Object.create(null)`. The SystemJS creates an empty\r\nobject and copies promise properties into that object (within the `getOrCreateLoad`\r\nfunction). The zone.js then checks if the resolved value has the `then` method and invokes\r\nit with the `value` context.

This ensures my tests are not dependant on any sort of global state that could render my tests brittle and that the dependencies going into the test are what I expect them to be.\r\n\r\nThe second point is particularly painful as sometimes it can be unclear what is being provided to a component via the dependency injection framework. \r\n\r\nCurrent usage of TestBed requires us to `TestBed.configureTestingModule` which is a shared global state used between test blocks. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if TestBed offered the ability to setup/teardown against a specified target `Window`, and provided an object to interact with, allowing us to create a new injector for each test block.\r\n\r\nThis would add versatility to how Angular could be tested, Jest in Node or Karma in browser, all you would just need to do is provide the test module bootstrapper an appropriate `Window` target where a module would construct around that.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd the following methods to the `TestBed` interface\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface TestBed {\r\n  platformTestingDynamic(options: { windowRef?: any }): TestPlatformRef\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo given a simple component like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  template: `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    @Inject('titleProvider') public title: string\r\n  ) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could then write a test suite that, at the start of each test will construct the module, render the template and tear it down such that there is no global state (except the document, which I can also choose to bootstrap/teardown if I wanted).\r\n\r\nFurther I could reference a local `windowRef` or a global `Window` - so when running in a browser I would be able to use a real window, however when running in node I could use a substitution like JSDOM.\r\n \r\n```typescript\r\nimport { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing'\r\nimport JSDOM from 'jsdom'\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component'\r\n\r\nconst html = `<!DOCTYPE html><body></body>` \r\nconst { window: windowRef, document: documentRef } = new JSDOM(html);\r\n\r\nconst MOCK_TITLE = 'MOCK_TITLE'\r\n\r\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\r\n  let testPlatformRef: TestPlatformRef\r\n  let testModuleRef: TestNgModuleRef\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(async () => {\r\n    // Create outlet for application\r\n    documentRef.body.appendChild(documentRef.createElement('app-root'))\r\n\r\n    // Construct around my specified Window reference\r\n    testPlatformRef = TestBed.platformTestingDynamic({ windowRef })\r\n\r\n    // Bootstrap a test module\r\n    testModuleRef = testPlatformRef.bootstrapModule({\r\n      declarations: [AppComponent],\r\n      providers: [\r\n        { provide: 'titleProvider', useValue: MOCK_TITLE }\r\n      ]\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    // Bootstrap component and wait for stable\r\n    await testModuleRef.bootstrapComponent(AppComponent)\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  afterEach(() => {\r\n    testPlatformRef.destroy()\r\n    // This will automatically delete the `app-root` element \r\n    testModuleRef.destroy()\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  it('Should render title', () => {\r\n    expect(documentRef.querySelector('h1').innerHTML).toBe(MOCK_TITLE)\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nJust use the global state offered by TestBed like everyone else","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can we have a disposable TestBed?\" (#45359)"},{"Id":"1170564425","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-16T05:32:31","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"45357","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency @types/chrome to ^0.0.180","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [@types/chrome](https://togithub.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) | [`^0.0.179` -> `^0.0.180`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@types%2fchrome/0.0.179/0.0.180) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/@types%2fchrome/0.0.180/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/@types%2fchrome/0.0.180/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/@types%2fchrome/0.0.180/compatibility-slim/0.0.179)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/@types%2fchrome/0.0.180/confidence-slim/0.0.179)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I'm trying to convert a reusable angular component into a web component using `@angular/elements`. Everything works fine up to the point where I try to expose slots through the parent component, which have to be accessed through it. Everything works great in the angular application context, but the elements build cannot recognize the child slots as `@ContentChildren()`. I have created a small example to explain the issue I'm facing.\r\n\r\nI have a parent component looking like this:\r\n\r\nwrapper.component.html:\r\n```html\r\n<h1>Wrapper's own content</h1>\r\n\r\n<button (click)=\"changeChildText()\">Change child text</button>\r\n\r\n<ng-content select=\"app-child-standalone\"></ng-content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwrapper.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, ContentChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { ChildStandaloneComponent } from './child-standalone/child-standalone.component';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-wrapper',\r\n  templateUrl: './wrapper.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./wrapper.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class WrapperComponent {\r\n    // ContentChild evaluated properly in the angular application\r\n    // but is undefined in plain html\r\n    @ContentChild(ChildStandaloneComponent)\r\n    public child: ChildStandaloneComponent;\r\n\r\n    constructor() { }\r\n\r\n    public changeChildText() {\r\n      if (this.child) {\r\n        this.child.text = \"Parent modified text.\";\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe child component looks like this:\r\n\r\nchild-standalone.component.html:\r\n```html\r\n<p>child-standalone's own static content</p>\r\n\r\n<span>{{text}}</span>\r\n\r\n<ng-content></ng-content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nchild-standalone.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-child-standalone',\r\n  templateUrl: './child-standalone.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./child-standalone.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class ChildStandaloneComponent {\r\n    @Input()\r\n    public text = \"Default input text.\";\r\n\r\n    constructor() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI build both components as elements and use them in a plain html:\r\n```ts\r\n  ngDoBootstrap() {\r\n    const wrapper = createCustomElement(WrapperComponent, { injector: this.injector });\r\n    customElements.define(\"app-wrapper\", wrapper);\r\n\r\n    const child = createCustomElement(ChildStandaloneComponent, { injector: this.injector });\r\n    customElements.define(\"app-child-standalone\", child);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n    <app-wrapper>\r\n        <app-child-standalone id=\"childComp\">\r\n            <button onclick=\"changeText()\">Change from child</button>\r\n        </app-child-standalone>\r\n    </app-wrapper>\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n        let changeText = () => {\r\n            childComp.text = 'Changed directly from child through ng-content.';\r\n        }\r\n    </script>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line with the ContentChild is the one that isn't working in the `app-wrapper` element and I cannot get the parent component to manipulate the child component because the ContentChild is `undefined`. How can I make my components evaluate user-provided child slot content in elements as well?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.2.5\r\nNode: 16.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1302.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.2.5\r\n@schematics/angular             13.2.5\r\nng-packagr                      13.2.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI was actually able to work this around and make it work in both angular and web component scenarios, but the workaround seems like a hack to me.

See source code of `TaskTrackingZoneSpec`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d1ea1f4c7f3358b730b0d94e65b00bc28cae279c/packages/zone.js/lib/zone-spec/task-tracking.ts#L66\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix

the only common variable I noticed across tested websites.\r\n\r\nTo recreate the issue please follow these steps:\r\n- Have your Chrome browser updated to 99\r\n- Access Angular powered application e.g https://transparencyreport.google.com/\r\n- In Dev Tools find any element containing text e.g h1, span etc.\r\n- Apply overflow: auto/hidden on the parent element\r\n- Highlight the text element with your cursor, open contextual menu and select Print\r\n- The preview window will open and the highlighted text will not be included. \r\n\r\nNote 1: I noticed that in some cases it doesn't break when you apply the property on immediate parent, keep adding the property on next parent and eventually it will break.\r\n\r\nNote 2: that the text node needs to be highlighted, selecting print without highlight will work(entire page will be included)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error

[`v0.14.27`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01427)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.26...v0.14.27)\n\n-   Avoid generating an enumerable `default` import for CommonJS files in Babel mode ([#&#8203;2097](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2097))\n\n    Importing a CommonJS module into an ES module can be done in two different ways. In node mode the `default` import is always set to `module.exports`, while in Babel mode the `default` import passes through to `module.exports.default` instead. Node mode is triggered when the importing file ends in `.mjs`, has `type: \"module\"` in its `package.json` file, or the imported module does not have a `__esModule` marker.\n\n    Previously esbuild always created the forwarding `default` import in Babel mode, even if `module.exports` had no property called `default`. This was problematic because the getter named `default` still showed up as a property on the imported namespace object, and could potentially interfere with code that iterated over the properties of the imported namespace object. With this release the getter named `default` will now only be added in Babel mode if the `default` property exists at the time of the import.\n\n-   Fix a circular import edge case regarding ESM-to-CommonJS conversion ([#&#8203;1894](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1894), [#&#8203;2059](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2059))\n\n    This fixes a regression that was introduced in version 0.14.5 of esbuild. Ever since that version, esbuild now creates two separate export objects when you convert an ES module file into a CommonJS module: one for ES modules and one for CommonJS modules. The one for CommonJS modules is written to `module.exports` and exported from the file, and the one for ES modules is internal and can be accessed by bundling code that imports the entry point (for example, the entry point might import itself to be able to inspect its own exports).\n\n    The reason for these two separate export objects is that CommonJS modules are supposed to see a special export called `__esModule` which indicates that the module used to be an ES module, while ES modules are not supposed to see any automatically-added export named `__esModule`. This matters for real-world code both because people sometimes iterate over the properties of ES module export namespace objects and because some people write ES module code containing their own exports named `__esModule` that they expect other ES module code to be able to read.\n\n    However, this change to split exports into two separate objects broke ES module re-exports in the edge case where the imported module is involved in an import cycle. This happened because the CommonJS `module.exports` object was no longer mutated as exports were added. Instead it was being initialized at the end of the generated file after the import statements to other modules (which are converted into `require()` calls). This release changes `module.exports` initialization to happen earlier in the file and then double-writes further exports to both the ES module and CommonJS module export objects.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;indutny](https://togithub.com/indutny).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.4`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1304-httpswwwgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1303v1304-2022-03-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.0.3...v13.0.4)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser</summary>\n\n### [`v5.12.1`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5121)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.12.0...v5.12.1)\n\n-   Fixed an issue with function definitions inside blocks ([#&#8203;1155](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/issues/1155))\n-   Fixed parens of `new` in some situations (closes [#&#8203;1159](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/issues/1159))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

In my replication, you'll see that the CSS is styled to fill the vertical viewport with the \"page component\". Within the page, there is a fixed-height table that has enough rows to necessitate a scroll bar.\r\n\r\nGiven the above layout, when the `span.cdk-visually-hidden` is included in a `td`, an extra scrollbar is added to the page. In my testing, I've only observed this behavior on Chrome (98.0.4758.102 ) and Edge (99.0.1150.39). Firefox (98.0.1) does not exhibit this behavior.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In a Chromium-based browser, [open this Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dbtsh3), which was forked from the Material docs\r\n2. Toggle the flag that adds/removes the `span.cdk-visually-hidden`, and an extra scrollbar will be added/removed from the app\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the CDK's `cdk-visually-hidden` CSS class does not affect the scroll structure of the page. I would also expect the behavior of the CSS utility to be the same across browsers.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn Chromium Based browsers, the `cdk-visually-hidden` CSS utility can affect scroll behavior. On Firefox, the CSS class does not affect scroll behavior, and the inconsistent behavior can be confusing. I do not have access to Safari to test the behavior there.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `~13.0.0`\r\n- CDK/Material: `~13.0.0`\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 98, Edge 99\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows and Ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24597","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk): `cdk-visually-hidden` CSS utility can affect presence/absence of parent container scrollbar on Chrome/Edge\" (#24597)"},{"Id":"1169044447","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T10:03:32","Actor":"BenRacicot","Number":"24593","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Drag and Drop): Adding items to a dropList while dragging breaks cdkDrag element layout","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdding items to the dragList element while dragging causes miscalculation in their layout.\r\n\r\nI've seen that \"[infinite scrolling isn't supported](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19003)\".

In Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) everything works fine, and the component is smart to realize that a drag operation is ongoing so no click event is thrown and therefore no toggling.\r\n\r\nWe detected this issue when we upgraded from Angular 10.2 to 13.2. I am opening the issue here assuming it is a bug in Angular but it could be as well an issue in Firefox. We do not test that often in Firefox, but our UI tests started to fail after the upgrade to Angular 13. I have downgraded my Firefox to version 80.0 and tried the example you provide with version 10 (see https://v10.material.angular.io/components/select/examples), and still the checkbox value toggles. So I am not sure this is a regression bug.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (see screencast at https://tinyurl.com/ybz2rfqj):\r\n\r\n1. Open Firefox (tested with version 98.0)\r\n2. Go to the Angular Material's \"Select with multiple selection\" example https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-multiple\r\n3. Click on the select component.\r\n4. Try to drag an option down or up.\r\n5. See how the checkbox value got toggled (checked -> unchecked and vice-versa).\r\n\r\n__NOTE:__ Try the same steps in Chrome (any recent version) and you will see that the checkbox does not toggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe checkbox must not toggle when an option is dragged.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe checkbox toggles only in Firefox when an option is dragged.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.2.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.6\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 98.0\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, Linux (not tested in MacOS)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24583","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatSelect): Select with multiple selection in Firefox toggles the checkbox when a drag operation is started\" (#24583)"},{"Id":"1167230910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-12T15:58:36","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24581","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/drag-drop): only block dragstart event on event targets","State":"closed","Body":"Currently we block the `dragstart` event on the entire drag element which doesn't account for its disabled state and for any existing handles.\r\n\r\nFixes #24533.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24581","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/drag-drop): only block dragstart event on event targets\" (#24581)"},{"Id":"1166942535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T22:32:44","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"24580","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/dialog): add support for explicit injector","State":"open","Body":"Dialog components can be loaded asynchronously through the dynamic import, and they might be declared in the module that lives in the same file.

Firefox does not yet support manifest v3 in it's latest stable release. When Firefox makes this transition, a follow up PR will update the Firefox manifest file to version 3.\r\n\r\nBecause Firefox still needs v2, we need to keep some old v2 APIs around in our background page (service worker in v3) that will execute conditionally based on if the extension was built for v2 or v3. This is determined with the `chrome.runtime.getManifest().manifest_version` API.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n> `ng_validate.ts` content script was refactored into `ng_validate.ts` and `detect-angular-for-extension-icon.ts`. Previously this script would execute code on the main page that would detect the existence of Angular and communicate it to the DevTools background page in order to update the Angular icon and popup in the toolbar.\r\n>\r\n> This code would execute on the main page through a script tag that we supply a function to like so, `script.textContent = functionAsString`. \r\n>\r\n> With v3, this method of executing code in a content script [no longer works](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/#code-execution), so we follow the [migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-remote-code) to resolve this. \r\n>\r\n> The only notable change here is that our detection code no longer executes synchronously with `ng_validate.ts`. This is not an issue as this content script was always loaded asynchronously in the first place, and we have no such feature in Angular DevTools that requires it to execute synchronously.\r\n\r\n> The `chrome.tabs.executeScript` API no longer works in v3. As [per the guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-tabs), we switch to using `chrome.scripting.executeScript`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The `chrome.browserAction` API was previously used to set the icon and popup in the browser toolbar. In v3, this API along with the `chrome.pageAction` API was merged into the `chrome.action` API. As [per the guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-browser-action-js), we make this change.\r\n\r\n>[This guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/#updating-manifest-dot-json) to migrating the manifest.json file was followed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47575","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(devtools): migrate to manifest v3\" (#47575)"},{"Id":"1389961426","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:23:36","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47574","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47574","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#47574)"},{"Id":"1389957103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:18:22","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47573","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v14.2.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"14.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47573","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v14.2.4 release\" (#47573)"},{"Id":"1389954272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:16:26","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47572","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.2.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.2.4\" with changelog.\" (#47572)"},{"Id":"1389805798","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T18:51:00","Actor":"MichaelDessureault","Number":"47571","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Content Projection] ngIf/ngSwitch on an ng-content does not destroy the projected component(s)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIf an ng-content element is within an ngIf or ngSwitch block (either directly on the ng-content element or a parent container).

While it is not imaginative as JSX, the performance benefits make it worth the while.\r\n\r\nWhat Angular Templates limit us to, is a strict dependence on the Angular Compiler. There is no escape hatch to native Javascript; I propose determining a syntax which would make this possible.\r\n\r\nConsider how Angular developers have to do double the work to access an application constant, compared to React or Vue developers:\r\n\r\n## React\r\n\r\n#### app-settings.js\r\n````jsx\r\n\r\nexport const AppName = 'Sample React App';\r\n\r\n````\r\n#### app.jsx\r\n````jsx\r\n\r\nimport { AppName } from './app-settings.js';\r\n\r\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\r\nroot.render(<h1>Hello, world, from { AppName } </h1>);\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Angular\r\n\r\n#### app-settings.ts\r\n````ts\r\n\r\nexport const AppName = 'Sample Angular App';\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### app.component.ts\r\n````ts\r\nimport { AppName } from './app-settings';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app',\r\n  template: `\r\n  <h1>Hello, world, from {{ AppName }} </h1>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  AppName = AppName\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt's that extra binding, AppName = AppName, that can get tedious. \r\n\r\nIt also forces dependency injection to be used _everywhere_ in a component. That's great for library development, but sometimes your constants are just your constants. Javascript already gives us a module system for shipping things around - can we remove that final \"import it into Angular land\" step, and just allow templates to access them directly?\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce another class of Angular Expression which would be considered a **native expression**. Initially, I propose that we disallow the use of pipes for these expressions, though I'm sure they could be worked back in.\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatability, a **native expression** would likely need to have `{{{ }}}` as its nomenclature.\r\n\r\n# Native Expressions\r\n\r\nNative Expressions inject native javascript with minimal transformations into the final Ivy view engine instruction set.\r\n\r\nNative Expressions cannot do the following: \r\n - Use the `export` keyword\r\n - Use the `class` keyword\r\n - Use `const`, `let`, `for`, `while`, or other control flow\r\n - Use `import()`\r\n\r\nNative Expressions can do the following:\r\n - Use static `import` in the first native expression of an Angular template document\r\n - Reference component via `this`\r\n - Call functions (use at your own risk)\r\n - Access ambient variables in the scope of the template.\r\n \r\n \r\n## What are some sample templates which use Native Expressions?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Raw Expression Sample\r\n\r\n#### app-settings.ts\r\n````ts\r\n\r\nexport const AppName = 'Sample Angular App';\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### app.component.ts\r\n````ts\r\nimport { AppName } from './app-settings';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app',\r\n  template: `\r\n  <h1>Hello, world, from {{{ AppName }}} </h1>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Demonstrating import from a template.html file\r\n````html\r\n{{{\r\nimport { AppName } from './app.constants';\r\n}}}\r\n<h1>Hello world from {{AppName}}!</h1>\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Using native expressions as inputs\r\n````ts\r\n\r\nimport { AppName } from './app-settings';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n<textarea placeholder=\"Say Something about {{{ AppName }}}\"></textarea>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class SampleComponent {}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Using native expressions as inputs - square bracket syntax\r\n````html\r\n{{{\r\nimport { defaultConnectedPositions } from './app-constants';\r\n}}}\r\n<textarea [placeholder]=\"{{{ AppName }}}\"></textarea>\r\n````\r\n\r\n````\r\n#### Using getter functions - no integration with Change Detection!\r\n````html\r\n{{{\r\nimport { getAppName } from './app-constants';\r\n}}}\r\n<h1>Hi from {{{ getAppName() }}}></textarea>\r\n````\r\n\r\n## How do Native Expressions integrate with Ivy?\r\n\r\n### Sample Ivy output - static values.\r\n````\r\n/*\r\nAll relevant imports etc. are hoisted here.\r\n*/\r\nimport { AppName } from './app.constants';\r\n\r\nfunction (renderFlags, ctx) {\r\n  if (renderFlags & RenderFlags.Create) {\r\n     elementStart(0, 'h1',);\r\n     text(1);\r\n     elementEnd();\r\n  }\r\n  if (renderFlags & RenderFlags.Update) {\r\n    advance(1);\r\n    textInterpolate1('Hello world from ', AppName, '!');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Sample Ivy output - using function invocation\r\n````\r\n/*\r\nAll relevant imports etc. are hoisted here.\r\n*/\r\nimport { getAppName } from './app.constants';\r\n\r\nfunction (renderFlags, ctx) {\r\n  if (renderFlags & RenderFlags.Create) {\r\n     elementStart(0, 'h1',);\r\n     text(1);\r\n     elementEnd();\r\n  }\r\n  if (renderFlags & RenderFlags.Update) {\r\n    advance(1);\r\n    textInterpolate1('Hello world from ', getAppName(), '!');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can keep doing things that class-based \"Angular Way\". I don't have much of a choice - we've invested thousands of hours into the product and Angular is \"good enough\" that there's no reason to abandon it in a rewrite.\r\n\r\nThat said - we need to find ways to get Angular out of the way. Maybe something like Native Expressions, allowing raw Javascript to take center stage, would be one way to simplify things.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47570","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Native Expressions - Angular's answer to JSX.\" (#47570)"},{"Id":"1389533717","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T15:10:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"47569","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(localize): add polyfill in polyfills array instead of polyfills.ts","State":"open","Body":"With the recent changes in the Angular CLI (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23938) the polyfills option accepts module path that are resolved using Node module resolution.

In Angular expressions, we can reference \"let-scope\" variables, or member properties / components of the containing Component class. If we want to access module level imports, we must access those through careful orchestration with the Dependency Injector.\r\n\r\nThis decision forces Angular developers to be very explicit about what is accessible to their components. It promotes best practices. But in some circumstances, this aspect of the Angular Template makes it painful for developers and results in a lot of code duplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI propose that the concept of a Module Scoped \"Ambient Value\" be added to the Angular Template syntax. \"Ambient Values\" would work just like any other reference in an Angular Expression, with the only difference being the template value source.\r\n\r\nAmbient Values would need to be declared in the Providers array of an NgModule or Standalone Component, and use the existing Dependency Injection system.\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n\r\nimport { ambientValue } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n   providers: [\r\n      { \r\n        provide: ambientValue('foo'),\r\n        useValue: 'FOO'\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n})\r\nexport class SampleModule {}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe exact syntax for declaring an Ambient Value is up for debate - the important piece of course would be the name used for reference in the Angular Templates, and the value to resolve.\r\n\r\nThe value of an Ambient Value would be resolved once upon the first time rendering a Component - It would have a lifecycle identical to other providers in an Angular Module.\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n<!-- A sample component importing SampleModule -->\r\n\r\n<p>The message is {{foo}}</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- renders, The message is FOO -->\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problems this solves\r\n\r\nFor Component Libraries, there are complicated settings that must be developed. One example is the `Overlay` library from `@angular/cdk`. Charting libraries are another example, any component with a complex object or array of objects requiring configuration.\r\n\r\nTo configure components with complex settings, library authors must either provide an `InjectionToken` and allow consumers to configure behavior, or, provide factory functions and classes expecting consumers to duplicate code at the component typescript level.\r\n\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n// Two possible solutions for shared configuration of a hypothetical charting library\r\n\r\n\r\n// Using Inejction Tokens\r\n\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\nimport { appSpecificFooTheme } from 'app/shared/foo-theme';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-consumer-1',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart>\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n   providers: [{\r\n     provide: FooThemeConfigToken,\r\n     useValue: appSpecificFooTheme \r\n   }]\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsConsumer1Component {}\r\n\r\n\r\n// Using declaration of config values\r\n\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\nimport { appSpecificFooTheme } from 'app/shared/foo-theme';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-consumer-2',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart [theme]=\"fooTheme\">\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsConsumer2Component {\r\n  fooTheme = appSpecificFooTheme;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn the real world, this looks like \"connectedPositionStrategy\", or declaring a `trackBy:` function over and over again.\r\n\r\nAmbient Values would result in the following solution for this chart library:\r\n\r\n````\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-ambient-value-consumer',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart [theme]=\"appFooTheme\">\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsAmbientValueConsumerComponent {\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ramifications for state management\r\n\r\nIf this were to be introduced to Angular, it would change the game for state management. Right now, services must be directly injected into each component; Every application component that wants to get the login status of a user, a shopping cart inventory, etc. must inject `UserService`, `CartService` etc. and then access methods directly.\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n// Before Ambient Values\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'store-page',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <div>\r\n      <store-item></store-item>\r\n   </div>\r\n   <div *ngIf=\"user.loggedIn\">\r\n      Welcome back! Your cart is {{cart.status}}\r\n   </div>\r\n`\r\n})\r\nexport class StorePage {\r\n   constructor(\r\n     public user: UserService,\r\n     public cart: CartService\r\n   ) {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After Ambient Values (assuming UserService and CartService are ambiently declared as user and cart in a higher module).\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'store-page',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <div>\r\n      <store-item></store-item>\r\n   </div>\r\n   <div *ngIf=\"user.loggedIn\">\r\n      Welcome back! Your cart is {{cart.status}}\r\n   </div>\r\n`\r\n})\r\nexport class StorePage {}\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt is debatable which the best solution is for this; It's likely a terrible idea for shared component libraries, but whether or not it's a poor strategy for particular applications is less clear. \r\n\r\nI can imagine that in a large application development team with varying team-member experience, a Sr. Developer might develop an \"AcmeApplicationState\" module, providing a common vernacular for Jr. Developers to easily access business logic.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis feature may be declared either too much work, or too dangerous as it could promote bad coding practices. However, I think that on the main it would provide powerful ergonomics for developers and would be an appreciated improvement to Angular. For situations where common functions, queries, themes, and state is shared across an entire application, declaring it once in a Module versus re-declaring it in each component would save developers time, and enforce consistency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47560","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add Module / Global scoped variables to Angular Template Syntax\" (#47560)"},{"Id":"1389163044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T11:03:11","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"47566","RawContent":null,"Title":"NullInjectorError when using inject() in runInContext ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen providing a Service in a component, `inject()` triggers `NullInjectorError ` when called within `runInContext` : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\r\n  providers: [Service],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  public constructor(injector: EnvironmentInjector, service: Service) {\r\n    console.log(service); // OK\r\n    console.log(inject(Service)); //OK\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      injector.runInContext(() => {\r\n        console.log(inject(Service)); //KO\r\n      });\r\n    }, 100);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis does not happen\r\n* if the service is `providedIn:'root'`\r\n* if the service is provided in the module \r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yccqgi?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular 14.2.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47566","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NullInjectorError when using inject() in runInContext \" (#47566)"},{"Id":"1388241066","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T19:12:56","Actor":"atscott","Number":"47563","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): Delay router scroll event until navigated components hav…","State":"open","Body":"…e rendered\r\n\r\nCurrently, the scroll event is fired immediately after the `NavigationEnd`.

For example, we often debounce a user input search term and only actually invoke the search API after the user has stopped typing for, say, 500ms. This can be done with rxjs like this:\n\n```typescript\nreadonly searchTerm$ = new Subject<string>();\nreadonly searchResult$ = searchTerm$.pipe(\n  debounceTime(500),\n  switchMap(searchTerm => backend.search$(searchTerm))\n);\n```\n\n`resource` currently does not have an equivalent functionality. It would be great if we can have this feature built-in in the signal world!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a `debounceTime` property in the `ResourceOptions` interface, that when specified, debounce the input with the specified duration. E.g.:\n\n```typescript\nreadonly searchTerm = signal(\"\");\nreadonly searchResultResource = resource<SearchResult, string>({\n  request: () => this.searchTerm(),\n  loader: ({request}) => backend.search(request),\n  debounceTime: 500    // new feature!\n})\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can always debounce with rxjs and feed the debounced request to the resource's request, but it's kind of verbose to do so.\n\nAlso there are `auditTime`, `sampleTime` and `throttleTime` in rxjs, it could be argued that these should be added too, but I think `debounceTime` is far more common and should be addressed with priority.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Debounce support for `resource`\"

I have a setup where source (which is English) language is setup with no additional slug. Meaning that `/` or `/somepage` should get an English version. While other languages, for example German, do have a language slug: `/de`, `/de/somepage`.\n\nI was able to make the new engine work with German language fully and with English - only the home page (`/`). Any other English path (e.g. `/somepage`) results in `AngularNodeAppEngine` not being able to render anything.\n\nMy setup is also different from, what would you probably call, \"default\" in that locale `codes` are with region (e.g. de-DE), but `baseHrefs` are without the region part. This will be visible in `project.json` later.\n\nI will provide an excerpt from `project.json` and full `server.ts` here. If this won't be enough to understand my issue, I can create a reproduction project, but hopefully this will be enough 🙏.\n\n`project.json`:\n```\n\"i18n\": {\n    \"sourceLocale\": {\n      \"code\": \"en-US\",\n      \"baseHref\": \"/\"\n    },\n    \"locales\": {\n      \"de-DE\": {\n        \"translation\": \"src/locale/messages.de-DE.xlf\",\n        \"baseHref\": \"/de/\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n``` \nand `localize` is set to `true` for `build` option.\n\nHere is `server.ts`. It is basically the default one, but I have added two static file middlewares instead of the default one. With the default setup Angular will look for browser files in /de/ folder instead of /de-DE/ where they were actually generated.\n\n```\nimport {\n  AngularNodeAppEngine,\n  createNodeRequestHandler,\n  isMainModule,\n  writeResponseToNodeResponse,\n} from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { dirname, join, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport 'zone.js/node';\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\n\napp.use(\n  '/de',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'de-DE'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.use(\n  '/',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'en-US'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.get('/**', (req, res, next) => {\n  angularApp\n    .handle(req)\n    .then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next(),\n    )\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n  const port = process.env['PORT'] || 3000;\n\n  app.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n  });\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n\n```\n\nWhen I run the server with an English path that is not the home page (e.g. `/somepage`), I get the default Node.js \"Cannot Get...\" response, because the \"next()\" function is being triggered in the server meaning that Angular engine did not provide a meaningful response.\n```\n.then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next() <--- next is triggered\n    )\n```\n\nI went in to the source code of `AngularAppEngine` (`@angulr/ssr/fesm2022/ssr.mjs`) and I see that the empty response results from `getEntryPointExports` hitting the \n```\nif (!entryPoint) {\n    return undefined;\n}\n```\npart.\n\nI tried printing out the manifest (`this.manifest`) and this is what I get with the before mentioned `project.json` setup:\n```\n{\n  basePath: '/',\n  entryPoints: { '': [Function (anonymous)], de: [Function: de] }\n}\n```\nThe functions when stringified look like this:\n```\nAnonymous function: () => import('./en-US/main.server.mjs')\nNamed function 'de': () => import('./de-DE/main.server.mjs')\n```\n\nThe problem is that the `potentialLocale` parameter which comes from `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` function returns an empty string (which maps to the English bundle) only for the English home page. For other paths it returns whatever the path is. For `/somepage` it returns to \"somepage\" and then the \n```\nconst entryPoint = entryPoints[potentialLocale];\n```\nin `getEntryPointExports` obviously cannot find any matching entryPoint.\n `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` returns empty string `''` only for the home page (`/`).\nIf I change the code to default to the empty string entry point `''` the server works flawlessly, everything gets served as expected.\nThe German version works flawlessly by default because `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` is always able to extract `/de/` from the beginning of the url.\n\nSo my question is - is there something wrong with my setup? I cannot change the setup of having English url with no slug, because we would need to migrate all our english urls in a big project - it's just not doable. How can I accommodate my use case with `AngularAppEngine`? Is this perhaps a bug and could be fixed on your side?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cdk                    19.0.4\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nng-packagr                      19.0.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29350","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 19 AngularAppEngine getEntryPointExports does not handle source locale paths well\" (#29350)"},{"Id":"2785018630","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-14T15:38:00","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29340","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): move Angular compilation creation to build execution","State":"closed","Body":"The creation of the internal Angular compilation used by the internal esbuild plugin is now created within the main execution phase of the build process.

It isn't listed in the `--help`, either. However, running `ng --version` shows I'm on `19.0.6`. I'm fairly convinced it must be a version mismatch somehow, but even installing `@angular/cli` globally from scratch does not solve the issue.

The column rendering array has two properties: fieldName (which is the actual field from the backend API response) and displayName (the name that shows up in the UI). Here's a quick example:\n\n`<th mat-header-cell cdkDrag *matHeaderCellDef>{{column.displayName}}</th><td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\">{{element[column.fieldName]}}</td>`\n\nSo, when I'm setting up the row, I've got this simple string array that just has the field names from the array above. This way, the actual data can connect with the table columns. Here's a quick example:\n\n`<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedColumnsFields\"></tr><tr mat-row *matRowDef=\"let element; columns:displayedColumnsField;\"></tr>`\n\nSo after this code change, the material column reordering isn't working anymore.

For example, if there are three tabs and the user selects tab 2, the animation does not trigger or behaves unexpectedly. To reproduce the issue, you can test it in the Angular Material documentation under the \"Tabs and Navigation\" section, using the provided examples. This will help observe the incorrect behavior and compare it to the intended functionality.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Open the Angular Material Documentation.\n2. Scroll to the \"Tabs and Navigation\" section.\n3. Use the example provided in this section to test the functionality directly.\n4. Interact with the tabs in the example, particularly selecting the second tab, and observe the tab selection animation.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen selecting a tab in the Angular Material Tabs component (as in previous versions like v18.2.14):\n\nThe tab selection animation should work seamlessly and smoothly.\nThe tab indicator should transition correctly and highlight the active tab.\nThe content of the selected tab should change instantly without any issues or delays.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe tab selection animation is not functioning as expected:\n\n1. When selecting a tab, the indicator does not transition smoothly to the selected tab.\n2. The tab animation either fails to trigger or is not as smooth as in previous versions (e.g., v18.2.14).\n3. The active tab is visually unresponsive or lacks the expected animation, leading to a poor user experience.\n4. The content does not change or update with the same visual fluidity seen in older versions.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: v19\n- CDK/Material: v19 latest\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System: Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30309","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Tabs and navigation): The selected tab animation does not work properly.\" (#30309)"},{"Id":"2781770175","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-11T11:20:45","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30308","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/expansion): Focus remains on the header when clicked on the next or cancel button inside the panel","State":"open","Body":"When we click on next or cancel button the focus remained on the current panel header.

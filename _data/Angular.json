This logic has been factored out\r\ninto an `EntryPointCollector` class. Both the `ProgramBasedEntryPointFinder`\r\nand `DirectoryWalkerEntryPointFinder` now use the `EntryPointManifest` and\r\nthe `EntryPointCollector`.\r\n\r\nThe result of this change is that there is a small cost on the first run of\r\nngcc to compute and store the manifest - the processing takes 102% of the\r\nprocessing time before this PR.

I have to use a `BaseComponent` class, so all my components need to extend this class. Then, in the `BaseComponent` I have a getter, called `view`, like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class BaseComponent {\r\n  public get view(): any {\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\\@Component(\r\n...\r\ntemplate: `<div>{{view._name}}</div>\r\n...\r\n) export class MyComponent extends BaseComponent {\r\n  private _name = 'X';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is not very optimal. \r\n\r\nDid I miss something?

Run npm i\r\n2. Run ng serve\r\n3. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/assets/icons/trafficlight.png\r\n\r\n4. You'll see the image served\r\n5. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/assets/icons/nonexistentfile.png\r\n\r\n6. Instead of a 404 you get routed to the home screen\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI 6.1.5\r\n\r\nCan also reproduce in Angular CLI: 9.1.9 and subsequent latest packages\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nRunning \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\", in angular.json\r\n\r\nI don't know if the intention of the team is to have people run a custom dev-server instead?\r\n\r\nI couldn't find anything in the 200 headers returned for a missing asset file to indicate an error or anything it just looks like a normal 200\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1916426/85363814-2d075100-b565-11ea-9dfd-9a8565878281.png)\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the fact the dev server a non-existent jpg file as html and returns a 200\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17989","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve returns 200 for non-existent files in the assets folder instead of 404 - user gets redirected to the default route\" (#17989)"},{"Id":"643325219","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T19:59:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"17988","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use copy-on-write asset processing for all builds","State":"open","Body":"Optimized asset processing was only being performed when differential loading was enabled.

But I've been following the guide on angular.io and some additional blog walkthroughs.  I'm wanting to package ng-add and ng-update schematics into a component library, that I already have setup and running well.  After setting up the initial plumbing for the ng-add one, I wrote a simple unit test just to validate the setup and as soon as it hits the call to new SchematicTestRunner, it blows up with a ton of Module not found errors, including child_process and fs.  In fact i commented out everything in the unit test except the creation of the test runner, just to identify the breaking point.  And the schematic itself isn't doing anything yet except returning the tree as-is.  Interestingly, the \"blank\" schematics project doesn't use ng test at all, but instead uses jasmine directly.  But with this being in an existing Angular Library with full test suite, i wanted to test in the same way.  Any help with this, would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNot sure.

The big trouble for anyone trying to use Angular and GraphQL is that there is no way of pre-compile GraphQL documents. This way we end up with an extremely oversized bundles and increased script initialization.\r\n\r\nThere are solutions out there that compile GraphQL document into an AST:\r\n- [`graphql-tag/loader`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#webpack-loading-and-preprocessing)\r\n- [`babel-plugin-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`ts-transform-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/firede/ts-transform-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`rollup-plugin-graphql`](https://github.com/Kocal/rollup-plugin-graphql)\r\n\r\nNone of the solutions listed above can be used effectively if we intend to develop library containing GraphQL.\r\nWith application alone we could theoretically make it work with `graphql-tag/loader`. Adding library into the mix will simply not work, as `ng-packagr` is completely closed to any custom Rollup loaders.\r\n\r\nSimilar `ng-packagr` issue: https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1619\r\n\r\nDisclamer: I know the main issue is in `ng-packagr`, but I wanted to see what is the overall Angular CLI take on this, since Angular CLI is \"blocked\" by it indirectly.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIf the GraphQL is big enough in Angular it could become first class citizen.\r\nIf not (probably not), we would need some convenient way of adding loaders for both applications **and** libraries, as covering applications alone is only half of the story.\r\n\r\nI know `ng-packagr` is a complete separate project, but that is exactly the problem here. While Angular CLI is getting more open with public APIs, `ng-packagr` is as closed as ever.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe only alternative I can think of is a fork of `ng-packagr` and a custom Angular CLI packagr builder to handle this not so special case. Either that or a complete abandonment of Angular CLI.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17963","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"GraphQL support\" (#17963)"},{"Id":"641659131","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-19T07:35:05","Actor":"SethiPandi","Number":"17965","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make ng-serve Also Serve 3rdpartylicenses.txt","State":"closed","Body":"# üöÄ Feature request\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently `ng build` can generate the `3rdpartylicenses.txt`, which is great, but `ng serve` isn't able to serve the `3rdpartylicenses.txt`.

These are optional parts of a chip and\r\nshouldn't be retained always. The retention of these classes wasn't noticeable\r\nin View Engine as no factories were generated for directives.

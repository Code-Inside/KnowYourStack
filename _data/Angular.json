Each call will do the full manifest fetch, and will attempt to install a new version if applicable, downloading all the assets multiple times. The assets themselves should mostly be cached by the browser, so there aren't excessive actual requests, but it does potentially slow down the SW thread with what should be completely unnecessary processing.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8922125/228405071-96f5f7ee-35e4-4c37-98b8-9478e4467c1c.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is relevant for our application, as we run a regular background upgrade check on a timer. If a user has many tabs open, we can end up calling `checkForUpdate` multiple times. Ideally, these multiple calls do not actually trigger multiple downloads and updates.\r\n\r\nnote: the builtin `checkForUpdate` calls are all wrapped in the idle scheduler, so they do not have this issue. or, they kind of do, but it doesn't matter as much because they'll run in sequence and the later calls will just fetch the manifest once and do nothing.\r\n\r\nIf this functionality isn't desired, I should be able to make a PR to fix it.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.10\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.15 \r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.10\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.10\r\n@angular/fire                   7.4.1\r\n@angular/material               14.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.2.3\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49618","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SwUpdate checkForUpdate can run multiple times simultaneously\" (#49618)"},{"Id":"1644803779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T01:34:32","Actor":"knackstedt","Number":"49616","RawContent":null,"Title":"Lazy loading components without bound Inputs and Outputs","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore, router\n\n### Description\n\nI am writing a massive Angular application, with over 40 huge discrete components. Given the fact that many are more than 1MB of payload that a client browser needs to download, I want to lazy load as much as possible (within reason of course)\r\n\r\nTo this end, I needed to make it simple to bind inputs and outputs between things that host lazy content and the lazy-content itself. I also wanted support for making the interface generic enough to work without having to monkey-patch any of the angular core.\r\n\r\nHere is my proposed example lazy-loader that is thusofar stable, though I'm sure there are a number of bugs and limitations that I haven't encountered yet.\r\n\r\nGiven I have a decently stable and working implementation, I wanted to share it with the community.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSource of my loader: https://github.com/knackstedt/ngx-lazy-loader\r\n\r\nSample StackBlitz. \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-vr4vv7?file=src/app/example-component.html\r\nNOTE: I had to work around an issue with the dynamic import returning an invalid bundle, but it works as described in multiple test applications. This is _only_ an issue in Stackblitz it seems.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI originally used a directive ontop of `<ng-template>` but this approach had multiple issues. I also considered trying to create some injection tokens, but the proposed approach is far simpler in terms of ease-of-use in my opinion.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49616","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Lazy loading components without bound Inputs and Outputs\" (#49616)"},{"Id":"1644887314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T01:24:41","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49617","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): output hydration stats into a console in dev mode","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds a logic to output basic hydration stats into a console.

It accepts an array of data, configuration, and various business inputs. One of these inputs is a `trackBy` function, which is required since we have different data interfaces. However, there are cases when the default `trackBy` logic suffices and no function is needed. As a result, the `trackBy` input can either be a `TrackByFunction` or `null/undefined`. This presents a problem, as passing a `null/undefined` to `trackBy` in `ngFor` will result in an error.\r\n\r\nHere is the reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/optional-track-by\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt appears that Angular already handles cases where `trackBy` is not valid and null is considered a valid value, as seen in this [code snippet](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_for_of.ts#L169).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22116465/227736157-4d0e7889-d932-4d17-9ce5-906fd0469c9e.png)\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Angular assumes that `TrackByFunction` can be undefined and uses the default implementation when needed, as seen in this [code snippet](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/change_detection/differs/default_iterable_differ.ts#L55).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22116465/227735588-b4178cff-0abc-40f7-b511-f7e76a2855ce.png)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the proposed solution is to extend `TrackByFunction` to accept `null/undefined` values.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThere are two potential solutions: assigning a default value for the input or handling the case of null/undefined in the template.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49593","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow TrackByFunction be null/undefined\" (#49593)"},{"Id":"1640448934","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-25T09:29:02","Actor":"DavidANeil","Number":"49591","RawContent":null,"Title":"Zone.js does not properly handle AbortSignal in addEventListener","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nzone.js\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nZone.js tries to be clever and creates a single handler for all listeners to the same event on the same target that have the same `capture` setting.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the somewhat recent addition of the `signal` setting, this means that handlers can improperly registered, consider the following two tests:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst controller = new AbortController();\r\nwindow.addEventListener('myEvent', () => console.log('expected'));\r\nwindow.addEventListener('myEvent', () => console.log('unexpected'), {signal: controller.signal});\r\ncontroller.abort();\r\nwindow.dispatchEvent(new Event('myEvent'));\r\n// LOG: 'expected'\r\n// LOG: 'unexpected'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst controller = new AbortController();\r\nwindow.addEventListener('myEvent', () => console.log('unexpected'), {signal: controller.signal});\r\nwindow.addEventListener('myEvent', () => console.log('expected'));\r\ncontroller.abort();\r\nwindow.dispatchEvent(new Event('myEvent'));\r\n// nothing logs\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf zone.js is not installed, only `'expected'` is logged in each case.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49591","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Zone.js does not properly handle AbortSignal in addEventListener\" (#49591)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1644048626","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T00:52:17","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24921","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add an E2E to tests standalone server build","State":"closed","Body":" Add an E2E to test the generated universal application.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24921","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: add an E2E to tests standalone server build\" (#24921)"},{"Id":"1643215219","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T14:46:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24919","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.2.9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.2.8` -> `v2.2.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.8...v2.2.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.8...v2.2.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Even in a completely fresh angular project (as generated by `ng new polyfill-test`) and the canonical browserslist (as generated by `ng generate config browserslist`), the generated main.js file contains `??` operators. The default browserslist allows for Firefox 60 (as confirmed by `npx browserslist`), which does not support `??` (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing).\r\n\r\nUsing newer functions (like `Object.fromEntries`) does also not generate the corresponding polyfills.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding (https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-browser-compatibility) transpiling down and generating polyfills should work out of the box. This issue has also been independently noticed on Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75750874/angular-cli-15-and-browserslist-are-targeting-the-incorrect-ecmascript-version).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.4\r\nNode: 16.18.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24896","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Browserslist is seemingly ignored for polyfills/transpiling\" (#24896)"},{"Id":"1636368577","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T21:42:36","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"24894","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.0.0-next.5\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24894","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.0.0-next.5\" with changelog.\" (#24894)"},{"Id":"1635066233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T18:24:41","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24892","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency ini to v4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [ini](https://togithub.com/npm/ini) | dependencies | major | [`3.0.1` -> `4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/ini/3.0.1/4.0.0) |\n| [ini](https://togithub.com/npm/ini) | devDependencies | major | [`3.0.1` -> `4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/ini/3.0.1/4.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/ini</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;400-httpsgithubcomnpminicomparev301v400-2023-03-08)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/compare/v3.0.1...v4.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   `ini` is now compatible with the following semver range for node: `^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`6b70a48`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/6b70a480a47cac47b2da4ec40aba6b9b4bb77608) [#&#8203;176](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/176) postinstall for dependabot template-oss PR ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

`const` modifier in object type declarations ([#&#8203;3021](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3021))\n\n    The new TypeScript 5.0 `const` modifier was added to esbuild in version 0.17.5, and works with classes, functions, and arrow expressions. However, support for it wasn't added to object type declarations (e.g. interfaces) due to an oversight. This release adds support for these cases, so the following TypeScript 5.0 code can now be built with esbuild:\n\n    ```ts\n    interface Foo { <const T>(): T }\n    type Bar = { new <const T>(): T }\n    ```\n\n-   Implement preliminary lowering for CSS nesting ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Chrome has [implemented the new CSS nesting specification](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/) in version 112, which is currently in beta but will become stable very soon. So CSS nesting is now a part of the web platform!\n\n    This release of esbuild can now transform nested CSS syntax into non-nested CSS syntax for older browsers. The transformation relies on the `:is()` pseudo-class in many cases, so the transformation is only guaranteed to work when targeting browsers that support `:is()` (e.g. Chrome 88+). You'll need to set esbuild's [`target`](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target) to the browsers you intend to support to tell esbuild to do this transformation. You will get a warning if you use CSS nesting syntax with a `target` which includes older browsers that don't support `:is()`.\n\n    The lowering transformation looks like this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a.btn {\n      color: #&#8203;333;\n      &:hover { color: #&#8203;444 }\n      &:active { color: #&#8203;555 }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome88) */\n    a.btn {\n      color: #&#8203;333;\n    }\n    a.btn:hover {\n      color: #&#8203;444;\n    }\n    a.btn:active {\n      color: #&#8203;555;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    More complex cases may generate the `:is()` pseudo-class:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    div, p {\n      .warning, .error {\n        padding: 20px;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome88) */\n    :is(div, p) :is(.warning, .error) {\n      padding: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In addition, esbuild now has a special warning message for nested style rules that start with an identifier. This isn't allowed in CSS because the syntax would be ambiguous with the existing declaration syntax. The new warning message looks like this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] A nested style rule cannot start with \"p\" because it looks like the start of a declaration [css-syntax-error]\n\n            <stdin>:1:7:\n              1 │ main { p { margin: auto } }\n                │        ^\n                ╵        :is(p)\n\n          To start a nested style rule with an identifier, you need to wrap the identifier in \":is(...)\" to\n          prevent the rule from being parsed as a declaration.\n\n    Keep in mind that the transformation in this release is a preliminary implementation. CSS has many features that interact in complex ways, and there may be some edge cases that don't work correctly yet.\n\n-   Minification now removes unnecessary `&` CSS nesting selectors\n\n    This release introduces the following CSS minification optimizations:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      & {\n        color: blue;\n      }\n      & :hover {\n        text-decoration: underline;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    a{font-weight:700;&{color:#&#8203;00f}& :hover{text-decoration:underline}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    a{font-weight:700;:hover{text-decoration:underline}color:#&#8203;00f}\n    ```\n\n-   Minification now removes duplicates from CSS selector lists\n\n    This release introduces the following CSS minification optimization:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    div, div { color: red }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    div,div{color:red}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    div{color:red}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.17.13`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01713)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.12...v0.17.13)\n\n-   Work around an issue with `NODE_PATH` and Go's WebAssembly internals ([#&#8203;3001](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3001))\n\n    Go's WebAssembly implementation returns `EINVAL` instead of `ENOTDIR` when using the `readdir` syscall on a file. This messes up esbuild's implementation of node's module resolution algorithm since encountering `ENOTDIR` causes esbuild to continue its search (since it's a normal condition) while other encountering other errors causes esbuild to fail with an I/O error (since it's an unexpected condition). You can encounter this issue in practice if you use node's legacy `NODE_PATH` feature to tell esbuild to resolve node modules in a custom directory that was not installed by npm. This release works around this problem by converting `EINVAL` into `ENOTDIR` for the `readdir` syscall.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with CSS `@layer` rules that have parsing errors ([#&#8203;3016](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3016))\n\n    CSS at-rules [require either a `{}` block or a semicolon at the end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-at-rule). Omitting both of these causes esbuild to treat the rule as an unknown at-rule. Previous releases of esbuild had a bug that incorrectly removed unknown at-rules without any children during minification if the at-rule token matched an at-rule that esbuild can handle. Specifically [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) can generate `@layer` rules with parsing errors, and empty `@layer` rules cannot be removed because they have side effects (`@layer` didn't exist when esbuild's CSS support was added, so esbuild wasn't written to handle this). This release changes esbuild to no longer discard `@layer` rules with parsing errors when minifying (the rule `@layer c` has a parsing error):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        @&#8203;layer c\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b;\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b.c;\n    ```\n\n-   Unterminated strings in CSS are no longer an error\n\n    The CSS specification provides [rules for handling parsing errors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/syndata.html#parsing-errors). One of those rules is that user agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line (i.e., before an unescaped line feed, carriage return or form feed character), but then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string was found. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ...would be treated the same as:\n\n    ```css\n    p { color: green; color: green; }\n    ```\n\n    ...because the second declaration (from `font-family` to the semicolon after `color: red`) is invalid and is dropped.\n\n    Previously using this CSS with esbuild failed to build due to a syntax error, even though the code can be interpreted by a browser. With this release, the code now produces a warning instead of an error, and esbuild prints the invalid CSS such that it stays invalid in the output:\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new non-minified output: */\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new minified output: */\n    p{font-family:'Courier New Times\n    color: red;color:green}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.37.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.37.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.36.0...v8.37.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`b6ab8b2`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/b6ab8b2a2ca8807baca121407f5bfb0a0a839427) feat: `require-unicode-regexp` add suggestions ([#&#8203;17007](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17007)) (Josh Goldberg)\n-   [`10022b1`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/10022b1f4bda1ad89193512ecf18c2ee61db8202) feat: Copy getScope() to SourceCode ([#&#8203;17004](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17004)) (Nicholas C.

The mat-label works normally after he is focused.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: Angular 15.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Brave, Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26833","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-form-field): mat-label incorrectly displayed at init (behavior possible)\" (#26833)"},{"Id":"1638075437","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T21:14:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26828","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v15.2.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"15.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26828","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v15.2.4 release\" (#26828)"},{"Id":"1638169109","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T19:33:44","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26832","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.0.0-next.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26832","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.0.0-next.3\" with changelog.\" (#26832)"},{"Id":"1638106884","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T18:47:19","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26831","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v15.2.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26831","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v15.2.4\" with changelog.\" (#26831)"},{"Id":"1638080964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T18:41:40","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26829","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"refactor(material/progress-bar): change mat-progress-bar to u…","State":"closed","Body":"…se MDC's token API (#26643)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 04deba8c966cb127168218f3f91d986e04a8b6c1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26829","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"refactor(material/progress-bar): change mat-progress-bar to u…\" (#26829)"},{"Id":"1638085600","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T18:32:13","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26830","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"release: cut the v15.2.4 release\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 28b9b9648b16b294b8a57a7130ef2a2d65884c22.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26830","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"release: cut the v15.2.4 release\"\" (#26830)"},{"Id":"1638067978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T18:22:12","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26827","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v15.2.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26827","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v15.2.4\" with changelog.\" (#26827)"},{"Id":"1637867876","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T17:40:23","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26826","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: ran 'browserlist --update-db' to fix integration tests","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26826","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: ran 'browserlist --update-db' to fix integration tests\" (#26826)"},{"Id":"1637346561","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T11:28:59","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"26824","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/button): change to use MDC's token API","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26824","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/button): change to use MDC's token API\" (#26824)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-03-29T03:30:03.2959071Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2293}

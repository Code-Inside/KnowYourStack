However, on subsequent navigations to the module, the route change is performed synchronously, so from my knowledge you can’t immediately update the UI – you must wait until the navigation completes which can be slow.\r\n \r\nThis often means Angular apps can feel slow or unresponsive when navigating to complex components or modules, and it also leads to poor Interaction to Next Paint (INP) scores, which is an incoming Core Web Vital metric and will become a Google ranking factor.\r\n \r\nHere is a minimal repo demonstrating the issue with a 2s timer in place of a complex component. You can use the Chrome Web Vitals extension to view the INP scores drop after the modules are lazy loaded (as the loading bar doesn’t display).\r\n \r\n[https://github.com/matthew-whitfield-uk/module-routing-inp](https://github.com/matthew-whitfield-uk/module-routing-inp)\r\n \r\n \r\n**What is INP?** \r\n \r\nInteraction to Next Paint (INP) is a Core Web Vital metric that will be introduced in March 2024. It measures a page’s responsiveness to user interactions and is usually the latency of the longest click, tap, or keyboard interaction. \r\n \r\nA Chrome developer’s blog highlighted Angular as the worst-performing framework, with only 19% of Angular apps passing the maximum 200ms INP score on mobile devices:\r\n \r\n[https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inp-in-frameworks/\r\n](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inp-in-frameworks/\r\n) \r\nEven fairly lightweight Angular projects such as Angular.io are currently failing INP on mobile:\r\n \r\n[https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-angular-io/1mdibpcdkh?form_factor=mobile ](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-angular-io/1mdibpcdkh?form_factor=mobile )\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSome SPAs present a loading bar on all route navigations (e.g. YouTube desktop / Github) to give immediate user feedback that the navigation has started.\r\n \r\nAngular could add an option for similar functionality by breaking up the route change process into - Navigation Start,  Update UI with spinner, and then load new component code. This already happens when navigating to a lazy loaded module for the first time (presumably because the HTTP request for the module js is performed asynchronously which allows for a UI update) but subsequent navigations are performed synchronously.  \r\n\r\nSubsequent navigations could be moved into a setTimeout to allow the UI to update and give some immediate user feedback.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing custom route animations doesn't seem to fix this issue, and neither does adding progress bars within modules/components.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51131","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Angular Navigation UI Responsiveness and INP Scores by Breaking Up Route Changes\" (#51131)"},{"Id":"1815525350","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-21T10:05:50","Actor":"ice-blaze","Number":"51130","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template unit test coverage","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIt would be nice to see the coverage also for the templates (`.html`).

I would be nice that the coverage could see that an `*ngIf` has been triggered in at least one test.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCurrently, I'm using Jest and it uses Istanbul. I'm not sure if the problem lies in Angular, Jest, or Istanbul.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI haven't tried anything yet. I wanted to see if the community has some input to give.

https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v1.32.1...v1.33.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.18.16`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01816)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.15...v0.18.16)\n\n-   Fix a regression with whitespace inside `:is()` ([#&#8203;3265](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3265))\n\n    The change to parse the contents of `:is()` in version 0.18.14 introduced a regression that incorrectly flagged the contents as a syntax error if the contents started with a whitespace token (for example `div:is( .foo ) {}`). This regression has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.18.15`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01815)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.14...v0.18.15)\n\n-   Add the `--serve-fallback=` option ([#&#8203;2904](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2904))\n\n    The web server built into esbuild serves the latest in-memory results of the configured build. If the requested path doesn't match any in-memory build result, esbuild also provides the `--servedir=` option to tell esbuild to serve the requested path from that directory instead. And if the requested path doesn't match either of those things, esbuild will either automatically generate a directory listing (for directories) or return a 404 error.\n\n    Starting with this release, that last step can now be replaced with telling esbuild to serve a specific HTML file using the `--serve-fallback=` option. This can be used to provide a \"not found\" page for missing URLs. It can also be used to implement a [single-page app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that mutates the current URL and therefore requires the single app entry point to be served when the page is loaded regardless of whatever the current URL is.\n\n-   Use the `tsconfig` field in `package.json` during `extends` resolution ([#&#8203;3247](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3247))\n\n    This release adds a feature from [TypeScript 3.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages) where if a `tsconfig.json` file specifies a package name in the `extends` field and that package's `package.json` file has a `tsconfig` field, the contents of that field are used in the search for the base `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n-   Implement CSS nesting without `:is()` when possible ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Previously esbuild would always produce a warning when transforming nested CSS for a browser that doesn't support the `:is()` pseudo-class. This was because the nesting transform needs to generate an `:is()` in some complex cases which means the transformed CSS would then not work in that browser. However, the CSS nesting transform can often be done without generating an `:is()`. So with this release, esbuild will no longer warn when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()` in the cases where an `:is()` isn't needed to represent the nested CSS.\n\n    In addition, esbuild's nested CSS transform has been updated to avoid generating an `:is()` in cases where an `:is()` is preferable but there's a longer alternative that is also equivalent. This update means esbuild can now generate a combinatorial explosion of CSS for complex CSS nesting syntax when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()`. This combinatorial explosion is necessary to accurately represent the original semantics. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .first,\n    .second,\n    .third {\n      & > & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    :is(.first, .second, .third) > :is(.first, .second, .third) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .first > .first,\n    .first > .second,\n    .first > .third,\n    .second > .first,\n    .second > .second,\n    .second > .third,\n    .third > .first,\n    .third > .second,\n    .third > .third {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This change means you can now use CSS nesting with esbuild when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`. You'll now only get a warning from esbuild if you use complex CSS nesting syntax that esbuild can't represent in that older browser without using `:is()`. There are two such cases:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    a b {\n      .foo & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a {\n      > b& {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    These two cases still need to use `:is()`, both for different reasons, and cannot be used when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    .foo :is(a b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a > a:is(b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically lower `inset` in CSS for older browsers\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically expand the `inset` property to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties when esbuild's `target` is set to a browser that doesn't support `inset`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 10px;\n      right: 20px;\n      bottom: 10px;\n      left: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add support for the new [`@starting-style`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/#defining-before-change-style-the-starting-style-rule) CSS rule ([#&#8203;3249](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3249))\n\n    This at rule allow authors to start CSS transitions on first style update. That is, you can now make the transition take effect when the `display` property changes from `none` to `block`.\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;starting-style {\n      h1 {\n        background-color: transparent;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Output */\n    @&#8203;starting-style{h1{background-color:transparent}}\n    ```\n\n    This was contributed by

https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.3.0...3.3.1\n\nThis release fixes a regression for cases where the `ignore` option is used with a string ([#&#8203;403](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/403), [#&#8203;404](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/404)).\n\nThe public interface of this package does not support a string as the value for the [`ignore` option](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#ignore) since 2018 year ([release](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/2.0.0)).\n\nSo, in the next major release, we will reintroduce method implementations that do not involve strings in the `ignore` option.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n###

error.\n\n### [`v1.64.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1640)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.63.6...1.64.0)\n\n-   Comments that appear before or between `@use` and `@forward` rules are now\n    emitted in source order as much as possible, instead of always being emitted\n    after the CSS of all module dependencies.\n\n-   Fix a bug where an interpolation in a custom property name crashed if the file\n    was loaded by a `@use` nested in an `@import`.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Add a new `SassCalculation` type that represents the calculation objects added\n    in Dart Sass 1.40.0.\n\n-   Add `Value.assertCalculation()`, which returns the value if it's a\n    `SassCalculation` and throws an error otherwise.\n\n-   Produce a better error message when an environment that supports some Node.js\n    APIs loads the browser entrypoint but attempts to access the filesystem.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Fix a bug where nested relative `@imports` failed to load when using the\n    deprecated functions `render` or `renderSync` and those relative imports were\n    loaded multiple times across different files.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.19.2`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5192)\n\n[Compare

But it can take a bit to clean up a misspelling higher closer to the root in deeply nested paths. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhat feels like a fairly simple solution to this would be to lightly highlight any path segments that are going to be creating a new folder. This way the user can see if the folders being created match what they expect. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nCurrently the workaround is to type very slowly and carefully check every letter on deeply nested paths or navigate around the full structure of the application and run the command at the closest point to where the files will be generated.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.13...v0.18.14)\n\n-   Implement local CSS names ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release introduces two new loaders called `global-css` and `local-css` and two new pseudo-class selectors `:local()` and `:global()`. This is a partial implementation of the popular [CSS modules](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules) approach for avoiding unintentional name collisions in CSS. I'm not calling this feature \"CSS modules\" because although some people in the community call it that, other people in the community have started using \"CSS modules\" to refer to [something completely different](https://togithub.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/60c9f682b63c622bfa0d8222ea6b1f3b659e007c/proposals/css-modules-v1-explainer.md) and now CSS modules is an overloaded term.\n\n    Here's how this new local CSS name feature works with esbuild:\n\n    -   Identifiers that look like `.className` and `#idName` are global with the `global-css` loader and local with the `local-css` loader. Global identifiers are the same across all files (the way CSS normally works) but local identifiers are different between different files. If two separate CSS files use the same local identifier `.button`, esbuild will automatically rename one of them so that they don't collide. This is analogous to how esbuild automatically renames JS local variables with the same name in separate JS files to avoid name collisions.\n\n    -   It only makes sense to use local CSS names with esbuild when you are also using esbuild's bundler to bundle JS files that import CSS files. When you do that, esbuild will generate one export for each local name in the CSS file. The JS code can import these names and use them when constructing HTML DOM. For example:\n\n        ```js\n        // app.js\n        import { outerShell } from './app.css'\n        const div = document.createElement('div')\n        div.className = outerShell\n        document.body.appendChild(div)\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* app.css */\n        .outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        When you bundle this with `esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.css=local-css --outdir=out` you'll now get this (notice how the local CSS name `outerShell` has been renamed):\n\n        ```js\n        // out/app.js\n        (() => {\n          // app.css\n          var outerShell = \"app_outerShell\";\n\n          // app.js\n          var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n          div.className = outerShell;\n          document.body.appendChild(div);\n        })();\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* out/app.css */\n        .app_outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        This feature only makes sense to use when bundling is enabled both because your code needs to `import` the renamed local names so that it can use them, and because esbuild needs to be able to process all CSS files containing local names in a single bundling operation so that it can successfully rename conflicting local names to avoid collisions.\n\n    -   If you are in a global CSS file (with the `global-css` loader) you can create a local name using `:local()`, and if you are in a local CSS file (with the `local-css` loader) you can create a global name with `:global()`. So the choice of the `global-css` loader vs. the `local-css` loader just sets the default behavior for identifiers, but you can override it on a case-by-case basis as necessary. For example:\n\n        ```css\n        :local(.button) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        :global(.button) {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Processing this CSS file with esbuild with either the `global-css` or `local-css` loader will result in something like this:\n\n        ```css\n        .stdin_button {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        .button {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   The names that esbuild generates for local CSS names are an implementation detail and are not intended to be hard-coded anywhere. The only way you should be referencing the local CSS names in your JS or HTML is with an `import` statement in JS that is bundled with esbuild, as demonstrated above. For example, when `--minify` is enabled esbuild will use a different name generation algorithm which generates names that are as short as possible (analogous to how esbuild minifies local identifiers in JS).\n\n    -   You can easily use both global CSS files and local CSS files simultaneously if you give them different file extensions. For example, you could pass `--loader:.css=global-css` and `--loader:.module.css=local-css` to esbuild so that `.css` files still use global names by default but `.module.css` files use local names by default.\n\n    -   Keep in mind that the `css` loader is different than the `global-css` loader. The `:local` and `:global` annotations are not enabled with the `css` loader and will be passed through unchanged. This allows you to have the option of using esbuild to process CSS containing while preserving these annotations. It also means that local CSS names are disabled by default for now (since the `css` loader is currently the default for CSS files). The `:local` and `:global` syntax may be enabled by default in a future release.\n\n    Note that esbuild's implementation does not currently have feature parity with other implementations of modular CSS in similar tools. This is only a preliminary release with a partial implementation that includes some basic behavior to get the process started. Additional behavior may be added in future releases. In particular, this release does not implement:\n\n    -   The `composes` pragma\n    -   Tree shaking for unused local CSS\n    -   Local names for keyframe animations, grid lines, `@container`, `@counter-style`, etc.\n\n    Issue [#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20) (the issue for this feature) is esbuild's most-upvoted issue! While this release still leaves that issue open, it's an important first step in that direction.\n\n-   Parse `:is`, `:has`, `:not`, and `:where` in CSS\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse the contents of these pseudo-class selectors as a selector list. This means you will now get syntax warnings within these selectors for invalid selector syntax. It also means that esbuild's CSS nesting transform behaves slightly differently than before because esbuild is now operating on an AST instead of a token stream. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      :where(.foo&) {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(.foo:is(div)) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(div.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack (webpack)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.88.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.88.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fixed a bug where unused identifiers should retain names when using css modules by [@&#8203;burhanuday](https://togithub.com/burhanuday) in [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

There are over 100 components, with each multiple examples that I'd like to run live on the site.\r\nThe documentation site is not an Angular SPA, but set up via a \"markdown -> static site\" generator ([mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nExpose the internal application builder function, allowing me to build the entire documentation with multiple entry-points—each with its own bootstrap—in one go.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default createBuilder((input, context) =>\r\n\tbuildApplicationInternal( // <-- using internal import here\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\twatch: false,\r\n\t\t\tprogress: false,\r\n\r\n\t\t\tindex: false,\r\n\t\t\tentryPoints: collectEntryPoints(context),\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// more options\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcontext,\r\n\t),\r\n);\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPast solutions for our documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Make the documentation a regular angular app. That's how we started out, turns out no one likes writing documentation like this.\r\n2. Copy the aio setup from angular/angular and make our own \"markdown pages -> angular app\" pipeline. Tried that, but the setup of aio is&hellip; not the easiest to understand or maintain if you're not used to it.\r\n3. Use storybook. That's where we're currently at.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to exposing the internal application builder function:\r\n\r\n4. Build every page into a separate angular app. This makes the build prohibitively slow.\r\n5. Build a single angular app with bootstraps for every documentation page. This would either load all code for all pages for any page, or it would require quite a lot of shenanigans to ensure we don't load all that superfluous javascript over a shabby internal corporate proxy server.\r\n6. Make the multiple entry points available in the existing experimental application builder's schema. For me this solution would work equally well, but I believe the use case (running angular in an MPA) to be so different from what a regular angular app looks like that adding the option will only lead to confusion for developers who just want to build SPAs.\r\n7. Make a separate \"MPA application\" builder. This puts the onus on the angular team to properly support building Angular MPAs, which I don't expect to align with the goals of the framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose internal application builder function\" (#25556)"},{"Id":"1810397018","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T20:10:11","Actor":"HerRA17","Number":"25554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Trying to use ng command and I get this two sort of errors: npm ERR!

For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV && doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild --define:DEV=true`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --define:DEV=false`\n\n    One drawback of this approach is that the resulting code crashes if you don't provide a value for `DEV` with `--define:`. In practice this isn't that big of a problem, and there are also various ways to work around this.\n\n    However, another approach that avoids this drawback is to use JavaScript label statements instead. That's what the `--drop-labels=` flag implements. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV: doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, you can now build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --drop-labels=DEV`\n\n    This means that code containing optional development-only checks can now be written such that it's safe to run without any additional configuration. The `--drop-labels=` flag takes comma-separated list of multiple label names to drop.\n\n-   Avoid causing `unhandledRejection` during shutdown ([#&#8203;3219](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3219))\n\n    All pending esbuild JavaScript API calls are supposed to fail if esbuild's underlying child process is unexpectedly terminated. This can happen if `SIGINT` is sent to the parent `node` process with Ctrl+C, for example. Previously doing this could also cause an unhandled promise rejection when esbuild attempted to communicate this failure to its own child process that no longer exists. This release now swallows this communication failure, which should prevent this internal unhandled promise rejection. This change means that you can now use esbuild's JavaScript API with a custom `SIGINT` handler that extends the lifetime of the `node` process without esbuild's internals causing an early exit due to an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n-   Update browser compatibility table scripts\n\n    The scripts that esbuild uses to compile its internal browser compatibility table have been overhauled. Briefly:\n\n    -   Converted from JavaScript to TypeScript\n    -   Fixed some bugs that resulted in small changes to the table\n    -   Added [`caniuse-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caniuse-lite) and [`@mdn/browser-compat-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;mdn/browser-compat-data) as new data sources (replacing manually-copied information)\n\n    This change means it's now much easier to keep esbuild's internal compatibility tables up to date. You can review the table changes here if you need to debug something about this change:\n\n    -   [JS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/d259b8fac717ee347c19bd8299f2c26d7c87481a...af1d35c372f78c14f364b63e819fd69548508f55#diff-1649eb68992c79753469f02c097de309adaf7231b45cc816c50bf751af400eb4)\n    -   [CSS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/commit/95feb2e09877597cb929469ce43811bdf11f50c1#diff-4e1c4f269e02c5ea31cbd5138d66751e32cf0e240524ee8a966ac756f0e3c3cd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.45.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.45.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.44.0...v8.45.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`cdd063c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/cdd063c388bbfe1781d7a864a832f03a2c1cc277) feat: Expose LegacyESLint in unsupported API ([#&#8203;17341](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17341)) (Nicholas C.

However, some browsers (e.g. Chrome and Firefox) trigger the `focusout` event when the user switches tabs and returns, and set `event.relatedTarget` to null. This causes the `activeItemIndex` to be out of sync with the actual focused element, leading to incorrect behavior and user confusion. To fix this, we use `document.activeElement` as a fallback for `event.relatedTarget`, and update the `activeItemIndex` accordingly.\r\n\r\nFixes #27474.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27499","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/listbox): prevent wrong activeItemIndex after browser tab switch\" (#27499)"},{"Id":"1816817372","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-22T16:17:32","Actor":"sksadri","Number":"27498","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-menu): Doesn't follow document LTR/RTL directionality when changed","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\ndynamically flipping the direction of a page does not trigger a change in menu direction.

the same ID","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there seem to be no simple way to connect various drop lists in various components, unless they have a `cdkDropListGroup` on top of them, or a defined list of ids, which is not achievable in many cases.\r\n\r\nHence we could imagine that the `connectedTo` input could be used to connect several lists, depending on a single  `id` parameter (or maybe some `groupName` ?), like : \r\n\r\n```\r\n// In some place in the code\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n...\r\n// In a completely different place\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n...\r\n// In another completely different place\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the Input `connectedTo` already supports an ID as `string` but gets only a single element, as it can be seen in the code : \r\n```\r\nconst siblings = coerceArray(this.connectedTo).map(drop => {\r\n        if (typeof drop === 'string') {\r\n            const correspondingDropList = CdkDropList._dropLists.find(list => list.id === drop); <-- Here\r\n\r\n          if (!correspondingDropList && (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode)) {\r\n            console.warn(`CdkDropList could not find connected drop list with id \"${drop}\"`);\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          return correspondingDropList!;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return drop;\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence replacing `.find(list => list.id === drop)` by a `.filter(list => list.id === drop)` pipe will allow to register as siblings all the lists that have this ID, so it may not be a big deal technically (in first approximation).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI've got a dataviz interface where datasets could be drag n' dropped in various containers (columns, graphs, segments, etc), but not knowing the number of them and not being able to get them under a single group.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27493","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(CdkDropList): Allow to connect to lists sharing the

\"**_table-flex-styles.scss**\" file\r\n\r\n`mat-cell,\r\n    mat-header-cell,\r\n    mat-footer-cell {\r\n\r\n        // Note: we use `first-of-type`/`last-of-type` here in order to prevent extra\r\n

   }\r\n        }\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nfor LTR it works fine because we set only padding-left for the first-of-type and padding-right for the last-of-type, and still get the original one in

I want a specific density for only input components.\r\n\r\nI am following the documentation here: https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#customizing-density\r\n\r\n\r\n`@include mat.input-density(-2);` has no effect.\r\n\r\nDrilling into some of the code, `mat.input-density` eventually calls an empty sass mixin:\r\n\r\n**_input-theme.scss**\r\n`@mixin density($config-or-theme) {}` \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure if the empty mixin is related, but following the code, that's where I end up.\r\n\r\nWorks:\r\n```\r\n$theme: mat.define-light-theme(\r\n  (\r\n    color: (\r\n      primary: $theme-primary,\r\n      accent: $theme-accent,\r\n      warn: $theme-warn,\r\n    ),\r\n    typography: mat.define-typography-config(),\r\n    density: -2\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.\r\n// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component\r\n// that you are using.\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes not work:\r\n```\r\n$theme: mat.define-light-theme(\r\n  (\r\n    color: (\r\n      primary: $theme-primary,\r\n      accent: $theme-accent,\r\n      warn: $theme-warn,\r\n    ),\r\n    typography: mat.define-typography-config(),\r\n    density: 0\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.\r\n// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component\r\n// that you are using.\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n@include mat.input-density(-2); // <- Add custom density for inputs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/cy5fh6?file=src%2Ftheme.scss,src%2Findex.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set custom density on input component using mat.input-density as outlined in the documentation\r\n2. Observe there is no effect\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCustom density should reflect on the component it is set on.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nDensity is not set.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.1.4\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.5\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27470","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Input): @include mat.input-density(-2); has no effect\" (#27470)"},{"Id":"1810093283","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T14:48:45","Actor":"alirezamirian","Number":"27474","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(listbox): focus issue when moving back from another tab","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSwitching tabs can lead to a state where focused item is different from the item that will be toggled when pressing `Space`.

Active index is correctly 2.\r\n2. move to another tab\r\n3. move back to the stackblitz tab\r\n4. Now \"Italian\" is still shown as the focused item, and is in fact focused (document.activeElement is the \"Italian\"'s LI item),\r\n    But pressing Space will toggle the first item.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the example, it seems the issue is rooted in ListKeyManager changing the activeItemIndex to 0, when focus is lost by moving to another.

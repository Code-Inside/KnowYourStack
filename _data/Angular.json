These errors were due to an exposed Decorator signature from `@angular/core` that TypeScript thought was incompatible with standard decorators. However, Angular's class decorators (`Component`, `Directive`, `Pipe`, `Injectable`, `NgModule`) are actually already compatible with standard decorators. The export types for the decorators only needed to be updated to reflect that compatibility. With the updated exported types, applications will now successfully compile and execute in AOT mode with one important dependency injection caveat explained in the note below.\r\nFor JIT mode applications that are built with the Angular CLI, `@ngtools/webpack`, or use `tsickle`, there were also no additional changes required. These tools automatically convert property decorators (now called field decorators) at build time to store Angular property metadata directly on the relevant class. Building with these tools is the overwhelmingly common method of building an application. However, to support any applications that do not use these tools, the parameter decorators and class decorators were also updated to correctly store the Angular property metadata directly on the relevant class at runtime. For these applications with the experimental decorators, the property metadata was also set at runtime, so this provides equivalent behavior in the context of the property metadata.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Angular constructor dependency injection that requires parameter decorators is not supported. The standard decorator specification does not support parameter decorators. The `inject` function must be used for all cases that previously required a parameter decorator. This includes such decorators as `Inject`, `Optional`, `Self`, `SkipSelf`, `Host`, and `Attribute`. Constructor dependency injection that relies only on the supplied parameter type will continue to function as expected if using AOT; as well as in JIT mode if using the Angular CLI, `@ngtools/webpack` directly, or `tsickle`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the `inject` function can be found at: https://angular.io/api/core/inject\r\nThe decorator specification proposal can be found at: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators\r\n\r\nAn initial CLI E2E test that uses these changes is available here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24886","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49492","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): support usage of non-experimental decorators with TypeScript 5.0\" (#49492)"},{"Id":"1632162750","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-20T13:53:00","Actor":"Yqnn","Number":"49491","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix:(forms) fix boundary symbols insertion in pattern validator","State":"open","Body":"Validators.pattern automatically inserts boundary symbols if the provided regex doesn't already have them.\r\nBefore the current fix, the following regex : 'A|B' would be transformed into '^A|B$', which matches /^A.*$/ or /^.*B$/ instead /^A$/ or /^B$/. The fix consists in transforming 'A|B' into '^(?:A|B)$' instead. A more accurate solution would be to use RegExp.prototype.exec() instead of RegExp.prototype.test(), and then ensure indices cover the full string, but that would have a performance impact.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

components.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a feature request about _binding classes for component activated by `router-outlet`_.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd an `@Input() componentClasses: string[] | ((component: Object) => string[]) = []` to `router-outlet` directive.\r\n\r\nAafter `this.activated` is initialized, add the classes to the created or attached component as following:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nif (Array.isArray(this.componentClasses)) {\r\n  this.activated.location.nativeElement.classList.add(...this.componentClasses);\r\n} else if (this.componentClasses) {\r\n  this.activated.location.nativeElement.classList.add(...this.componentClasses(this.activated.instance));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor make the private activated property a combination of setter and

considered\r\n\r\nCurrently, as mentioned above, for each route component, the following codes should be added in the `@Component` metadata:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  host:  {\r\n    '[class.content-container]': 'true',\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding `componentClasses` to router-outlet solves it more directly and

I understand it is for performance improvement, But for already existing big enterprise-level applications, with many developers, it poses a big problem. Since many devs are working, an import-based circular dependency can be easily inserted in any part of the code, and with the useful 'circular dependency warnings' removed, there is no way to find such issues. And these issues may cause application to actually break in production. Which causes a huge impact on our reputation with the customer. We tried the alternatives suggested, but no luck\r\n\r\n1) Eslint -> import/no-cycle -> Makes our linter in CI run for more than 1.5 hours and finally breaks\r\n14:55:00  Linting \"@abcd/mnop-efgh\"...\r\n16:27:07  Cannot contact xyz-slave1: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\nThis is probably because our application is very big\r\n\r\n2) Madge -> Only found the type-based circular dependencies and no other circular dependencies... It is able to detect all circ-deps for a smaller application, But since our app is huge it is probably not able to find anything relevant.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1) Keep the showCircularDependencies flag for development and not have it in production. In the angular.json we can have a warning, if showCircularDependencies is set to true, stating, \"Do not use in Production as it will slow the build\".\r\n\r\n2) Angular can have another script, which after running can let us know the circular dependency warnings. This script can be based on the build, used in Angular-13 or before... which finds circular dependencies. This script will be different from the build so no performance impact will be there.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs mentioned above eslint and madge were tried, but no value was added.

Within that components, I have a mat-select, which is not displaying any options, as the title mentioned. When I click on it, the select field itself is focused and gets the correct classes, but the options overlay is not appearing.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that something is wrong with the handling of the overlay in combination with dynamically generated components. When checking the DOM, I could see that the overlay container was not added to the body. Outside of the dynamic component the exact same mat-select works as expected. I also tried to create a dialog within my dynamic component and it also works fine (overlay container is attached to the body).\r\n\r\nEvery other functionality within the component is working as well (root services, ngrx store, ...).\r\n\r\nThere are no console errors.\r\n\r\nModule imports contain MatSelectModule, MatInputModule & MatFormFieldModule.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I just missing something?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. add mat-select to popupComponent:\r\n```\r\n<mat-form-field appearance=\"fill\">\r\n\t<mat-select multiple [formControl]=\"statusFormControl\">\r\n\t\t<mat-option *ngFor=\"let status of statuses\" [value]=\"status\">{{ status.id }}</mat-option>\r\n\t</mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Generate Component with createComponent(), using a generic EnvironmentInjector:\r\n\r\n`const popupComponent: ComponentRef<PopupComponent> = createComponent(PopupComponent, {\r\n\tenvironmentInjector: this._environmentInjector\r\n});`\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Add data to the component and execute change detection:\r\n\r\n`component.instance.statuses = statuses;\r\ncomponent.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. bind content to map popup (might be a possible source for the bug as well):\r\n\r\n`mapMarker.bindPopup(popupComponent.location.nativeElement as Content);`\r\n\r\n\r\n5. when opening the popup on the map and clicking on the select, the highlighting is correct, but nothing else happens:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125544629/225877898-4a2c8117-ce56-41ac-9fc0-37570d2e91da.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nmat-options should show up\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-options notshowing up, overlay container not attached\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 102.8\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): mat-options not showing up on dynamically generated component\" (#26803)"},{"Id":"1628386782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-16T22:30:14","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26801","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(select, autocomplete): strong focus indicator not present for selected option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor options in a select or autocomplete, strong focus only appears on items that are *not* selected.

For example, I would like to make a chip that performs an action when clicked (e.g. increment a counter on click). I would expect this chip to be a native `<button/>` element or an element with `role=\"button\"`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions Considered\r\n\r\n#### listbox\r\n`<mat-chip-listbox/>` is not an appropriate choice because it is for the ARIA listbox interaction pattern, which is not appropriate for chips that perform an action when clicked.\r\n\r\n### grid\r\n`<mat-chip-grid>` is also no an appropriate choice because it is part of chips that are a free form input.\r\n\r\n### `<mat-chip-set> and <mat-chip>`\r\n`<mat-chip-set> and <mat-chip>` allow the developer to set the aria role. Although, they are not designed to be interactive.

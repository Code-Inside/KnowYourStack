This commit also exposes some helpers for\r\nimplementers of custom outlets to do their own input binding if desired.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18967\r\n\r\nEdit to add some more color to the \"required inputs\" / no references / no compiler warning for the inputs:\r\n\r\n- Some router data lives entirely in userspace and isn't known until runtime. This includes path parameters and query parameters. Only static `data` or `resolve` items can be known at compilation time.\r\n- We considered requiring that bindings be defined in the `data` or `resolve` of the `Route` definitions. However, this would require developers to set the [runGuardsAndResolvers](https://angular.io/api/router/RunGuardsAndResolvers) option at least to `'pathParamsOrQueryParamsChange'`. This was undesirable from a usability and discoverability standpoint.\r\n- Required inputs are checked by the template type checking. Because these components are created dynamically by the `RouterOutlet`, required inputs cannot be checked by the compiler. This is also true of any other component created dynamically.\r\n- We also considered yet another property on `Route` to define what bindings to set on the component. Similar to the point above, this was much more verbose than desired.\r\n- There might be some compiler magic we could add to do some level of type checking. However, I feel the Router package should be developed in a way that isn't \"special\". That is, it's a library that doesn't use any private APIs or integrations that aren't available to any library author. This ensures that the capabilities in the Router can always be replicated in an alternate Routing library driven by the community; I think this is an important property to at least have as a goal for the health of community projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49633","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Feature to bind `Router` information to component inputs\" (#49633)"},{"Id":"1644912445","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T17:19:02","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49619","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): clear pending navigation task in a microtask","State":"closed","Body":"This commit updates the logic in the Router that keep track of the initial navigation from being a synchronous to a microtask (Promise.resolve) to allow redirects during the initial navigation.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49619","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(router): clear pending navigation task in a microtask\" (#49619)"},{"Id":"1646142564","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T16:30:25","Actor":"LeonadoRivaldo","Number":"49632","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: Module not found: ERror package path ./....","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI creating a custom library and I'm having this issue when using it,\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5981900/228603384-dc171bfc-98f9-4596-a695-d991a74326fe.png)\r\nthis is the public API\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5981900/228603682-f6df66b8-05a9-4d01-81d0-08443c4f46df.png)\r\nPACKAGE json\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5981900/228603843-fca973ba-60f2-4f0f-9d6e-474743d9450f.png)\r\nthis is the ng-package\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5981900/228604003-0a26d244-a305-4e66-a59a-f733b59cff9e.png)\r\n\r\n i just need help figuring this out.

It turns out the `parent` dependencies of node 2, 3, and 4 are all resolved to node #1.\r\n\r\n[Stackblitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wv2uu2?devToolsHeight=33&file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe DI system should resolve the dependency from the node injector first before turning to the embedded view injector. The embedded view injector should not have a higher priority than the node injector.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wv2uu2?devToolsHeight=33&file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.1.0-next.2\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, core, forms, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.0-next.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.0-next.2\r\n@angular/compiler-cli           15.1.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49621","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Node Injector Should Be Checked Before Embedded View Injector\" (#49621)"},{"Id":"1644919959","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T02:12:38","Actor":"lara-newsom","Number":"49620","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): add lara newsom to GDE resources","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [X] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Each call will do the full manifest fetch, and will attempt to install a new version if applicable, downloading all the assets multiple times.

If a user has many tabs open, we can end up calling `checkForUpdate` multiple times. Ideally, these multiple calls do not actually trigger multiple downloads and updates.\r\n\r\nnote: the builtin `checkForUpdate` calls are all wrapped in the idle scheduler, so they do not have this issue. or, they kind of do, but it doesn't matter as much because they'll run in sequence and the later calls will just fetch the manifest once and do nothing.\r\n\r\nIf this functionality isn't desired, I should be able to make a PR to fix it.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.10\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.15 \r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.10\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.10\r\n@angular/fire                   7.4.1\r\n@angular/material               14.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.2.3\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49618","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SwUpdate checkForUpdate can run multiple times simultaneously\" (#49618)"},{"Id":"1644803779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T01:34:32","Actor":"knackstedt","Number":"49616","RawContent":null,"Title":"Lazy loading components without bound Inputs and Outputs","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore, router\n\n### Description\n\nI am writing a massive Angular application, with over 40 huge discrete components.

[`v16.0.0-next.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600-next5-2023-03-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/16.0.0-next.4...16.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### bazel\n\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n\n##### common\n\n-   If the 'ngTemplateOutletContext' is different from the context, it will result in a compile-time error.\n\nBefore the change, the following template was compiling:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MyContext {\n  $implicit: string;\n}\n\n@&#8203;Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [NgTemplateOutlet],\n  selector: 'person',\n  template: `\n    <ng-container\n      *ngTemplateOutlet=\"\n        myTemplateRef;\n        context: { $implicit: 'test', xxx: 'xxx' }\n      \"></ng-container>\n  `,\n})\nexport class PersonComponent {\n  myTemplateRef!: TemplateRef<MyContext>;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it does not compile now because the 'xxx' property does not exist in 'MyContext', resulting in the error: 'Type '{ $implicit: string; xxx: string; }' is not assignable to type 'MyContext'.'\n\nThe solution is either:\n\n-   add the 'xxx' property to 'MyContext' with the correct type or\n-   add '$any(...)' inside the template to make the error disappear. However, adding '$any(...)' does not correct the error but only preserves the previous behavior of the code.\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   `entryComponents` has been deleted from the `@NgModule` and `@Component` public APIs. Any usages can be removed since they weren't doing anyting.\n    -   `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` injection token has been deleted. Any references can be removed.\n-   ComponentRef.setInput will only set the input on the\n    component if it is different from the previous value (based on `Object.is`\n    equality). If code relies on the input always being set, it should be\n    updated to copy objects or wrap primitives in order to ensure the input\n    value differs from the previous call to `setInput`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`. Please update the imports.\n\n```diff\n- import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n+ import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/core';\n```\n\n-   The `@Directive`/`@Component` `moduleId` property is now\n    deprecated. It did not have any effect for multiple major versions and\n    will be removed in v17.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   `PlatformConfig.baseUrl` and `PlatformConfig.useAbsoluteUrl` platform-server config options  are deprecated as these were not used.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Even in a completely fresh angular project (as generated by `ng new polyfill-test`) and the canonical browserslist (as generated by `ng generate config browserslist`), the generated main.js file contains `??` operators. The default browserslist allows for Firefox 60 (as confirmed by `npx browserslist`), which does not support `??` (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing).\r\n\r\nUsing newer functions (like `Object.fromEntries`) does also not generate the corresponding polyfills.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding (https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-browser-compatibility) transpiling down and generating polyfills should work out of the box.

It works as expected when the trigger is pressed via keyboard, and in `mat-menu`.\r\nAlthough arrow keys would still move focus to menu items, the biggest impact of this issue is that the menu won't close by `Escape`, since it's the trigger that has the focus, not the overlay.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://material.angular.io/cdk/menu/examples\r\n2. Click on the \"Click me!\" button in one of the last two examples (\"Standalone Trigger\" ones)\r\n3. Press `Escape`.

We stopped because:\r\n\r\n* `@angular/bazel` was updated to no longer produce CommonJS devmode\r\n* It relied on `ts_library` patches to no longer produce CommonJS devmode.\r\n\r\nWe can make these changes to unblock the update, but it would be a significant effort as all `nodejs_binary` targets would need to be updated to execute ESM natively (as there obviously is no CJS anymore). This is what we did as an experiment in framework to run tests/code natively using `.mjs`. We are not going to do it here as we would rather want to put the effort into switching to a toolchain that supports ESM properly.. without patches.\r\n\r\nFor now we are just reversing the change in `ng_module` so that it still produces devmode CommonJS. Components repo will not use for tests etc, but it's there to allow for `nodejs_binary` CommonJS targets, and to avoid having to perform a large migration.

Create a mat-form-field\r\n2. Add a mat-label to this one\r\n3.

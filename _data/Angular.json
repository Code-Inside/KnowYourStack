Navigate to a route that displays (let's call this Route A). `ProjectListPageComponent`\n2. Navigate to a different component/route (Route B), which implicitly causes the from Route A to be destroyed. `ProjectListPageComponent`\n3. From Route B, initiate a navigation to a third route (Route C) that _also_ displays , but with a different `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.data` context. `ProjectListPageComponent`\n4. Observe console logs for and of , paying close attention to unique instance IDs. `ngOnDestroy``ngOnInit``ProjectListPageComponent`\n\n### Observed Behavior\nTo precisely track the lifecycle of component instances and confirm this behavior, a unique was generated for each and logged during both and . The following sequence was consistently observed: `instanceId``ProjectListPageComponent``ngOnInit``ngOnDestroy`\n- **Instance A (`ID: 717725`)**:\n    - : Logs its creation, indicating its context from Route A. `ngOnInit`\n    - : Logs its destruction, correctly reflecting its context from Route A. `ngOnDestroy`\n\n- **Navigation to Route C occurs.**\n- **Unexpected for Instance B (`ID: 910180`)`ngOnDestroy`**:\n    - **Crucially, there was NO log observed for `ID: 910180` that would correspond to its creation within the context of Route C.`ngOnInit`** This instance appears as a \"phantom\" in the logs – it seems to exist only at the point of destruction without a clear preceding initialization for the context it's operating on.\n    - However, its fired. At this point, any internal logic within this that relies on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.data` evaluated based on the data provided by Route C (the _new, incoming_ route), not the data of its original (or seemingly non-existent) context. `ngOnDestroy``ngOnDestroy`\n    - This led to unintended actions, as the component's destruction logic acted on a context it was not initialized in.\n\n- **New Instance C (`ID: 767872`)**:\n    - : Logs its creation, correctly indicating it's in the context of Route C. `ngOnInit`\n\nThis demonstrates a critical timing issue: an is being invoked for a component instance (ID `910180`) that, based on logs, was never properly initialized for the context it then attempts to tear down. Furthermore, when this \"phantom\" runs, it is exposed to the `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.data` of the _new_ route (Route C), leading to incorrect conditional logic execution for that specific, out-of-context instance. `ngOnDestroy``ngOnInit``ngOnDestroy`\n\n### Expected Behavior\nA lifecycle hook should execute its internal logic, particularly when depending on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.data`, using the data that was valid at the time the component instance was initially created (). Component instances that are not explicitly initialized for a certain route context should not execute destruction logic tied to that context, even if the Angular router's global state has advanced. `ngOnDestroy``ngOnInit``ActivatedRoute`\n\n### Hypothesis\nThe issue likely stems from the order of operations during router transitions. It appears that the singleton service might update its to reflect the next, active route _before_ all hooks for components from the outgoing route have fully completed. This allows \"dying\" component instances to incorrectly read the future route's data. `ActivatedRoute``snapshot.data``ngOnDestroy`\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nHere's how this might occur, even with a clean navigation path:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Router Cleanup / Zone.js Interaction:** Angular's router and change detection rely heavily on Zone.js and asynchronous task queues. It's possible that `ProjectListPage [ID: 910180]` was an instance that was created _extremely briefly_ (perhaps due to a rapid, internal, unobserved router event, or even a previous, quickly abandoned navigation to an route that wasn't fully cleaned up). If its destruction was queued asynchronously and only triggered later, it might appear in the logs at a seemingly illogical moment.\n\n3. **Router's Internal Reconciliation:** When the Angular Router initiates a complex navigation, it performs an internal reconciliation. This process identifies which components need to be activated and which need to be deactivated/destroyed. If `910180` existed in the router's internal component tree (even if not actively rendered), this new navigation to _another_ (for `767872`) could have implicitly triggered the final destruction of the old `910180` instance as part of cleaning up the component pool for similar routes. \n\n`ProjectListPage [ID: 910180]`'s being called without any ngOnInit indicates that an instance of with that ID, was present in memory and was ultimately cleaned up by the Angular Router. It is likely an orphaned or lingering instance from a very brief, perhaps unnoticed, prior router state that was finally garbage collected as the router prepared for the creation of the new `ProjectListPageComponent [ID: 767872]`. \n\nIf a component instance is truly being used and rendered by Angular, its lifecycle hook _should_ be called. The fact that I do not see an for `ngOnDestroy` for `ProjectListPage [ID: 910180]` but **no corresponding log for that exact ID`ngOnInit`** means one very important thing: \n**`ProjectListPage [ID: 910180]` was never fully initialized and rendered as an active component by Angular's change detection cycle.**\n\nWhy this happens?:\n1. **Component Instantiation vs. Initialization:** Angular first _instantiates_ a component class (runs its `constructor`) and then, if that component is going to be part of the active view hierarchy, it proceeds to _initialize_ it by calling `ngOnInit` (after all inputs are bound). If a component is instantiated but then immediately discarded or superseded by another navigation before it's \"set up\" for rendering, `ngOnInit` might never be called.\n\n3. **Rapid Router Transitions or Guards:**  - If there's a very quick succession of router events, or if a route guard immediately redirects before the target component can fully initialize, the component might be instantiated in memory only to be immediately abandoned.\n\n3. **Internal Router Reconciliation/Optimization:** \n    - It's possible that `910180` was an internal, transient instance created during a router calculation or an aborted navigation attempt that was never actually put into the DOM and thus never triggered its . `ngOnInit`\n    - When a new, similar route is activated (like navigating to for `767872`), the router might perform a cleanup pass, and `910180`—which was sitting in some internal state—is finally identified as \"stale\" and marked for destruction, leading to its `ngOnDestroy`being called.\n   \nThe presence of `ngOnDestroy` without an `ngOnInit`for `ProjectListPage [ID: 910180]` is a strong indicator that this specific instance of the component was created internally by Angular (or the router), but it never reached the stage of being fully activated and rendered in the view. The `ngOnDestroy` log signifies that Angular's memory management eventually cleaned up this \"un-initialized\" component instance.\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62473","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Phantom component ngOnDestroy running (with no ngOnInit)\" (#62473)"},{"Id":"3203314461","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-04T17:02:55","Actor":"tribet84","Number":"62472","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blank page when serving app with @angular/localize i18n tags after upgrading to Angular 19.2.15","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nAfter upgrading our application from Angular 18 to Angular 19.2.15, we get a completely blank page when running ng serve.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen trying to integrate the `esbuild` based builder into Bazel with `rules_js` we found that it will incorrectly follow symlinks out of the sandbox. This is because Node.js based tooling runs in the output tree to support canonical JS project directory structures. The output tree will contain symlinks outside of the sandbox. Node tooling will generally follow these symlinks, which violates the rules of Bazel sandboxing. This can manifest in a wide variety of errors. One example we encountered with Angular compilation is that the symlinked browser entry point (e.g. `main.ts`) is outside of the range of `tsconfig.json` when the compiler follows the symlink.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nSetting the new `ENABLE_BAZEL_SANDBOX_PLUGIN` environment variable to `true` or `1` during a build with the `esbuild` based builder will now inject a special plugin to make `esbuild` compatible with Bazel builds in the output tree.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe plugin itself was originally written in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_esbuild. The version container in this commit is a fork of https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_esbuild/blob/e4e49d3354cbf7087c47ac9c5f2e6fe7f5e398d3/esbuild/private/plugins/bazel-sandbox.js.

This could be through a dedicated CLI command (e.g., `ng serve --restart-proxy`), a watch mode that only restarts the proxy on config change, or a single pressing to restart it manually just like following picture:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4478d0a-3750-4288-b042-a5a3944dbc48)\n\n\nThis feature would streamline development involving backend APIs and reduce context-switching for developers.\n\n> Created via github copilot agent.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30650","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow restarting Angular proxy server without restarting the full dev server\" (#30650)"},{"Id":"3201366971","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-04T05:06:26","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30651","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)) | dependencies | minor | [`1.13.3` -> `1.15.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@modelcontextprotocol%2fsdk/1.13.3/1.15.0) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | patch | [`4.44.1` -> `4.44.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.44.1/4.44.2) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.44.1` -> `4.44.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.44.1/4.44.2) |\n| [vite](https://vite.dev) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/HEAD/packages/vite)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.0.1` -> `7.0.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/7.0.1/7.0.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk (@&#8203;modelcontextprotocol/sdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.15.0`](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/releases/tag/1.15.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/compare/1.14.0...1.15.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n> \\[!NOTE]\n> This release reverts a [breaking change](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/670) introduced in version [1.13.3](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/releases/tag/1.13.3).\n\n- Allow custom fetch in SSEClientTransport and StreamableHTTPClientTransport by [@&#8203;cliffhall](https://redirect.github.com/cliffhall) in [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/721](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/721)\n- Revert \"fix: add type safety for tool output schemas in ToolCallback\" by [@&#8203;sushichan044](https://redirect.github.com/sushichan044) in [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/725](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/725)\n- bump version to 1.15.0 by [@&#8203;bhosmer-ant](https://redirect.github.com/bhosmer-ant) in [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/730](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/730)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/compare/1.14.0...1.15.0\n\n### [`v1.14.0`](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/releases/tag/1.14.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/compare/1.13.3...1.14.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n> \\[!WARNING]\n> This introduces breaking changes, which are required to comply with the spec -

Currently this is incorrect, because it assumes that a value of `ngtsc` for `source` always means that the error is from the Angular compiler, but what it actually means is that it comes from an Angular template diagnostics. Furthermore, we can't rely on a `source` always being defined.\r\n\r\nThese changes align the logic to a similar one we already have in the compiler where we assume the diagnostic comes from Angular

This is 100% reproducible on the standard documentation page: https://material.angular.dev/components/tabs/overview\n\nUsers found that our WebApp has a sluggish delay when switching between MatTabs and I thought there was some issue with the way we load our components, but no: It turns out there is an underlying issue with how Mat Tabs are. Demonstrated in this video, there is a delay.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3376d4c4-9f3d-4a1d-ba89-c480e5266231\n\nOn chrome, until the tab starts to animate, it takes **~100ms** from the moment of click. But in Mobile Device Emulation mode, you can see that it takes 3 times as long, roughly **~330ms**. This is a bit worse on real iPad hardware, where it take up to **~400ms**, feeling seriously sluggish.\n\nI think this to be a regression, related to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39902055/web-app-feels-less-responsive-when-added-to-iphones-home-screen\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe delay when interacting with Mat Tabs should be the same when using touch, as when using the mouse.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere seems to be a 300ms delay, specifically with MatTabs\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Safari\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, iPad OS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTabs): Touch Delayed on Mobile\" (#31488)"},{"Id":"3196955983","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-02T19:23:13","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"31486","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): add larger touch target","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31486","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): add larger touch target\" (#31486)"},{"Id":"3196854287","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-02T18:38:18","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31485","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): align gm3 colors","State":"open","Body":"Some internal color tokens have changed - this brings them back into spec.

Currently, VoiceOver reads the selected date as “July 3rd, 2025, row X, column X,” but omits the associated day of the week.\n\nThis behavior does not meet [WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html), as the relationship between the date and its corresponding day of the week is not conveyed to assistive technologies.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable VoiceOver via Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver\n2. Open Safari on an iOS device.\n3. Navigate to the Angular Material Datepicker demo page:https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/overview\n4. Open the datepicker by selecting any of the date input fields.\n5. Use VoiceOver to navigate through the calendar and select a date.\n6. The VoiceOver does not read the Day of the Week.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2238c7b-40e8-4956-b879-486c1616ad32)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nVoiceOver should announce the full date, including the day of the week.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nVoiceOver only reads the date and position (e.g., \"July 3rd, 2025, row X, column X\") but does not announce the day of the week, which is visually present in the table header.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18, 20\n- CDK/Material: 18, 20\n- Browser(s): Safari\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):

Violating WCAG 1.3.1\" (#31480)"},{"Id":"3196069333","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-02T14:12:11","Actor":"Julien-Marcou","Number":"31479","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(form-field): label-offset-x is incorrectly computed when there is a prefix","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nInside `_mdc-text-field-structure-overrides.scss`\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/7bb0a82a434c40d01a0d1aa35bcddaa3f725eccb/src/material/form-field/_mdc-text-field-structure-overrides.scss#L97\nWe can see that the variable `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` is hardcoded to -16px (I guess it's coming from the fact that out of the box, form-field have a left-padding of 16px).\n\nBut for outlined form field, the left-padding could get bigger in some cases when using a large value for the border-radius.\n\nThis is because the left-padding is defined with `max(16px, var(--mdc-outlined-text-field-container-shape) + 4px)`\n\nSo if I want my outlined form-fields to be rounded like a pill, I have to override the border-radius with this\n```\n@include mat.form-field-overrides((\n  outlined-container-shape: 28px,\n))\n```\n\nWhich will set the left-padding to 32px and not 16px.\n\n\nAt this point everything looks good, and the label is correctly placed (when empty, it's aligned with the input value/placeholder)\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06337744-3a2c-407d-b4b4-7b6108a000c2\" />\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71516f3f-f5d8-46dd-86f0-45b050a672b0\" />\n\n\nBut things start to break when you add a prefix as it will `translateX` the label to make room for the prefix.\n\nThis transform is based on the hardcoded value of `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: -16px;`, so it works great for out-of-the-box form-field, but doesn't work for my pill form-field.\n\nBecause the padding is set to 32px, the `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` should be -32px and not -16px.\n\nSo I end up with this:\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573b3ef4-afd5-4d02-9394-d99bb8bcdae7\" />\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550dca36-748b-43d0-904e-31a8a653cb19\" />\n\nAs you can see, the empty pill form-field's label isn't aligned anymore with where the input's value is.\n\nI know this can be fixed by overriding the `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` myself by using `::ng-deep` to override the hardcoded value, but it's not something trivial to understand and fix, so I'd rather see a fix in the Angular Material repository.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/tk7fhpq7-w7dz4vdj?file=src%2Fexample%2Fform-field.scss\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe label should be correctly placed when using a large border-radius value for outlined form-field, like the input value is.\n\nI believe the solution would be to change this line of code:\n```diff\n-    --mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: -16px;\n+    --mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: max(16px, var(--mdc-outlined-text-field-container-shape, var(--mat-sys-corner-extra-small)) + 4px) * -1;\n```\n\nBy the way, it would be nice to be able to control the \"minimum\" left & right padding to something else than the hardcoded 16px too 😅 \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe label is not correctly aligned.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.0.4\n- CDK/Material: 20.0.4\n- Browser(s): Chrome 137\n- Operating System:

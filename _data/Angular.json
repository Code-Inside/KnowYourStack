Its in favor of using `.get(InjectionToken<T>)`. The last one does not exactly do the same thing that `.get(token)` does.  `.get(token)` allows you to get dynamically injected services only by their token name, which in my case is saved in the database. Now with the fact that you have to create an `InjectionToken` and share it across modules/libs/projects, this builds unnecessary dependency. Example: \r\n\r\nShared Module: have abstract service \r\nModule2: allow dynamically providing implementations of base service \r\nModule3 or parent module: Implements abstract base services, and provide them to Module2. \r\n\r\nWith `.get(token)` you could just use the name of the service and only depend on the shared module to resolve the services. With `InjectionToken`, you will have to pass the original token from the parent module and import it in Module2, which creates another dependency that we can avoid. \r\n\r\n Example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-injection-token-test?file=src%2Fapp%2Fmodule2%2Fservice-provider.service.ts \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Maybe keep `.get(token)`, or allow `InjectionToken` to have a similar behavior to the `.get(token)`. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Implement a bad design and have circular dependency?

(Angular div)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nAfter investigationg in `stackoverflow` I found out we can not remove `ng-content` (containerless component). \r\nThis is a problem to convert some Bootstrap 4 components (or other CSS frameworks) for example: \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"progress\">\r\n  <div class=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 15%\" aria-valuenow=\"15\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"progress-bar bg-success\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 30%\" aria-valuenow=\"30\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"progress-bar bg-info\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 20%\" aria-valuenow=\"20\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can not create two components `progress-group` and `progress` because inside dives can not accept another div (`ng-content`). Bootstrap 4 does not work in this way.\r\n\r\nExisting `ng-content` for each component destroys the Bootstrap 4 structure I can show you another examples:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"carouselExampleControls\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\r\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img src=\"...\" class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img src=\"...\" class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img src=\"...\" class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"input-group mb-3\">\r\n  <div class=\"input-group-prepend\">\r\n    <span class=\"input-group-text\">$</span>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" aria-label=\"Amount (to the nearest dollar)\">\r\n  <div class=\"input-group-append\">\r\n    <span class=\"input-group-text\">.00</span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a lot more.\r\n\r\nSo I want to ask for **containerless (a component without `ng-content` as a wrapper) feature** for component design system. It can help us to convert a CSS framework to complete Angular toolbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/rU0ed.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDs4M.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtTY7.png\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28132","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support containerless components\" (#28132)"},{"Id":"398984526","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T17:04:47","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"28131","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: build clean windows cache image on master","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [x] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

All dates are one year less than the specified date in the Date var. It is impossible to actually have Year 0 in the Date Pipe. Year 0 will be displayed as 1 BC. 1 BC will be displayed as 2 BC... and so on. Are there any workarounds for this?

I've spent 4 days trying to figure out what the problem is, but all I can tell is that it comes from CommonModule being imported into the module. If I remove that, everything builds fine. In the real-world usage, the components are more complex, but I've been able to create an example in the following repo: https://github.com/trickeyone/angular-error-test\r\n\r\nIt consists of a single component and a single module. The example doesn't have any tests or anything, but the original project that I encountered the issue in has a demo/tests/etc. The demo builds fine. The tests run fine. It's only when I go to build the library that the error happens.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13440","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Including CommonModule causes build to break\" (#13440)"},{"Id":"399146499","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T01:11:42","Actor":"mbward","Number":"13439","RawContent":null,"Title":"uses white foreground text without specifying background text color, hard to read on white terminal","State":"open","Body":"### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.1\r\nNode: 10.13.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\n\r\nSet terminal emulator to use black font on white background\r\n\r\n```\r\nng --version\r\n```\r\n(and various other commands)\r\n\r\nThe logo is red, and the remaining text is a very light gray.\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\n\r\nI can read the text.

debugging purposes. From my understanding the option --vendorSourceMap should allow visibility of these files. However, it is not working.

It is a glob/pattern that specifies which specs should be included in the build. \r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n `ng test --spec=app/services/auth*`\r\n\r\nWhen karma is already running, selected spec can be updated by running following command: \r\n`ng test --spec=app/login* --spec-update`\r\n\r\nFew rules are applied to the pattern to make certain things possible:\r\n* `.spec.ts` is added automatically if missing (less typing)\r\n* if it ends with `*.ts` and doesn't have `.spec.ts`, extension will be replaced with `.spec.ts`\r\n* if path starts at root, source root directory will be trimmed. So that you could use relative file path from editor to make custom tasks to run the command\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes a new `test.generated.ts` is saved next to original `test.ts` which instead of using `require.context` imports all matching files. This gives quite a big boost in the project at work (at least 10s on each iterative build!)\r\n\r\nFixes #3603\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is a pain in a big application to wait until entire app is rebuilt just to run single `fit` block. Takes almost a minute with 4000+ tests and barely works when code coverage is enabled. \r\n\r\nMissing: docs(?)\r\n\r\nExample tasks for vscode:\r\n````\r\n{\r\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n  \"tasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"test selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": []\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"switch selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\",\r\n        \"--spec-update\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n      \"isBackground\": true\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nPS. The setup for writing tests is quite nice!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13423","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/cli): option to build and test only specified spec files\" (#13423)"},{"Id":"398562323","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-12T15:14:46","Actor":"vitoexe","Number":"13422","RawContent":null,"Title":"SCSS/CSS SourceMaps wrong path - contains \"url\" + \"File Location\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.1.4\r\nNode: 10.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.1.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.1.4\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.2.0\r\n@angular/fire                     5.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.22\r\n@angular/material                 7.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.1.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.11.4\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n```\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\n\r\nng serve --aot\r\n\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\nRemove from path to file, url.\r\nOr leave only the relative path.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5330373/51075169-60636200-1688-11e9-9a96-6f3b8b050f74.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13422","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SCSS/CSS SourceMaps wrong path - contains \"url\" + \"File Location\"\" (#13422)"},{"Id":"398545280","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-12T11:17:44","Actor":"MehtaAr25","Number":"13420","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSR with lazy loading does not load Service Modules","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [x ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n$ ng --version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.1\r\nNode: 8.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 6.1.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@angular/fire                     5.1.1\r\n@angular/platform-server          7.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        2.7.2\r\nwebpack                           4.9.2\r\n    \r\n$ node --version\r\nv8.12.0\r\n$ npm --version\r\n6.4.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\nSteps for SSR as mentioned in https://angular.io/guide/universal at end of step 3, when we try to run \r\n\r\n$ ng run my-project:server\r\n\r\nIt gives below error.

It's an easy step to forget when someone adds a new component, or renames them, or moves them to a different subdirectory. Using index.ts files you can get them all exported to a top-level directory, and then iterate over the import to get them all added to your module. This works fine for development but when I run a prod build it thinks I've never imported the components, even though they clearly are. As near as I can tell the only reason for this is that the names don't show up as an explicit import in the file itself.\r\n\r\nI've done some console logging and confirmed that the output of this method is identical to if I just statically add them to the declarations array. There are no stray elements getting in, and every component is listed. \r\n\r\nI assume I'm missing some understanding of how the aot compilation handles index files and how that impacts this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nThis approach only seems to fail for components inside prod/aot builds. For non-prod/aot builds it works fine, for adding services to the module's providers it works, for importing ngrx effects it works. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13416","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dynamic component imports/declarations in prod builds\" (#13416)"},{"Id":"398293633","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-11T14:27:06","Actor":"dougpool","Number":"13413","RawContent":null,"Title":"Object spread in environment files fails for production configuration when used in modules","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [X] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

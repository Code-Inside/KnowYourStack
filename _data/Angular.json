The caller also doesn't have to use `runInInjectionContext` every time when they call the target function anymore.\r\n\r\nWe have successfully used this utility function for the past 8 months in a semi-large project without any issues, so I thought this might be a good addition for the whole community.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] ~Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)~ I couldn't find any tests for `runInInjectionContext`, where I could properly add tests for `bindToInjectionContext`.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, wrapping utility function calls with `runInInjectionContext` is the only way to allow utility functions to use `inject`.\r\n\r\nFor example, say we want to write a simplified way to track clicks in our app (the full example is available as documentation of the `bindToInjectionContext`).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Provide context for where the click happened via the injection context\r\nconst CLICK_AREA = new InjectionToken<string>('click-area');\r\n\r\n// This utility function provides a simplified interface to an imaginary TrackingService. But it\r\n// must be called inside an injection context to work. \r\nfunction trackClick(description: string) {\r\n  const clickArea = inject(CLICK_AREA);\r\n  const tracker = inject(TrackerService);\r\n  tracker.trackClick({\r\n    clickArea,\r\n    description,\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use `trackClick`, callers must ensure, that it is called inside an injection context:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({ /* ... */ })\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  // ⚠️ We create a dependency from this component to Injector, even though\r\n  // we don't need it directly\r\n  private readonly injector = inject(Injector);\r\n\r\n  trackClick(description: string) {\r\n    runInInjectionContext(this.injector, () => trackClick(description));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this once is fine, but having to do this for every component that wants to call the `trackClick` function is repetitive and tedious.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also replace the `inject` calls of the `trackClick` function with parameters, like so:\r\n\r\n ```ts\r\nfunction trackClick(description: string, clickArea: string, tracker: TrackerService) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now the utility function is basically useless. The caller needs to inject both the `CLICK_AREA` and the `TrackerService`. Therefore the caller now needs to know about the services and how to track clicks properly. Might as well just call the `TrackerService` directly.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nWith `bindToInjectionContext`, developers have a much simpler way of calling utility functions, that need to have access to the current injection context.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, `bindToInjectionContext` will take a function and return a new function, that - when called - executes the target function inside the bound injection context. The injection context can be user-controlled, but falls back to the current injection context (via `inject(Injector)`).\r\n\r\nThe above example component can therefore be simplified down to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({ /* ... */ })\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  trackClick = bindToInjectionContext(trackClick);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nOriginally, I wanted the utility function to be called `withInjectionContext`, as it reads nicer. However, I felt like the function name needs to properly communicate that this will bind the given callback to a specific context - just like  [Function.prototype.bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind). Let me know, if you have other opinions or suggestions for names!\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to Angular. I wrote the documentation above the function basically blind, as I don't know how to run a local version of `angular.dev` to check if the code is rendered properly. So please let me know if there is anything broken beside the code itself.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59971","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): add new utility function `bindToInjectionContext`\" (#59971)"},{"Id":"2856057021","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-16T11:58:29","Actor":"aldillek","Number":"59970","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): enhance signal checks to handle negat…","State":"open","Body":"…ed signals\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This change lets it also accept `EnvironmentProviders`, making it easier to customize things like interceptors or backend replacements. `provideHttpClient()` already converts providers to `EnvironmentProviders`, so this just makes the API more consistent. 🚀\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow EnvironmentProviders in HttpFeature for Custom HTTP Client Features\" (#59969)"},{"Id":"2855741423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-15T22:09:59","Actor":"dapperdandev","Number":"59968","RawContent":null,"Title":"rxResource: Expose `request` as WriteableSignal","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\n`resource` and `rxResource` expect a signal for the `request`. \n\n```typescript\nexport interface Post {\n  id?: number;\n  title: string;\n  body: string;\n}\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class PostsService {\n  private readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient);\n\n  public post = signal(null);\n  public createPost= (): ResourceRef<Post> =>\n    rxResource({\n      request: () => this.post(),\n      loader: ({ request }) => {\n        if (!request) return of(null);\n        return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n          'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n          request\n        );\n      },\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThe example above (based on most public examples) demonstrates how this pattern requires the `post` signal to exist outside of the `createPost` function. The service now lacks cohesion since other potential methods/functions are unlikely to utilize the `post` signal. E.g., `getAllPosts()`.\n\nOne workaround is to change the createPost signature to accept a signal parameter:\n\n```typescript\npublic createPost = (post: Signal<Post>) => rxResource({ request: () => post, ... })\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this just moves the cohesion problem to the service consumer.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI believe `request` should be exposed as a `WriteableSignal`:\n\n```typescript\n// service\n ...\n  public createPost = (): ResourceRef<Post> =>\n    rxResource({\n      loader: ({ request }) => {\n        return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n          'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n          request\n        );\n      },\n    });\n ...\n\n// component\n...\nprivate readonly postsService = inject(PostsService);\npublic createPostResource = this.postsService.createPost();\n\npublic createPost(post: Post): void {\n   this.createPostResource.request.set(post);\n}\n```\n\nThis would improve cohesion in services utilizing `rxResource`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs a personal workaround, I extended `ResourceRef` with a `data: WriteableSignal` property. `data` isn't the best name, but `request` was taken :)\n\n```typescript\nexport interface DataResourceRef<T = unknown, U = unknown>\n  extends ResourceRef<T> {\n  data: WritableSignal<U>;\n}\n\nexport interface Post { ... }\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class PostsService {\n  private readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient);\n\n  public createPost = (post: Post): DataResourceRef<Post, Post> => {\n    const data = signal<Post>(post);\n    return {\n      data,\n      ...rxResource({\n        request: () => data(),\n        loader: ({ request }) => {\n          if (!request) return of(null);\n          return this.httpClient.post<Post>(\n            'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',\n            request\n          );\n        },\n      }),\n    };\n  };\n```\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule, JsonPipe],\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class App {\n  private readonly postsService = inject(PostsService);\n  protected createPostResource = this.postsService.createPost(null);\n  protected form = new FormGroup({\n    title: new FormControl(''),\n    body: new FormControl(''),\n  });\n\n  addPost(): void {\n    this.createPostResource.data.set(this.form.getRawValue());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5bqmba9u?file=src%2Fmain.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59968","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"rxResource: Expose `request` as WriteableSignal\" (#59968)"},{"Id":"2855614134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-15T17:21:01","Actor":"Zur13","Number":"59967","RawContent":null,"Title":"Memory Leak on page changes with NgForOf","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nSTR:\n\n1.

Interestingly, the component library builds successfully without needing a module to provide DatePipe.\n\nHowever, the application only runs if I add DatePipe to the providers array in main.ts within my test harness. This shouldn’t be a requirement for a component library—I want to avoid tightly coupling the library to any consuming application in this way.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue:\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce the \"No Provider for DatePipe\" Error in Angular 19 Component Library**\n\n#### **1. Create a New Angular Component Library**\n   - Generate a new Angular workspace with a library:\n     ```sh\n     ng new my-workspace --create-application=false\n     cd my-workspace\n     ng generate library my-lib\n     ```\n   - Navigate to the `projects/my-lib` directory.\n\n#### **2. Create a Component That Uses `DatePipe`**\n   - Inside `projects/my-lib/src/lib/`, create a new component:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate component date-display\n     ```\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to use `DatePipe`:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **3. Ensure `NgModule` is Removed (Standalone Component)**\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to make it a standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       standalone: true,\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **4. Build the Library**\n   - Run:\n     ```sh\n     ng build my-lib\n     ```\n   - The build should succeed without errors.\n\n#### **5. Create a Test Application**\n   - Generate a new Angular application to test the library:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate application test-app\n     ```\n   - Add the library to the application:\n     ```sh\n     ng add my-lib\n     ```\n\n#### **6. Use the Component in the Test Application**\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.html` and add:\n     ```html\n     <lib-date-display></lib-date-display>\n     ```\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.ts` and import the standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DateDisplayComponent } from 'my-lib';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'app-root',\n       standalone: true,\n       imports: [DateDisplayComponent],\n       template: '<lib-date-display></lib-date-display>'\n     })\n     export class AppComponent {}\n     ```\n\n#### **7. Run the Application**\n   ```sh\n   ng serve test-app\n   ```\n   - **Expected Behavior:** The app should run without issues.\n   - **Actual Behavior:** A runtime error occurs:  \n     ```\n     Error: NG0203: No provider for DatePipe!\n     ```\n\n#### **8. Workaround: Add `DatePipe` to `main.ts`**\n   - Modify `test-app/src/main.ts` to provide `DatePipe` globally:\n     ```typescript\n     import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n     import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';\n     import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n       providers: [DatePipe]\n     });\n     ```\n   - **Now the application runs correctly.**\n\n### **Issue Summary**\n- The component library builds successfully.\n- Despite providing `DatePipe` at the component level, Angular still throws a \"No Provider\" error at runtime.\n- The app only works when `DatePipe` is provided at the application level (`main.ts`), which **forces tight coupling** between the library and the consuming application.\n\n### **Expected Behavior**\n- Since `DatePipe` is provided in the standalone component, the app should not require an additional provider in `main.ts`.\n- The component library should be self-contained and not require the consuming application to explicitly provide `DatePipe`.\n\nLet me know if you need any refinements! 🚀\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_MapMainComponent])[_MapMessageService -> _MapMessageService -> _MapToolsMenubarComponent -> _MenuBarImportService -> _MenuBarImportService -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for _DatePipe!\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.7\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.7\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.7 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.7\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\n@angular/cli                    19.1.7\n@angular/language-service       19.1.6\n@angular/localize               19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.7\nng-packagr                      19.1.2\nrxjs                            6.6.7\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng19 Component Library Components not recognizing provider DatePipe\" (#59963)"},{"Id":"2854455841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T19:14:24","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"59961","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] build: update babel dependencies to v7.26.9","State":"closed","Body":"This is a Patch PR of #59743\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following updates:\r\n\r\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.0` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.26.0/7.26.9) |\r\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.5` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.26.5/7.26.9) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/core)</summary>\r\n\r\n### [`v7.26.9`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7269-2025-02-14)\r\n\r\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.26.8...v7.26.9)\r\n\r\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\r\n\r\n-   `babel-types`\r\n    -

But it is tabbable\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFirst tabbable element should receive focus\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFirst tabbable element does not receive focus, bottom sheet container receives focus instead.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(bottom-sheet): auto focus defaults to dialog instead of first-tabbable\" (#30483)"},{"Id":"2848974253","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:55:05","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30482","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30482","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30482)"},{"Id":"2848952237","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:46:51","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30481","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.1.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30481","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.1.4 release\" (#30481)"},{"Id":"2848945875","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:41:05","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30480","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.1.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30480","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.1.4\" with changelog.\" (#30480)"},{"Id":"2848902287","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:21:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30479","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): allow scroll strategy to be customized","State":"closed","Body":"**Note:** This is a cherry-pick of #30473.\r\n\r\nAdds an injection token to the timepicker that allows the scroll strategy to be customized, similar to other components.\r\n\r\nFixes #30421.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30479","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/timepicker): allow scroll strategy to be customized\" (#30479)"},{"Id":"2847542954","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:16:13","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30473","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): allow scroll strategy to be customized","State":"closed","Body":"Adds an injection token to the timepicker that allows the scroll strategy to be customized, similar to other components.\r\n\r\nFixes #30421.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30473","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/timepicker): allow scroll strategy to be customized\" (#30473)"},{"Id":"2847889111","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T17:14:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30474","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/overlay): avoid issues with overlapping backdrop removals","State":"closed","Body":"Prior to #30179 the overlay ref was able to handle multiple backdrops being removed at the same time, because we didn't need to retain any state about them, aside from the DOM node.

Then we translate them to Material 3 color palettes with the `var()` function of CSS. The colorpalettes will be the implemented like following:\n\n```SCSS\n:root {\n  --my-selector-0: #000000,\n  ....\n  --my-neutral-0: #000000,\n}\n\n$_palettes: (\n  primary: (\n    0: var(--my-selector-0),\n    10: var(--my-selector-10),\n    20: var(--my-selector-25),\n    25: var(--my-selector-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n  neutral: (\n    0: var(--my-neutral-0),\n    10: var(--my-neutral-10),\n    20: var(--my-neutral-25),\n    25: var(--my-neutral-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n)\n```\n\nBut the `mat.theme` mixin generates transparencies of `neutral-0` which doesn't work, because the is a function which converts the Hex-Color into RGB and then sets the transparency.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a theme with `ng generate @angular/material:theme-color`\n2. Change the `neutral` with hue `0` to a CSS variable which you have defined at root level and set its color to e.g. `#000000`\n3. start the app with\n4. inspect the the `--mat-sys-level` variables\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to insert the transparency RGB colors needed for the `--mat-sys-level1` variables into the `mat.theme` mixin to get working box shadows for e.g. buttons.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInstead of a fancy transparency the `var(--my-neutral-0)` will be shown and the box shadow looks really dark deep and black\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.5\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.3\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theme): mat.theme doesn't support color palettes with CSS variables\" (#30476)"},{"Id":"2848035893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T13:06:44","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30475","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular/dev-infra digest to 8a438a3 - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `515b575` -> `8a438a3` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

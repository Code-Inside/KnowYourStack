Note the error shown above.\n\nWorkarounds:\nUse Zoneless change detection and not load `zone.js/node` in the `main.server.ts` file.\n\nOr\n\nConfigure Vite to use the legacy sass compiler\n\n```ts\n/// <reference types=\"vitest\" />\n\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport analog from '@analogjs/platform';\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({\n  build: {\n    target: ['es2020'],\n  },\n  css: {\n    preprocessorOptions: {\n      scss: {\n        api: 'legacy' // fixes the error, but displays deprecation warnings\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    mainFields: ['module'],\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    analog(),\n  ],\n}));\n```\n\nUsing the modern sass compiler out of the box is preferred.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/brandonroberts/analog-angular-material-zonejs\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n<img width=\"1179\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e5a7a8-e89a-4353-91dc-c481910d7c6e\" />\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.10\n@angular/build                  19.2.10\n@angular/cdk                    19.2.14\n@angular/cli                    19.2.10\n@angular/material               19.2.14\n@schematics/angular             19.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nUsing Analog 1.16.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61090","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Importing zone.js/node and using modern sass compiler throws an error with Vite/AnalogJS\" (#61090)"},{"Id":"3033852900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T17:31:48","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61084","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies to v20.0.0-next.10","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | patch | [`20.0.0-next.8` -> `20.0.0-next.10`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk/20.0.0-next.8/20.0.0-next.10) |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | patch | [`20.0.0-next.8` -> `20.0.0-next.10`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/20.0.0-next.8/20.0.0-next.10) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.10`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next10-sodium-swallow-2025-05-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.0.0-next.9...20.0.0-next.10)\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.9`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next9-sodium-salamander-2025-05-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.0.0-next.8...20.0.0-next.9)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### cdk\n\n-   -   `CanStick` has been removed.\n    -   `CDK_TABLE_TEMPLATE` has been removed.\n    -   `StickyDirection` has been removed.\n    -   `StickyStyler` has been removed.\n\n##### cdk-experimental\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [e456c751c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/e456c751cdeff2f196e90933d4c99de317e70b31) | feat | **listbox:** add cdk-active class ([#&#8203;30932](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30932)) |\n| [96fa9fc55](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/96fa9fc5526e79127edf028eef88f547c8c93b88) | feat | **popover-edit:** Support skipping over annotated rows when the user moves focus up/down.

To name a few:\r\n\r\n- Directive-only search –  Wrapping the text in square brackets (i.e. `[MyDirective]`) will target only the directives\r\n- Component + directive search – Currently, the filtering performs a generic string matching, so nodes like `app-todo[Tooltip CtxMenu]` can only be matched if the the whole or part of the strings is matched. This update will allow for matching the given example with filters like `app-todo[CtxMenu]`, `todo[Menu]`, etc. Basically, each segment (directive of component) is filtered/checked individually.\r\n\r\n**Work in progress:**\r\n- [x] Implementation\r\n- [ ] Fixing existing and introducing new tests\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61085","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): introduce a more sophisticated directive forest filter\" (#61085)"},{"Id":"3032903459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T12:59:04","Actor":"ThiloAschebrock","Number":"61082","RawContent":null,"Title":"Directive Validators Not Emitting StatusChanges","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen combining directive validators (via `NG_VALIDATORS`) with reactive forms, these change the `status` of the reactive form but do not emit a corresponding `statusChanges` unless paired with a user interaction.\n\nThe simplest example is an input field that is assigned the `required` validator directive and initialised with an empty string. In this case the initial `status` of the form control changes from `VALID` to `INVALID`, as expected, but no `statusChanges` event is emitted.\n\nThe same behaviour is also present, when setting the form value programatically outside of user interactions, e.g., in life-cycle methods such a `ngOnInit`.\n\nWhen there is, however, a value change triggered by direct user interaction or indirect user interaction, e.g., pressing a button that programmatically sets the form value, the expected status is emitted as `statusChange`.\n\nNote that whenever `statusChanges` are unexpectedly not emitted a corresponding `events` emission is also missing.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-query-aqv6yuzm-vfbygddo?file=package.json,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nException: Form status changes from `VALID` to `INVALID` while emitting a `statusChanges` event.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.10\n@angular/build               19.2.10\n@angular/cli                 19.2.10\n@schematics/angular          19.2.10\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn case this is expected behaviour, it should be mentioned in the documentation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61082","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Directive Validators Not Emitting StatusChanges\" (#61082)"},{"Id":"3033276229","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T09:33:04","Actor":"egonknapen","Number":"61083","RawContent":null,"Title":"Keep the ngIf + ngFor, don't deprecate them","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe new preferred syntax (@if, @for), although nice in some cases, turns the template into a tangled, unreadable mess, stripping away its clarity and charm.\n\nIf you like me have heavy use of lots of *ngIf below each other, the whole template gets filled with { ... }.

This is not my concern.\nMy concern is how you need to override css in order to achieve the **styling** for this pattern.\n\n### Use Case\n\nMy goal is to avoid custom selector overrides, digging into pseudo elements etc. as it make the project susceptible to any internal naming changes etc.\n\nBelow is the minimal fix that I am using currently (maybe there's a better solution, IDK)\n\n```css\nbutton.mat-mdc-menu-trigger[aria-expanded=\"true\"] {\n  .mat-mdc-button-persistent-ripple.mdc-icon-button__ripple:before {\n    opacity: var(--mat-icon-button-pressed-state-layer-opacity);\n  }\n} \n```\n\nThis is basically overriding material's identical selector:\n\n```\nopacity: var(--mat-icon-button-hover-state-layer-opacity, var(--mat-sys-hover-state-layer-opacity))\n```\n\nand even if you choose to make your own directive that injects MatMenuTrigger on host, listens to the events and appends a custom class, you'd still have to define this custom class more or less like in the example. And I see this css override too internal and problematic. Therefore I would love it if material could come to the rescue and do what it can natively, such as - maybe - add an input `[pressedWhileOpen]=\"true\"`\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31014","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MENU): Native material way to maintain MatMenuTrigger pressed state\" (#31014)"},{"Id":"3036282355","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T15:23:38","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"31013","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/testing): cleanup apis for landing on adev","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31013","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(cdk/testing): cleanup apis for landing on adev\" (#31013)"},{"Id":"3035692464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T12:17:21","Actor":"moniuch","Number":"31012","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(TABS): Better support for faceless mat-tabs usage","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nI'd like to ask for a better `MatTabGroup` support for using the component in a faceless manner\n\n1. add a faceless mode so that the `mat-tab-header` is not rendered - without need to hiding it via css `::ng-deep` - this always feels a wrong thing to do - exposing oneself to any changes being breaking)\n\n2. add `focusTabById(id: string)` method to enable navigation by `MatTab` `id` - since the docs rightfully put the responsibility on the consumer to make sure ids are unique, this very same responsibility would also be extended here, to make sure that this method would pick the right, unique tab.\n\n3. expose the collection of tab ids so that consumer can grab a `viewChild` reference and iterate the collection and associate it with index. This could be an alternative to adding the method (2)\n\n### Use Case\n\nI need to use MatTabs in a faceless mode, meaning - tab header not rendered. The reason is I want to  leverage the lazy loading of `mat-tab-content`, and I need to control the tabs programmatically from a custom component. What makes it hard is that the only method currently available is via index - an id-based activation would be more reliable a logical extension of allowing custom ids.

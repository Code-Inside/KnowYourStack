Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v14.1.1...v14.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   added the `modern-compiler` value for API to reuse compiler process ([#&#8203;1195](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/1195)) ([cef40a8](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/cef40a8af9891adca9fc99d9641b46dc58db023f))\n-   support webpack built-in resolver for `modern` and `modern-compiler` API ([#&#8203;1197](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/1197)) ([2265b72](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/2265b72c4899a6784e0785938f892743d1c942bf))\n\nNotes:\n\nUsing the `modern-compiler` value for the `api` option together with `sass-embedded` reduces compilation time by 5-10 times, especially for projects using large files with a lot of `@import`/`@use`, for small files the build time reduction will not be significant.\n\n##### [14.1.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v14.1.0...v14.1.1) (2024-02-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   handle `pkg:` scheme

During adding the sort functionality to the tables I've experienced very strange behaviors of MatSort. In some components the setter of MatSort is executed multiple times and in other components just once.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I have to handle the MatSort in components where it's only set once differently as in the components where it's set multiple times.\r\n\r\nI've searched for reasons. But haven't found any. The strange thing is that two of all components are almost the same but in one component the MatSort's setter is executed multiple times and in the other just once. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nI don't know how I can reproduce the bug, because both components I speak about in the description set the table's data-source initially `public dataSource = new MatTableDataSource<Data2>();` and overwrite it after the data is set asynchron` this.dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(this.data);`. In some components the MatSort's setter is exeuted again if this.dataSource has been overwritten. \r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-omvcop?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponent-two%2Fcomponent-two.component.ts\r\n\r\nIn the Stackblitz you can see that I have to assign the matSort's-value to a private property in **component one** where I load the data asynchron. \r\n\r\nIn **component two** the data is loaded synchron and the mat-sort works from the beginning. **Important**: In my application the data in component2 is loadad asynchon too, but has the behavior as if I would load the data synchron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality and behavior has to work for asynchron loaded data equal.  \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality is different between two components that load the data asynchron. In one of them it works and in the other it doesn't\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^15.5.1\r\n- CDK/Material: ^15.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28873","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"MatSort: Setter is executed multiple times in some components and just once in other components\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2235940153","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-12T14:52:24","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"28855","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: replace incorrect word in M3 theming guide","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #28823 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28855","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: replace incorrect word in M3 theming guide\" (#28855)"},{"Id":"2237242049","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-12T14:45:58","Actor":"NCC1701M","Number":"28861","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-selection-list): A List with single selection still writes an array instead an single value","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nnot tested\n\n### Description\n\nWhen you are using `[(ngModel)]` on a `mat-selection-list` which is configured to only select a single option, `ngModel` still writes an array value instead of a single value.\r\n\r\nWhen a value is selected, the selected values json representation is displayed e.g. `[ \"Sneakers\" ]`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/xh9gxz-ae2ipa\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

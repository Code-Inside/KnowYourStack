This doesn't work for something like `elementStart`, because we have to descend into other elements that could add to the chain.\r\n\r\nThese changes refactor the code so that we collect the list of instructions in a flat array and we do the chaining only once at the end when we have the entire instruction set for the code block.\r\n\r\nThe new approach has the advantage of being (almost) entirely configuration-based via the `CHAINABLE_INSTRUCTIONS` array and being more flexible in allowing us to chain instructions that span across elements.\r\n\r\n2. **perf(compiler): chain element start/end instructions** \r\n\r\nIn templates with several levels of nested nodes, it's common for several `elementStart`/`elementEnd` instructions to show up in a row which can be optimized away.\r\n\r\nThese changes add chaining support for `elementStart`, `elementEnd`, `elementContainerStart` and `elementContainerEnd` to shave off some bytes when possible.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44994","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Chain elementStart/elementEnd instructions\" (#44994)"},{"Id":"1125649691","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-07T08:14:20","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"44993","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I am in the process of updating from Angular 10.x (where things build fine) to 13.x (where things are breaking), but it's unclear if this is a regression.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have two Angular library projects in a monorepo. Project B depends on Project A. Both are pretty small. When attempting to build both, Project A builds successfully but Project B fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/error\" must be string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's unclear what schema the error is referring to and it's also unclear what `Data path \"/error\"` is referring to. If \"schema\" refers to `angular.json` in this context, it's unclear what `Data path \"/error\"` is referring to since an \"error\" key isn't documented for `angular.json`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nClone the [angular-cli-build-bug](https://gitlab.com/service-work/is-loading/-/tree/angular-cli-build-bug) branch of my `service-work/is-loading` repo. The repo contains a [`.devcontainer.json` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) which can be used to quickly setup the dev environment.\r\n\r\n1. run `yarn install`\r\n2. (optional) run `yarn test`. Tests should all pass.\r\n3. run `yarn build`. The `@service-work/is-loading` project should build successfully but the `@service-work/scroll-position` library should fail with the following message:\r\n   ```\r\n   Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n     Data path \"/error\" must be string.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nNote that the `@service-work/scroll-position` package depends on the `@service-work/is-loading` package. However, the only file in `@service-work/scroll-position` that actually imports from `@service-work/is-loading` is the `projects/scroll-position/src/scroll-position/module/directive/scroll-position.directive.ts` file. If you comment out the `@service-work/is-loading` import in that file, as well as the related code, then the `@service-work/scroll-position` file builds without error.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear if there's something wrong in my code which is preventing the project from building (in which case the provided error message should be improved to make clear what the problem is) or if there's a bug with the build script.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/error\" must be string.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.2.2\r\nNode: 12.22.7\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.15\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1302.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.2.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.2.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.2.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n- This repo is managed as a Yarn 1.x workspace. \r\n- I don't think this is actually relevant, but I'll mention that my development computer is a M1 Pro Macbook Pro that is running an `x86_64` devcontainer using qemu.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44999","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`FatalDiagnosticError` is being throw instead of it being converted to a`ts.Diagnostic`\" (#44999)"},{"Id":"1126241331","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-05T17:03:53","Actor":"rjanma","Number":"45000","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: open @see link online documentation from VSCode","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

I read all about CVA and sub forms with inputs etc... They seemed to miss something. At the beginning I was sure CVA would be the best fit which almost was the case. The problem started when I needed to render parts of the form in tabs yet all of them created together one form. For the sake of the explanation let's take a simple date range component as an example. The control has built in validation to make sure the `from` field isn't greater than the `to` field. At some point I loaded an invalid form (wrong date range) due to business requirements to the form yet the form was valid. The reason was the CVA component included the validation yet it wasn't rendered. That brought me to think the missing part was the decoupling of form logic from the UI. In regular reactive forms it works well - in the TS you add controls and validators and only bind it to the html which doesn't necessarily need to be rendered. In the CVA or sub forms \"land\" the form and UI is coupled together.\r\nThe feature request I thought is why not create a class called `DateRangeFormControl` extending `AbstractControl`. The whole form logic with validations will be there while the UI will be in the component.\r\nThis allows us a few benefits:\r\n1. Decoupled logic and UI - will solve the CVA validation problem from above\r\n2. Possible reusability with different components\r\n3. Still easily apply through `formControlName` and use inside say a form group in the parent\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nHaving the possibility to create custom form controls and restrict components to accept specific custom control types in `formControlName`/ `formControl` or something similar.\r\nFor example if it was implemented:\r\n1. A component called `date-range.component.ts` exists.\r\n2. Adding another file near it called `date-range.form.ts` which contains:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class DateRangeFormControl extends AbstractContol {\r\n  // Implements DateRange specific logic here - model + validation + maybe custom functions\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. `DateRangeComponent` would implement CVA (or another interface?) and declare it only accepts `DateRangeFormControl` somehow so it can safely use its functions and structure.\r\n4. In the parent component the ts declaration will be:\r\n```ts\r\nform = new FormGroup({\r\n  one: new FormControl('...'),\r\n  two: new DateRangeFormControl({from: ..., to: ...})\r\n})\r\n```\r\n5. In the parent HTML the declaration will be:\r\n```html\r\n<app-date-range formControlName/customFormControlName=\"two\"></app-date-range>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are still a few things which require more thought - How to restrict to certain controls in a component? Can we use the same form directives? Is CVA the correct interface here (as we want to decouple the form logic yet CVA requires functions like `setValue` to be implemented on the component)? Probably using form group inside the custom form component is required yet how to achieve it as it should act as a form control to the outside? And I believe many more... \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n1. Regular CVA while hiding with display none instead of ngif\r\n2. Pass form as input from parent\r\n3.

It's also an NX monorepo.\r\n\r\nI've just upgraded to Angular 13 (using `nx migrate` and the prod builds and main application serve are all working as expected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the small UI component app is not working with serve. Previously our script command in package.json used to use the `--base-href` flag, but now in Angular 13 this has been removed and gives message:\r\n\r\n> 'baseHref' is not found in schema\r\n\r\nSo I have removed the `--base-href` flag from the command in package.json.\r\n\r\nI've tried adding the exact same config to the angular.json file in the root of the project, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"build\": {\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n        \"baseHref\": \"/component-guide\",\r\n        // rest of config\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this has not worked. The actual serve command completes successfully, but when I try to hit my app in the browser at URL `localhost/component-guide` it just goes crazy and reloads like every 10 milliseconds (it is just reloading like crazy, the favicon is actually flashing, never seen anything like it)\r\n\r\nI also tried adding the same `baseHref` config to the project.json file in the apps/component-guide folder (and having it in both angular.json and project,json individually and at the same time).\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but there isn't a _minimal reproduction_ - my project is enormous and contains not just one but two separate applications.

Because in function

[`v0.14.18`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01418)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.17...v0.14.18)\n\n-   Add the `--mangle-cache=` feature ([#&#8203;1977](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1977))\n\n    This release adds a cache API for the newly-released `--mangle-props=` feature. When enabled, all mangled property renamings are recorded in the cache during the initial build. Subsequent builds reuse the renamings stored in the cache and add additional renamings for any newly-added properties. This has a few consequences:\n\n    -   You can customize what mangled properties are renamed to by editing the cache before passing it to esbuild (the cache is a map of the original name to the mangled name).\n\n    -   The cache serves as a list of all properties that were mangled. You can easily scan it to see if there are any unexpected property renamings.\n\n    -   You can disable mangling for individual properties by setting the renamed value to `false` instead of to a string. This is similar to the `--reserve-props=` setting but on a per-property basis.\n\n    -   You can ensure consistent renaming between builds (e.g. a main-thread file and a web worker, or a library and a plugin). Without this feature, each build would do an independent renaming operation and the mangled property names likely wouldn't be consistent.\n\n    Here's how to use it:\n\n    -   CLI\n\n        ```sh\n        $ esbuild example.ts --mangle-props=_$ --mangle-cache=cache.json\n        ```\n\n    -   JS API\n\n        ```js\n        let result = await esbuild.build({\n          entryPoints: ['example.ts'],\n          mangleProps: /_$/,\n          mangleCache: {\n            customRenaming_: '__c',\n            disabledRenaming_: false,\n          },\n        })\n        let updatedMangleCache = result.mangleCache\n        ```\n\n    -   Go API\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          EntryPoints: []string{\"example.ts\"},\n          MangleProps: \"_$\",\n          MangleCache: map[string]interface{}{\n            \"customRenaming_\":   \"__c\",\n            \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n          },\n        })\n        updatedMangleCache := result.MangleCache\n        ```\n\n    The above code would do something like the following:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = {\n      customRenaming_: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      otherProp_: 3,\n    }\n\n    // Generated code\n    x = {\n      __c: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      a: 3\n    };\n\n    // Updated mangle cache\n    {\n      \"customRenaming_\": \"__c\",\n      \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n      \"otherProp_\": \"a\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add `opera` and `ie` as possible target environments\n\n    You can now target [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) and/or [Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx) using the `--target=` setting. For example, `--target=opera45,ie9` targets Opera 45 and Internet Explorer 9. This change does not add any additional features to esbuild's code transformation pipeline to transform newer syntax so that it works in Internet Explorer. It just adds information about what features are supported in these browsers to esbuild's internal feature compatibility table.\n\n-   Minify `typeof x !== 'undefined'` to `typeof x < 'u'`\n\n    This release introduces a small improvement for code that does a lot of `typeof` checks against `undefined`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    y = typeof x !== 'undefined';\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x!=\"undefined\";\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x<\"u\";\n    ```\n\n    This transformation is only active when minification is enabled, and is disabled if the language target is set lower than ES2020 or if Internet Explorer is set as a target environment. Before ES2020, implementations were allowed to return non-standard values from the `typeof` operator for a few objects. Internet Explorer took advantage of this to sometimes return the string `'unknown'` instead of `'undefined'`. But this has been removed from the specification and Internet Explorer was the only engine to do this, so this minification is valid for code that does not need to target Internet Explorer.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>csstools/postcss-plugins</summary>\n\n### [`v7.3.1`](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/blob/HEAD/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;731-February-3-2022)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/compare/51bfb76c1c427bd953f4816dab4ea1c759b60a85...15a2fbaf6330ed49d76af5b1f60d2ace92e83349)\n\n-   Ensured that `debug` option uses a single instance per run, this allows for `debug` to work on parallel runs within CI environments.\n-   Normalized exports to support both Common JS and ESM within our modules.

This applies to `if` that do not have an `else`: these used to be counted as two branches, and they are now counted as one. This artificially increases branch coverage.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStarting from a minimal reproduction repository (`ng new`), make the following changes:\r\n1. Add `src/foo.ts`. Note that this function contains two branches to cover: the if, and the (non-explicitly written) else.\r\n```\r\nexport function foo(n: number) {\r\n  if (n % 2 === 0) {\r\n    console.log('hello');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Add `src/foo.spec.ts`:\r\n```\r\nimport { foo } from './foo';\r\n\r\ndescribe('test', () => {\r\n  it('test', () => {\r\n    foo(2);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n3. Restrict the test suite to run only `foo.spec.ts` in `src/test.ts`:\r\n```\r\nconst context = require.context('./', true, /foo\\.spec\\.ts$/);\r\n```\r\n4. Launch the tests with code coverage: `npx ng test --code-coverage`\r\n5. The output reports full coverage, of only one branch:\r\n```\r\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\r\nStatements   : 100% ( 2/2 )\r\nBranches     : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nLines        : 100% ( 2/2 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor comparison, downgrading to Angular 12 and to Typescript 4.3.5 results in the correct coverage report, which is:\r\n```\r\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\r\nStatements   : 100% ( 5/5 )\r\nBranches     : 50% ( 1/2 )\r\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nLines        : 100% ( 5/5 )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\nEverything comes from the default app when running `ng new`\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.2.2\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1302.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.2.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.2\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22652","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Branch coverage data is incorrect after upgrading to Angular 13\" (#22652)"},{"Id":"1124337742","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-04T15:50:04","Actor":"gatos-cc","Number":"22651","RawContent":null,"Title":"New app generation requires git","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n11, although was also running into bug with `ng new` there - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/21326\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nWhen I run `ng new <appname>` on a system without git installed, it fails.

regression?\r\n\r\nThis was working in Angular <=10 because the \"ora\" package was not used to create a beautiful spinner in the console stream.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe ora spinner is using **process.stderr** as default stream which causes some test runners to fail the entire test execution because there was something written to the stdErr output.\r\nThis behavior can be changed to use **process.stdout** instead which should be enough for this kind of logging.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nusing e.g. karma 6.3.12\r\n\r\nng test any-library-you-want-to\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThere is no actual issue, but this is what the spinner is used for in the test command:\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\\ Generating browser application bundles (phase: building)...\r\n√ Browser application bundle generation complete.</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nI'm sure the spinner is used in other commands, too. But for the most uses cases (e.g. local development) writing to strErr stream is not relevant except for testing strategies. An issue in the stdErr stream could cause test runners to declare the run as failed even all tests succeeded.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Angular CLI: 11.2.0\r\nNode:

You can use it on macOS by installing Safari Technology Preview 15.4. You can use it on iOS by installing iOS 15.4 Beta.\r\n2.

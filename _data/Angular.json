Such reexports are mainly generated to satisfy strict dependency condition for generated files. Such condition is no longer the case for G3. At the same time, these alias reexports make it impossible to mix locally compiled targets with globally compiled targets. More precisely, a globally compiled target may not be able to consume a locally compiled target as its dependency since the former may import from the alias reexports which do not exist in the latter due to local compilation mode. So, to make global-local compilation interop possible, it is required to be able to turn off alias reexport generation.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

expectation.\r\n\r\nAdding this option in `jasmine.json` with Jasmine 5.1.0 works.\r\n\r\nThe same option does not work with Angular when adding the option in `karma.conf.js`.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng new app --defaults\r\ncd app\r\nng g config karma\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd `stopSpecOnExpectationFailure: true` to the config object in

https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/Configuration.html\r\n        // for example, you can disable the random execution with `random: false`\r\n        // or set a specific seed with `seed: 4321`\r\n        stopSpecOnExpectationFailure: true,\r\n        random: false\r\n      },\r\n      clearContext: false // leave Jasmine Spec Runner output visible in browser\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** I added `random: false` as well to make sure that the issue is option-specific.\r\n\r\nAdd a spec with a failing expectation:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndescribe('Test', () => {\r\n  it('1', () => {\r\n    expect(true).toBe(false);\r\n    console.log('This should not be logged!');\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally run `ng test` and check the logs.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ng

Is there a parameter to configure the GLOBAL heap used by NodeJS process for building phase ? If not, I think it could be useful to have one, and/or be able to fine-tune memory for all V8 isolates with high memory consumption\r\n\r\n- I cannot find any documentation explaning the fact that \"production > optimization > scripts\" option can result in high memory consumption, why it takes such memory, how I could tune it. Is is possible to have such a documentation / explanation ?\r\n\r\n- I also found this issue about memory limits for several \"V8 isolates\" in NodeJS, and was wondering whether it could be linked to my issue : https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43991\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNote : I was also facing same issue with Angular 14 : \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26553\r\n\n\n###

Description\n\nI'm encountering an issue with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/). Despite the package appearing to load successfully, the terminal outputs the following error message every time the server reloads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load url /~partytown/partytown.js (resolved id: /~partytown/partytown.js). Does the file exist?\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant setup in my `angular.json`:\r\n```JSON\r\n  \"assets\": [\r\n    \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n    \"src/assets\",\r\n    {\r\n      \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n      \"input\": \"node_modules/@builder.io/partytown/lib\",\r\n      \"output\": \"/~partytown\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe peculiar aspect is that the package seems to load correctly. Console messages confirm the package's presence and activity. This discrepancy between the terminal error and the actual functionality is puzzling. I'm curious if this is a known issue or a misconfiguration on my end. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nTo reproduce:\r\n- create a new project with the latest version of angular\r\n   - Setup SSR (`ng add @angular/ssr`)\r\n- Install and setup partytown\r\n- run `ng serve`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nFailed to load url /~partytown/partytown.js (resolved id: /~partytown/partytown.js).

I did not expect.\r\n\r\nI have a package in node_module that exports an enum like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n(function (MyEnum) {\r\n    MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"c\";\r\n})(MyEnum || (exports.MyEnum = MyEnum = {}));\r\n```\r\nI use it in my code like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {MyEnum} from '@my-package';\r\n\r\nconst MyEnumTitlesMap = new Map<MyEnum, string>([\r\n  [MyEnum.A, 'title for A'],\r\n  [MyEnum.B, 'title for B'],\r\n  [MyEnum.C, 'title for C'],\r\n]);\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n  ...\r\n  myMethod() {\r\n    const title = MyEnumTitlesMap.get(MyEnum.A)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTypescript recognizes the enum `MyEnum` but at runtime `MyEnum` is undefined. \r\n\r\nWhen I look a the generated bundle using @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser  as builder,  with `buildOptimized: true` the genrated bundle has \r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyEnum = /*#__PURE__*/(() => {\r\n  MyEnum = MyEnum || {};\r\n  MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"d\";\r\n  return MyEnum;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nMyEnum is no longer exported, that's why at runtime it's undefined.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nI have spent 4 days trying to reproduce in a simple project but I couldn't.\r\nWhat I have is a commonJs package on npm registry which I install using yarn on my angular 16 project, the packag exports an enum which I can only use if It's inside the component for example a public property of the component and not in a const outside the component, in which case it gets tree shaken.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the enum, and it wouldn't be tree-shaken.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have been unable to reproduce myself.\n\n###

We would like to see a similar implementation to the solution provided for tailwind by looking for a specific config file such as `rtlcss.config` and adding it to the list of postcss plugins if it exists.\r\n\r\nA similar approach on how angular handles the [tailwind plugin ](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e871f87fa2eda5cdf74557b95b47aa419e53e17b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L164)\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently we were relying on custom webpack overriding libraries such as [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus), however these are broken with the new build system and therefore it would be best if angular provide an official support for rtlcss plugin","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add support for postcss-rtlcss for angular build\" (#26867)"},{"Id":"2080874518","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-14T19:54:30","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"26866","RawContent":null,"Title":"new text loader in 17.1.0-rc.1 doesn't load files from node_modules","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUsing the new loader support in version 17.1 to load the content of a file as text using an import statement works fine, but not when the file is under node_modules, unless using a complete relative path such as `../../node_modules/bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the path that looks more logical to me (`bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg`), then the CLI outputs a warning in the console:\r\n\r\n> Cannot optimize dependency: bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg, present in 'optimizeDeps.include'\r\n\r\nand instead of loading the file content, it loads the text `/@fs/home/projects/stackblitz-starters-ycv7cm/repro/node_modules/bootstrap-icons/icons/save.svg`\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ycv7cm?file=repro%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n- cd repro\r\n- npm i\r\n- ng serve\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0-rc.1\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.4.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0-rc.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0-rc.1\r\n@angular/cli                    17.1.0-rc.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0-rc.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26866","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"new text loader in 17.1.0-rc.1 doesn't load files from node_modules\" (#26866)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2087338156","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-18T02:10:28","Actor":"wilson3q","Number":"28447","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(dialog): Material dialog enter/leave animation breaks in 17.1.0","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.0.6\n\n### Description\n\nThe material dialog enter/leave transition animation does not work in new release.

Among others, this library includes custom components which are to be opened inside a dialog. Here is what the module of such a component looks like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [MyComponent],\r\n  imports: [MatDialogModule],\r\n  export: [MyComponent],\r\n})\r\nexport class MyModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor applications which use that component in an NgModule, this works fine. However one of the applications is in the progress of migrating to standalone. After making the component standalone and adding `MyModule` to the `imports`, the unit tests involving the `MatDialog` service opening `MyComponent` failed. After investigation, I found out that the instance injected by the component constructor and the instance injected by `TestBed.inject()` are now two separate ones.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed with the Angular core team that this is by design, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53929.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `MatDialogModule` has `MatDialog` in its `providers`: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/b8cf1308571b29622422cd56f7f76b7bbc5ba5b1/src/material/dialog/module.ts#L34\r\n\r\nIMHO it should be removed from the providers, as the service is `providedIn: 'root'`.\r\n\r\nThe `MatSnackBar` has the same issue, there might be more affected services in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/json-derulo/ng17-dialog-issue\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run `ng test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere is only one instance of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro pass\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere are multiple instances of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro fails\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.10\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.9\r\n...

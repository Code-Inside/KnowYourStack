The images provided to support this are named `image.1x.jpg`, `image.2x.jpg` and `image.3x.jpg`. Also there are multiple ways of building the application, causing the actual image to change based on the build variant, meaning the size of the image is not known.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to type:\r\n```html\r\n<img src=\"assets/image.jpg\" srcset=\"assets/image.1x.jpg 1x, assets/image.2x.jpg 2x, assets/image.3x.jpg 3x\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I want is to utilise the possibility of writing a custom `ImageLoader`:\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  provide: IMAGE_LOADER,\r\n  useValue: (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {\r\n    const srcComponents = config.src.split(\".\");\r\n\r\n    const density = config.density !== undefined ? config.density : \"1x\";\r\n    srcComponents.splice(-1, 0, density);\r\n\r\n    return srcComponents.join(\".\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen type the `img`-tag in the following way:\r\n```html\r\n<img fill ngSrc=\"assets/image.jpg\" ngSrcset=\"1x, 2x, 3x\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough, there is no property `density` on `ImageLoaderConfig` of course - the only size-related property available is `width`. `width` is however `NaN` when the image size is unknown, so it is not helpful here. Would it be possible to provide each of the density multipliers in a property `density` or in some other way to enable this?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA new property `density` on `ImageLoaderConfig` that contains the density multiplier for each call to the `ImageLoader`. At least I guess that it is more preferable than e.g. changing the type of `width` to `number | string | undefined`, then passing the density multiplier value there(?).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIt would be preferable if the density multipliers could be defined in `ngSrcset` instead of in the `ImageLoader` implementation itself, as this would allow for each image to support different sets of density multipliers.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have the following solution that works, but as mentioned, only for fixed density multipliers defined in the `ImageLoader` implementation itself (in this case 1x, 2x, 3x), and also feels hacky:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  provide: IMAGE_LOADER,\r\n  useFactory: (): ImageLoader => {\r\n    let densityMultiplier = 1;\r\n\r\n    return (config: ImageLoaderConfig): string => {\r\n      const srcComponents = config.src.split(\".\");\r\n      srcComponents.splice(-1, 0, `${pixelDensity}x`);\r\n\r\n      if (config.width === undefined) {\r\n        densityMultiplier = 1;\r\n      } else {\r\n        densityMultiplier++;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return srcComponents.join(\".\");\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54100","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide flexible way to generate `srcset` based on `ngSrcset` density multipliers when image size is unknown\" (#54100)"},{"Id":"2102453918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:57:50","Actor":"devversion","Number":"54098","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler-cli): enable dom binding type checking by default","State":"open","Body":"Currently Angular only validates that elements are existing as per our runtime DOM schema.\r\nAdditionally, we validate that non-directive input bindings are valid according to the schema.\r\n\r\nWe **never** validate whether the value of the expression is compatible with the targeted\r\nDOM property. This commit ensures this is happening by default with `strictTemplates` enabled.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this came up more prominently at this point:\r\n\r\n- Users will adopt signal inputs and might forget invoking the signal, while Angular will never complain that e.g. `[id]=\"bla\"` should actually be `[id]=\"bla()\"` due to unsatisfied type assignability.\r\n\r\nThere is old context on why we did not enable this by default in the past: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32171.\r\nIt's worth seeing if that is still the case, or at least working towards flipping this default.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54098","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler-cli): enable dom binding type checking by default\" (#54098)"},{"Id":"2102449429","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:54:55","Actor":"bgotink","Number":"54097","RawContent":null,"Title":"injector yields wrong result inside embedded view","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore, forms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nInside an embedded view with an associated injector the injector seems to return an unexpected result, even if the host flag is used.\r\n\r\nWe've got a nested form, and `formControlName` uses `@Host()` when injecting its container\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c3b00959659ca20d3f798820dfcb4dee250a32ac/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_name.ts#L129\r\n\r\nOur inner form is contained in an ng-template.

It supports regular expressions which would do fine but Angular CLI proxy configuration normalization messes up regular expressions. Normalization is done here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/load-proxy-config.ts\r\n\r\nThis step perhaps mistakenly treats regular expressions as globs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // TODO: Consider upstreaming glob support\r\n  for (const key of Object.keys(normalizedProxy)) {\r\n    if (isDynamicPattern(key)) {\r\n      const { output } = parseGlob(key);\r\n      normalizedProxy[`^${output}$`] = normalizedProxy[key];\r\n      delete normalizedProxy[key];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser we had:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"/internal-api\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"!/hui/**\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild something like this should be equivalent if the configuration would go to Vite without changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  \"/internal-api\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/(?!hui).*\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/$\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nng-packagr                      17.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26970","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI messes up proxy.conf.js regex proxy -settings passed to Vite when using esbuild\" (#26970)"},{"Id":"2102362827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:21:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26974","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis commit fixes an issue were negated globs in proxy config were not process correctly when using vite.\r\n\r\nCloses #26970","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26974","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite\" (#26974)"},{"Id":"2102202540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T14:54:37","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26972","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): handle regular expressions in proxy config when using Vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit enables proxies to have a RegExp as context when using Vite.

You can contact me at my mail: typicode at gmail :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n#### Introducing `husky init`\n\nAdding husky to a project is now easier than ever. Although the installation process was straightforward, it often required consulting the documentation.\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpm pkg set scripts.prepare=\"husky install\"\nnpm run prepare\nnpx husky add .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\n```\n\n##### v9\n\n```shell\nnpx husky init\n```\n\n#### Adding a New Hook\n\nAdding a hook is now as simple as creating a file. This can be accomplished using your favorite editor, a script or a basic `echo` command.\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpx husky add  .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\ngit add --chmod=+x .husky/pre-commit # On Windows\n```\n\n##### v9\n\n```shell\necho \"npm test\" > .husky/pre-commit\n```\n\n#### Further Size Reduction\n\n`v8` was already the most compact Git hooks manager at approximately `6kB`.\n\n`v9` takes this a step further, reducing the size to just `3kB`, likely making it the smallest devDependency in your toolkit.\n\n**To give you an idea of how small it is, the biggest file in the project is the MIT license 😄**\n\n#### More to Come\n\nAdditional features are in the pipeline for `v9`. Stay tuned :raised_hands:\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   **Enhanced security** with CI and npm `--provenance` for safer publishing.\n-   Added **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** support.

We still allow the user to select what tertiary color to pair with their primary, since the spec doesn't make the same sort of assumptions about the tertiary color.\r\n\r\nNote: because our demo targets styles at the .mat-primary, .mat-accent, .mat-error classes, it winds up overriding the default color combo that users would see out of the box for the mat-select (a primary form-field with a secondary selected option). This is one example where the M2 color=\"primary/accent/warn\" API doesn't quite align with how colors work in M3. We do not expect users to apply colors in this way, and we probably shouldn't do it in our demo either.

The problem is, the view does not properly update due to any events that happen. In my example I dragEnd, the data comes back from the server, and is not updated on the screen until I click or hover something. As soon as that happens the data shows properly. Happened in angular v15 and v17. changeDetectionRef.detectChanges() doesnt work to fix it either.\r\n\r\nI have other actions that call the exact same event (hitting the same endpoint) and when they return, the data shows properly. Perhaps it is an issue with the mat-table not playing nice with the drag end. I have seen many stack overflows alluding to this same issue. Im guessing this will just get closed because it 'doesnt exist' but there is definitely a bug in there experienced by many\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This required a few issues to be fixed:\r\n1. The badge was being sized with `width` and `height`. This is incorrect, because it prevents the badge from scaling with the text. I've resolved it while keeping the old behavior by introducing new tokens that target `min-width` and `min-height` while the old ones still target `width` and `height`.\r\n2. The badge was being positioned purely with `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`. This is problematic, because it anchors the badge to the specific point in the host, causing the content to grow inwards instead of outwards. I've fixed it by using the opposite dimensions to position the badge (e.g. `bottom: 100%` instead of `top: -20px`) and then using a negative margin to offset the badge from there. This approach also has the advantage of producing less CSS.\r\n3. The badge didn't have a padding which made the content look off if it's more than one character.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28460","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material-experimental/theming): implement M3 badge\" (#28460)"},{"Id":"2095759223","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T10:31:35","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"28465","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(m3): docs are not updated to showcase how to use M3 experimental theme","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the readme file steps or trying to get dev-app styles in another app doesn't work. \r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qbqvmb?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fglobal_styles.scss&title=Angular%20Starter\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/material-experimental ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28465","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(m3): docs are not updated to showcase how to use M3 experimental theme\" (#28465)"},{"Id":"2095709148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T10:04:53","Actor":"spike-rabbit","Number":"28464","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/listbox): cdkOptionTypeaheadLabel should allow undefined","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThe input `cdkOptionTypeaheadLabel` of `CdkOption` should allow `undefined` as an input type\n\n### Use Case\n\nI am using the `cdkListbox` internaly in a library.

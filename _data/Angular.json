Each of them is personally triggered on a click event.\r\n\r\n**My logic**\r\nThere is no reason why I should include them in the initial bundle, so I have to load them when the user wants them.\r\nI will create a Module, I won't import it anywhere and I will load the components using the `ComponentFactoryResolver` at the right time (click event).\r\n\r\nAll good, I use `<ng-template #containerRef></ng-template>` and I inject one component but surprise:\r\n`can't bind ngif since it's not a known property of div...`\r\nAfter some research I understand that I never imported the module anywhere and the component does not have access not even to the `CommonModule`(neither any module).\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n1. If I load the module dynamically before the loading of the component, will other components be included in the bundle as well? If yes, then I'm supposed to declare a _non-exported_ module for each lazy component? What's the catch? Doesn't seem to be the proper way.\r\n2.

When the application tries to load a chunk from the previous deployment A, it fails because naturally this chunk does not exist any longer.\r\n\r\nWe are of course using the Service Worker service `swUpdate`  to get notifications when a new version is available. However, it seems sometimes not all lazy loaded chunks are updated when there is a new SW version. \r\n\r\nWe are using `Ngrx/Store` to subscribe and listen to the swUpdate service observables: `available` and the new `unrecoverable` :  \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n // Listen for new versions of application available\r\n  newVersion$ = createEffect( () => this.swUpdate.available.pipe(\r\n      map( () => this.swUpdate.activateUpdate()),\r\n      switchMap( () => of(navigateAction([ '/', {outlets: { dialog: 'new-version' } } ])))\r\n  ));\r\n\r\n   // Listen for unrecoverable state from the service worker\r\n   swUnrecoverable$ = createEffect( () => this.swUpdate.unrecoverable.pipe(\r\n     map( event => {\r\n       console.log('Service worker unrecoverable event, reloading application');\r\n       window.location.reload();\r\n     })\r\n   ), { dispatch: false });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it seems like doesn't seem  `swUpdate.unrecoverable` subscription is ever triggered.\r\nMaybe it's a bug?

Everything is already populated in the router config (including custom data and access via a RouteGuard). When using static routes I would normally do something like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    this.items = this.router.config\r\n      .find((route: Route) => {\r\n        return route.path === this.routePath\r\n      })\r\n      ?.children\r\n      .filter((route: Route) => {\r\n        return route.data != null \r\n      })\r\n      .map((route: Route, index) => {\r\n        return {\r\n          path: \"/\" + this.routePath + \"/\" + route.path,\r\n          icon: route.data.icon,\r\n          label: route.data.label\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above simply creates an object array called items for the children of a specific route. I am not showing all the detail but just focusing on the children array because these are static routes. The object returned can be anything the developer needs. \r\n\r\nNow when using lazy loaded routes the children array is not available because the routing data is stored in lazy loaded modules that have not been loaded yet. Several people have tried to use the private _loadedConfig property on a route but it gets ugly and you end up with something like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    this.buttons = (this.router.config\r\n      .find((route: Route) => {\r\n        return route.path === this.routePath\r\n      }) as any)\r\n      ?._loadedConfig\r\n      ?.routes[0]\r\n      ?.children\r\n      .filter((route: Route) => {\r\n        return route.data != null \r\n      })\r\n      .map((route: Route, index: number) => {\r\n        return {\r\n          path: \"/\" + this.routePath + \"/\" + route.path,\r\n          icon: route.data.icon,\r\n          label: route.data.label,\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works its not ideal. The obvious issue is that the private _loadedConfig is subject to change without warning in the future because its not part of the public API and this object is not available until some point in the lifecycle that I have not been able to determine yet. \r\n\r\nNow the data that is eventually available in the _loadedConfig is exactly what developers are interested in (path, data, etc.) and it seems to be available even before the lazy modules are loaded. Given this would it be possible to present this information using the normal children array regardless if it’s a static route or a lazy loaded route? In most scenarios developers only care to have access to the route children and its less important that it’s from a static route vs. a lazy loaded route. A Boolean or enumeration could be added that would let the developer know the route static vs lazy if that is important. \r\n\r\nThis would mean any code designed to work with the router, config, and children would work with static or lazy loaded routes. The project could start with standard static routes and then later be reconfigured to use lazy routes and any code already in place that leverages the router config would continue to work.\r\n\r\nOne additional thought would be at webpack/compile time Angular would have access to all the routes regardless if they are static or lazy. Maybe some metadata can be derived from this and used to populate the routes children information at runtime.\r\n \r\nI know it’s a long shot, but I wanted to suggest the general idea.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40010","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider populating the router.config…children array the same for static and lazy loaded routes\" (#40010)"},{"Id":"758605782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-07T15:22:31","Actor":"constantant","Number":"40007","RawContent":null,"Title":"Input parameter order does matter","State":"open","Body":"After updating from 8th to the 10th version, the input parameter order does matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/core\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 8th version\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn case the Input decorator is used on a setter and a parallel input parameter is used inside the setter, this parallel parameter is not available during the setter execution.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-parameter-order-bug?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre>Error: cannot read property 'bla' of undefined<code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>10.2.3<code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

It is not present in the fresh project generated with Angular CLI 10.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile debugging a size regression in ng-bootstrap (https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/3904#issuecomment-740845567) when used in Angular 11 application I've spotted that a lot of dead code is retained because `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` is declared as a separate variable. Such pattern retains a linked component and consequently a lot of extra code used by this component. E.g. below code in the library will retain `MylibComponent` using Angular CLI 11, but will be removed as dead code using Angular CLI 10:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst TEST_VALUE_ACCESSOR = {\r\n  provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\r\n  useExisting: forwardRef(() => MylibComponent),\r\n  multi: true,\r\n};\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'lib-mylib',\r\n  template: ` <p>mylib works!</p> `,\r\n  styles: [],\r\n  providers: [TEST_VALUE_ACCESSOR],\r\n})\r\nexport class MylibComponent implements OnInit, ControlValueAccessor { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n- This only happens when code is present in the library. Component is eliminated as dead code if it is part of the application.\r\n- Inlining the variable will result in component being eliminated as dead code.\r\n- Library code processed by `ngcc` is identical, so I guess something in the application bundling has changed.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Clone the reproductions for Angular 10 and 11 (fresh project + fresh lib + minimal code reproducing the problem, each in a separate commit):\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone -b va10 git@github.com:devoto13/va-regression-repro.git va10\r\n   git clone -b va11 git@github.com:devoto13/va-regression-repro.git va11\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Build each repro:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   yarn ng build mylib --prod\r\n   NG_BUILD_MANGLE=false ./node_modules/.bin/ng build --prod\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Check `dist/va10/main.js` and `dist/va11/main.js` respectively. Observe that in v10 project `MylibComponent` symbol is not present in the bundle, but in v11 project this symbol is retained in the bundle together with the value accessor.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 11.0.3\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.3\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.3\r\nng-packagr                      11.0.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I ran into some issues, which were resolved using the solution provided by a member of the Angular CLI team here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39953. However, even though I can now build my app and its projects, when I try to run the tests, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n_ERROR [karma-server]: Server start failed on port 9876: TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'reporter:coverage' in karma-spec-reporter_\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why this is occurring, as it does not appear any of the Karma packages were changed, and my Karma configuration files have not changed either. The tests _will_ run if I disable code coverage reports, but I need those. I've also tried removing my codeCoverageExclusions, to no effect.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nI apologize that I'm unable to share the code behind this, but the scenario is:\r\n\r\n- Workspace containing 2 library projects and a main app\r\n- Problematic upgrade as described in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39953\r\n- Running _ng test_ or _ng test --project=(project)_ fails with the error mentioned above\r\n- Running _ng test_ with _--code-coverage=false_, or _codeCoverage=false_ in _angular.json_ works as expected, no error\r\n- I do not have this problem on a smaller, simpler app which just contains the main app in the workspace\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR [karma-server]: Server start failed on port 9876: TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'reporter:coverage' in karma-spec-reporter\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.3\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    8.2.3\r\n@angular/http                   7.2.16\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.3\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.3\r\nng-packagr                      11.0.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nA zip file containing my angular.json, and the karma.conf.js for my main app (but this has not changed), is attached.\r\n[KarmaNoLikey.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular/files/5661311/KarmaNoLikey.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19571","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"After Upgrading a Workspace Containing Multiple Projects to Angular 11, Karma Refuses to Run\" (#19571)"},{"Id":"759614381","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-08T17:39:33","Actor":"vahidvdn","Number":"19570","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use lint-staged for ng lint","State":"closed","Body":"There are some issues with `ng lint`.

Execute `ng new angular-test --routing=true & cd angular-test`\r\n2. Execute `ng add @angular/material`\r\n3. Import `MatListModule` into the `AppModule` and insert `<mat-nav-list></mat-nav-list>` into `app.component.html`\r\n4. Execute `ng generate module --route lazy --module app`\r\n5. Import `MatInputModule` into `LazyModule`\r\n6. Insert `<input matInput />` into `lazy.component.html`\r\n\r\nOr just clone my repository [csbenjamin/issue-with-tree-shake](https://github.com/csbenjamin/issue-with-tree-shake)\r\n\r\n7. Execute `ng build --prod`\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`@angular/forms` should be imported in the chunk lazy loaded.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`@angular/forms` is being imported in the main chunk.\r\n\r\nNote that if we remove the lazy route from `app.routing.module.ts`, then `@angular/forms` goes away from the main chunk, even using `mat-nav-list` in `app.component.html`. Also, if we keep the lazy route and remove the `MatListModule` dependency from the `AppModule`, then the `@angular/forms` goes to the lazy chunk, as it should be.\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be spliting `list.ts` and `selection-list.ts` into two different `NgModule`, so, if we are not using the `selection-list.ts` part, we just import the `NgModule` that contains `list.ts`, which does not depend on `@angular/forms`. \r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@angular/material               10.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19562","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatListModule): Should not import @angular/forms in main chunk if it's just using mat-nav-list\" (#19562)"},{"Id":"758769010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-07T19:24:52","Actor":"koenig-dominik","Number":"19563","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng lint with eslint Unknown option: '--files'","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\nCurrently, `ng update` silently installs packages. I'd like to have the option to see its progress. While perhaps in some environments, this command runs quickly enough not to warrant verbosity by default, for enterprise developers who are required to work in development environments that have virus scans slowing down installs, waiting several hours for `ng update` to install packages leaves developers unaware of what's going on.

This is a problem because some Angular Material consumers (in particular products internal to Google) have styles that depend upon the appropriate focus origin class. In my case, I have strong focus indicator styles that are only supposed to appear when the class `.cdk-keyboard-focused` is present. When opening a menu with a keyboard, I expect my strong focus indicator to render on the first menu item, but it does not.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a problem in both the old Material and new MDC menus.\r\n\r\n#### Problem & Solution\r\n\r\nThe problematic line is [here](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/menu/menu-trigger.ts#L335). Menu only tracks whether it was opened by a \"mouse\" or \"touch\" focus origin, and if it is neither of those, it defaults to \"program\". The easiest solution seems to be to update menu to also track \"keyboard\" focus origin. The `_handleKeydown` event handler will need to update the `_openedBy` focus origin to \"keyboard\". I'm open to other ideas as well.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://stackblitz.com/angular/xkpoabmbqpb?file=src/app/material-module.ts\r\n2. Open the menu with the \"Enter\" key.\r\n3.

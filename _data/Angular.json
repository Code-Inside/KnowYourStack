Key features in this state include:\r\n\r\n* History restoration via direct platform APIs rather than markers left on\r\n  `history.state`. This means more guaranteed correctness and less\r\n  internal code to compute traversal restorations.\r\n* Ability to observe navigations triggered outside the Router APIs.\r\n  Practically speaking, this means some navigations can be performed\r\n  through the platform rather than requiring `Router.navigate`. Note\r\n  that because the `NavigateEvent` is never intercepted at this point of\r\n  the implementation, regular anchor tags cannot be used because they\r\n  will still trigger a popstate navigation.\r\n\r\nThis implementation does _not_ intercept the `NavigateEvent` but future\r\niterations should. By omitting the interception, we are missing out on\r\nfeatures such as:\r\n\r\n* Platform-supported scroll and focus reset\r\n* Holding the navigate event open for the duration of the router\r\n  navigation, allowing for a visual loading indicator in the browser\r\n  (and ability to cancel navigation from the UI)\r\n* Support for intercepting navigations from regular anchor tags (e.g.\r\n  not `RouterLink`s) and converting those to SPA navigations.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): Build out integration with browser Navigation API\" (#64905)"},{"Id":"3588583420","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T00:44:33","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64904","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): allow FieldTree of recursive type","State":"open","Body":"Adjusts our typings to work better with recursive types and avoid infinite recursion in the type system.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64904","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): allow FieldTree of recursive type\" (#64904)"},{"Id":"3588582396","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T00:44:09","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64903","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): add better support for Object.keys and Symbol.iterator","State":"open","Body":"Improves support for using `Object.keys` (and related methods) and `Symbol.iterator` to work with a `FieldTree` of unknown shape.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64903","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): add better support for Object.keys and Symbol.iterator\" (#64903)"},{"Id":"3588581048","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T00:43:42","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64902","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): expose pathKeys as part of the API","State":"open","Body":"Currently we maintain the pathKeys internally, but do not expose them through the `FieldContext`, this PR updates the `FieldContext` to expose this property.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64902","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): expose pathKeys as part of the API\" (#64902)"},{"Id":"3588579758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T00:43:13","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64901","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): support dynamic object logic","State":"open","Body":"extends `applyEach` to work on objects as well, conditionally applying logic to each property of the object.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64901","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): support dynamic object logic\" (#64901)"},{"Id":"3587142407","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T00:07:49","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"64887","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `f3ab283` -> `2a91d0e` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `64fbfea` -> `75d22ea` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `64fbfea` -> `75d22ea` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - Every 2 hours, between 12:00 AM and 10:59 PM ( * 0-22/2 * * * ) in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The only way to apply the right context is to import the token in a hacky way by ignoring the export being prefixed with `ɵ`, marking it as private / not part of the public API.\n\nThe token was introduced in 2022 with this PR: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47103\n\nAs stated in this [PR comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47103#issuecomment-1240024205) it sounds like a future exposure has already been considered:\n> We can make it fully public later once we test everything end-to-end and collect the feedback.\n\nThe above change was merged already 3 years ago, so it should now be safe to expose the token.

Also, we do not want to make use of any `ServerRoutes` features, as anyway all routes should be SSR, and redirects or status codes will already be handled by the application logic.\n\nIn order to enforce all routes being SSR, I had to explicitly configure the app server config with:\n```typescript\nprovideServerRendering(\n  withRoutes([\n    {\n      path: '**',\n      renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n    }\n  ])\n)\n```\n## Issue 1:\nThere's no global switch to simply turn off SSG and I'm forced to add `withRoutes` with a catch-all route, even though I do not want to use any of the related features. \n\nHence it would be very useful to introduce a `withNoRoutes()` option, which also should disable the initial route evaluation/extraction while running a dev server - which is simply wasted computation time in our case.\n\nAs I do not want SSG, I already configured `\"outputMode\": \"server\"` in angular.json. I'm wondering why this setting isn't enough to turn off SSG completely, so that all pages will be SSR by default, not requiring `withRoutes()` configured.\n\n## Issue 2:\nOur routing setup includes a lot of lazy-load child routes. If one of the child routes has a matcher applied, then I get the below error:\n> Error: Error(s) occurred while extracting routes:\n> The route 'test/**' has a defined matcher but does not match any route in the server routing configuration. Please ensure this route is added to the server routing configuration.\n\nMy (simplified) routing setup is as follows:\n\nApp routes:\n```typescript\n{\n  path: 'test',\n  loadChildren: () => import('@my-app/test/feature').then(m => m.testFeatureRoutes)\n},\n```\nTest feature routes:\n```typescript\n  {\n    path: '',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n    component: TestComponent\n  },\n  {\n    matcher: () => null, <-- this guy here causes the error\n    component: TestComponent\n  },\n```\n\nAm I really forced now to add for all such routes a dedicated entry like `test/**` to ServerRoutes? In cases with very dynamic routing it seems to me also impossible or at least cumbersome to add all required sub-route catch-alls. Also, it's actually quite bad DX if one is bothered with having to solve errors for features he/she doesn't want to use anyway. \n\nSo, to me the both issues I described are tightly coupled: \nIf I would be able to turn off server routing completely, I wouldn't have to solve the problems with the catch-alls when using matchers.\n\nLooking forward to some answers explaining to me what can be done to get around the above mentioned obstacles.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n-\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nSee above\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.5\nNode: 22.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.3\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.5\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.5\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.8\n@angular/cli                    20.3.5\n@angular/google-maps            20.2.8\n@angular/ssr                    20.3.5\n@angular/youtube-player         20.2.8\n@schematics/angular             20.3.5\nng-packagr                      20.3.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.9.3\nzone.js                         0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31666","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Problems and errors with enforcing SSR using ServerRoutes\" (#31666)"},{"Id":"3586873201","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-04T15:31:28","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31689","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: clarify `outputMode` description in application schema","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the description for the  property in the application builder's schema.

Run `npm run build`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. Try changing url in url bar to /lt and back to /\n5. Everything should work\n\nScenario 2: running just EN build **works**:\nSteps:\n1. Run `npm run build:en`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. Works (EN page is displayed)\n\nScenario 3: running just LT build **does not work**:\nSteps:\n1. Run `npm run build:lt`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. **Does not work** (LT page is not displayed neither on /lt nor on root url)\n\nLooking at the compiled output of Scenario 3, I can find the culprit in `dist/locale-manifest-issue/server/server.mjs` `getEntryPointExportsForUrl` function:\n```\ngetEntryPointExportsForUrl(t) {\n  let { basePath: n } = this.manifest;\n  if (this.supportedLocales.length === 1) return this.getEntryPointExports(''); // <---- Delete this line\n  let r = cm(t, n);\n  return this.getEntryPointExports(r) ?? this.getEntryPointExports('');\n}\n```\nWhen there's a single locale, Angular always just assumes that the entrypoint is in server root. However, for LT locale, the entrypoint is actually in `lt` folder (`dist/locale-manifest-issue/server/lt/main.server.mjs`).\nDeleting the line marked with \"// <---- Delete this line\" comment fixes the issue. Meaning that visiting /lt now works as expected.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nNode: 22.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.4.2\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.9\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms, localize\n... platform-browser, platform-server, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.8\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.8\n@angular/build               20.3.8\n@angular/cli                 20.3.8\n@angular/ssr                 20.3.8\n@schematics/angular          20.3.8\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.9.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31675","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Launching a single locale with subpath does not work without hacks\" (#31675)"},{"Id":"3585557230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-04T14:37:20","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31684","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/ssr): improve locale handling in app-engine","State":"closed","Body":"Refactor app-engine to correctly handle single locale configurations and update manifest type definitions.

[plugin-transform-class-static-block](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-class-static-block), with the Webpack builder, the output is transformed in such a way it breaks existing code.\n\nAngular code compiled and bundled with `@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block@7.27.1`:\n```ts\nlet CodeEditorWidget = class CodeEditorWidget extends _base_common_lifecycle_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.Disposable {\n  static #_ = CodeEditorWidget_1 = this;\n  static #_2 = this.dropIntoEditorDecorationOptions = _common_model_textModel_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_27__.ModelDecorationOptions.register({\n    description: 'workbench-dnd-target',\n    className: 'dnd-target'\n  }); //#endregion\n  get isSimpleWidget() {\n    return this._configuration.isSimpleWidget;\n  }\n  get contextMenuId() {\n    return this._configuration.contextMenuId;\n  }\n  constructor(domElement, _options, codeEditorWidgetOptions, instantiationService, codeEditorService, commandService, contextKeyService, themeService, notificationService, accessibilityService, languageConfigurationService, languageFeaturesService) {\n    var _this;\n    super();\n    _this = this;\n\n   // Omitted for brevity\n};\n```\n\nAngular code compiled and bundled with `@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block@7.28.3`:\n```ts\nlet CodeEditorWidget = (class CodeEditorWidget extends _base_common_lifecycle_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.Disposable {                 \n  //#endregion\n  get isSimpleWidget() {\n    return this._configuration.isSimpleWidget;\n  }\n  get contextMenuId() {\n    return this._configuration.contextMenuId;\n  }\n  constructor(domElement, _options, codeEditorWidgetOptions, instantiationService, codeEditorService, commandService, contextKeyService, themeService, notificationService, accessibilityService, languageConfigurationService, languageFeaturesService) {\n    var _this = this;\n    super();\n\n    // Omitted for brevity\n\n  static #_ = _staticBlock = () => (CodeEditorWidget_1 = this, this.dropIntoEditorDecorationOptions = _common_model_textModel_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_27__.ModelDecorationOptions.register({\n    description: 'workbench-dnd-target',\n    className: 'dnd-target'\n  }), this);\n}, _staticBlock());\n```\n\nThe workaround, which you will also see explained in the attached reproducer, is to override the version of the Babel's plugin to 7.27.1.\n\nI don't understand why, and under which circumstance, that plugin is injected into the compilation process.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce can be found on the reproducer's repository:

Clone https://github.com/Wycza/angular-bug-getOrCreateAngularServerApp\n2. Install dependencies\n3. Run the server\n4. Open `localhost:4200`\n5. Change something which will produce error in template, e.g. in `index.component.html` file and save it\n6. Redo change so it is the valid template again\n7.

This leads to a situation where if those cached rows are later re-used the cells in the row don't match the columns.\n\n\nIt seems like this may be just a matter of clearing the row cache in `_forceRenderDataRows`. This assumes the row elements can't be re-used at all, but that seems to be the current behavior of `_forceRenderDataRows` to re-render everything. It looks like this could be achieved by calling `detach` on the `_RecycleViewRepeaterStrategy` instance in `_forceRenderDataRows`, but it's unclear the semantics of that method since it's not documented in `_ViewRepeater`. `CdkVirtualForOf` only calls it in `ngOnDestroy` and **`CdkTable` never calls it** (probably a separate bug where these row views get leaked when the table gets destroyed).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mssn6jgh?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-table-recycle-rows-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click `Set Short List` to reduce the number of rows to 15 (caching the 10 removed rows).\n2. Then click `Toggle Columns`. This forces a full re-render through `_forceRenderDataRows` (which doesn't populate the cache when removing).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll 15 rows re-render correctly\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen the 15 rows are re-rendered 5 have the old list of 3 columns since they were inserted from the cache and the remaining 10 are new rows and render correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2.4\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.4\n- Browser(s): 141.0.7390.126\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ChromeOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32253","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/table): CdkTable does not handle column updates correctly when using recycleRows\" (#32253)"},{"Id":"3584671427","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-04T04:33:30","Actor":"ajaygandecha","Number":"32251","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(chip): chip avatar images vertically stretched on safari","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOn Safari, the chips with an avatar image appear to be significantly vertically stretched. This issue is also apparent in the example tab on the [chip component page](https://material.angular.dev/components/chips/examples), as shown below:\n\n**Safari (v26.0.1 on MacOS 26 (Tahoe)):**\n<img width=\"402\" height=\"162\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86762b-8cd4-44dd-9da7-dea74907f2e0\" />\n\nOn other browsers including Chrome, the behavior works as expected:\n\n**Chrome:**\n<img width=\"392\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf59247-1777-4a48-8c8e-48c1e70b9799\" />\n\nThis appears to be an issue with Angular Material v19 and v18 as well, and this problem did not occur before the latest MacOS 26 (Tahoe) update.

Desktop and Android devices do not experience this issue. Similar symptoms have been reported by other projects ([[github.com](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/13848#:~:text=player%20configuration%20error%20153,on%20if%20you%27re%20using%20web)](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/13848#:~:text=player%20configuration%20error%20153,on%20if%20you%27re%20using%20web)).  \n\n**Steps to reproduce**  \n- Create a new Angular project and install `@angular/youtube-player`.  \n- Add `<youtube-player [videoId]=\"'VIDEO_ID'\"></youtube-player>` to a component template.  \n- Serve the application and access the page on an iOS device via Safari.  \n- Observe the video player.  \n\n**Expected behavior**  \nThe YouTube video should load and play correctly on iOS, just as it does on desktop and Android platforms.  \n\n**Actual behavior**  \nOn iOS devices, the video area displays “Video player configuration error 153” and does not play the video.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Angular version: 19.2.14  \n- @angular/youtube-player version: 19.2.18  \n- Ionic Framework (@ionic/angular) version: 8.6.0  \n- Browser: Safari on iOS (multiple versions)  \n\n**Additional context**  \nThe issue persists even when using the `youtube-nocookie.com` domain for the embed. Reproduced across multiple iOS devices and networks.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nN/A – this bug occurs only in a Capacitor mobile app on iOS and cannot be reproduced via an online StackBlitz because it depends on the native iOS player. To reproduce, follow these steps in a Capacitor project:  \n1. Create a new Angular project and install `@angular/youtube-player`.  \n2. Wrap the app into a Capacitor iOS project (e.g., using `ionic build` and `npx cap add ios`).  \n3. In an Angular component template, add `<youtube-player [videoId]=\"'VIDEO_ID'\"></youtube-player>` with a valid video ID.  \n4. Run the app on an iOS device using `ionic capacitor run ios`.  \n5. The embedded player fails to load and shows “Video player configuration error 153”.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe embedded YouTube player should load and play the specified video normally on iOS just like it does on desktop and Android. Users should not see a “Video player configuration error 153”.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iOS devices using an Ionic/Capacitor mobile application, the embedded YouTube video fails to play and instead shows an error message: \"Video player configuration error 153\".

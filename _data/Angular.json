This form is passed to a child component, which holds the input fields that modify the form’s state.\n\nWhen the button in the parent component is clicked, it triggers an asynchronous function that takes about a second to complete and then performs a reset on the form. While the form state itself correctly resets to pristine, the button in the parent component does not reflect this change and remains active. The button should become disabled after the reset since the form has returned to a pristine state.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Open the minimal reproduction of the bug.\n2. Modify one of the fields.\n3. Click the button.\n\n**Current Result:**\n\nThe form’s pristine state updates correctly, but the button in the parent component remains active, not reflecting the form’s pristine status.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nAfter the reset, the form should return to a pristine state, and the button in the parent component should become disabled.\n\n**Attached video**\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c57b69b-9c49-4d05-a859-93c2039fb12a\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/MADSENSE/AngularChangeDetection\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 20.9.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58612","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Async form reset is not reflecting pristine state change across angular components\" (#58612)"},{"Id":"2652803618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T18:39:27","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"58615","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove circleci as we no longer rely on it","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58615","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove circleci as we no longer rely on it\" (#58615)"},{"Id":"2651532263","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T18:05:03","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58607","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): control flow nodes with root at the end projected incorrectly","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes an edge case where a control flow node that has non-projectable nodes followed by an element node at the end would cause the entire control flow node to be projected.

I made this change because the todo-item component had an accessibility problem: it was a list item component that rendered an `li` into its own template. This meant that the component's host element was in between the `ul` and the `li`, which is invalid. The \"right\" way to do this would have been to use a component with an attribute selector, but this isn't something that fits into the _Essentials_ guide.\r\n* Reorder some of the concepts in the components topic\r\n* Combine \"Rendering dynamic templates\", \"Conditionals and loops\", and \"Handling user interaction\" into one topic, \"Dynamic interfaces with templates\". Having these as separate topics meant that there was more preamble/scaffolding around these relatively straightforward ideas. * Renamed the \"Sharing logic\" topic to \"Modular design with dependency injection\". Aside from this, I have made no meaningful changes to the DI topic; I may come back for another edit pass here, but this is not necessary for v19.\r\n* Add a link to the in-depth guide for each _Essentials_ topic.\r\n* Add a new introduction to the _Essentials_ overview that explains what this guide is and what it's trying to accomplish.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58603","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update essentials guide to include signals\" (#58603)"},{"Id":"2650609894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T23:13:12","Actor":"sharakouze","Number":"58602","RawContent":null,"Title":"resource signal : have a way to make value() to persists while loading like when we use reload()","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nMy typical use case is a resource loading data for a sortable table like this :\n\n```typescript\nreadonly tableResource = resource({\n    request: () => ({\n      sort: this.sort(),\n    }),\n    loader: async ({ request }) => {\n      const { sort } = request;\n      const response = await fetch(`http://localhost/api/test?sort=${sort}`);\n      return await response.json() as TableData[];\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOn the first execution when the data is loaded, _tableResource.value()_ contains my initial data.\n\nWhen the user sort the table, the _sort_ signal is changed therefore the tableResource reloads the data. \n\nWhile the loader function is running, _tableResource.value()_ is set to **undefined**, then when the data is loaded _tableResource.value()_ contains my new sorted data.\n\nI think this is the expected behavior but I have 2 problem with this :\n\n1/ If the fetch function is slow to return a value, the user will see all the table content disappearing (because the resource value changes to undefined) before it shows again.\nI think its best if the \"old\" data stays on the screen while it's loading (even if there is a loading indicator)\n\n2/ If I want to use a linkedSignal with the resource value, it will be called twice for only one reload\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think It would be nice if there was a way to force value to persists while it's loading (like when we call the reload() function)\nMaybe by using an option ?\nOr by making the behavior of reload() the default behavior since we can test _status_ to know the validity of _value_\n\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nTesting status() === ResourceStatus.Loading in a linkedSignal and use it in the template instead of using _tableResource.value_\n\n```typescript\ndata: WritableSignal<TableData[]> = linkedSignal({\n  source: () => ({\n    value: this.tableResource.value(),\n    status: this.tableResource.status(),\n  }),\n  computation: (source, previous) => {\n    if (previous && source.status === ResourceStatus.Loading) {\n      return previous.value;\n    }\n    return source.value ??

The esbuild configuration pre-configured the builder with the angular-devkit/build-angular:application option. If I run ng serve with this configuration the microfrontend works, but unfortunately I would need the browser-esbuild option and this is where the problem arises.\nSo by configuring angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild and changing the key from options.browser to options.main and then starting ng serve I get the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n\nChanging again from options.main to options.browser (not noticing that it warns you by saying: the browser property is not allowed.) and running ng serve again gives me:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nAnother test I performed is deleting the options.main/options.browser key and running ng serve again gives me the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nEven initializing the microfrontend with --type remote gives the same problem\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nreproducing this error is simple: \n- make a new app\n- install @angular-architects/native-federation library (my version is 18.2.2)\n- initialize the microfrontend with ng g @angular-architects/native-federation:init --type host\n- change in angular.json file architect.esbuild.builder: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\n- change from options.browser to options.main\n- ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 22.0.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use angular native federation with builder configuration: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\" (#28837)"},{"Id":"2644271472","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T09:21:24","Actor":"HazzMan2409","Number":"28821","RawContent":null,"Title":"What happened to javascript proxy configuration?","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIt looks like the proxy configuration being written in javascript is no longer supported.

solution for multiple configs and whitelabels.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI've considered copy pasting over and over again and making configs such as BRANDA-DEV, BRANDB-DEV,

option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating **@angular** to v19, I’ve encountered a ton SCSS compiler deprecation warnings across many of my Angular projects. This issue occurs because the “_sass_” dependency in **@angular/build/package.json** was updated from “_1.77.6_” to “_1.80.6_”. As a temporary workaround, I reverted this dependency to “_1.77.6_” in the project’s node_modules directory, although this is - quite obvious - not ideal.\n\nIdeally, we should remove deprecated SCSS code in our scss files and 3rd party dependencies (this is where it becomes a nightmare). However, as a temporary solution to silence these deprecation warnings and be relieved when running “_ng s_“, it would be helpful to pass a “**stylePreprocessorOptions**” (already exists) flag via “_angular.json_“ into the Sass compiler.\n\nPlease note that in Nuxt/Vite and Ember, disabling these deprecation warnings is already possible, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67812380/disable-dart-sass-warnings-produced-by-external-theme-file) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78997907/the-legacy-js-api-is-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-dart-sass-2-0-0).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdditional option in “angular.json\". (Should default to false.)\n\n```\n\"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n  \"silenceDeprecations\": true\n},\n```\n\nThis should result in passing the flag \"--quiet-deps\" to the sass compiler. How to silence this warnings internally can be learned here: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#silencing-deprecations-in-dependencies\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDowngrade sass dep to “1.77.6“.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add style preprocessor option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19\" (#28829)"},{"Id":"2645257155","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T07:19:46","Actor":"zrsio4","Number":"28826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 18 build --watch does not remove previous files when output hashing is used","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nI realize the title is almost word for word the same as #5846, but since that is 7 years old and for version 4, I figure creating a new case is ok.

E.g. `LOCALE_ID` ist frequently used and provided but has no such provider and must be done with the old syntax.\n\n```ts\nconst appConfig = [\n   ...,\n   // existing new Syntax\n   provideNativeDateAdapter(),\n\n   // existing old Syntax\n   {\n    provide: LOCALE_ID,\n    useValue:'de-AT',\n  },\n];\n```\n\n## The Benefit\n\nYou have auto-complete and type safety out of the Box, so in this case you don't have to check which Properties the provider expects.\n\n## Implementation Example\nThere would be no breaking Change introduced by this change.\n\n```ts\n// Type Safety included\nexport function provideMatPaginatorDefaultOptions(options: MatPaginatorDefaultOptions,): ValueProvider {\n  return {\n    provide: MAT_PAGINATOR_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n    useValue: options,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Potential Providers\n\n| Token | Provider |\n|--------|--------|\n| `LOCALE_ID` | `provideLocaleId` |\n| `MAT_DIALOG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | `provideMatDialogDefaultOptions` |\n| `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | `provideDatePipeDefaultOptions` |\n| `MAT_FORM_FIELD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | `provideMatFormFieldDefaultOptions` |\n| `MAT_PAGINATOR_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | `provideMatPaginatorDefaultOptions` |\n| `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` |  `provideMatDateLocale` | \n| `MAT_PROGRESS_BAR_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | `provideMatProgressBarDefaultOptions` |\n\n\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nIt would be easier to **provide** Angular Material specific **Tokens in a Type Safe way** without having to check in the Source Code which Options the Token expects.\n\n```ts\n  // Current Syntax\n  {\n    provide: MAT_PAGINATOR_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n    useValue: {\n      pageSizeOptions: [5, 10, 20, 50, 100],\n      showFirstLastButtons: true,\n    } as MatPaginatorDefaultOptions,\n  },\n\n  // Proposed Syntax\n  provideMatPaginatorDefaultsOptions({\n    pageSizeOptions: [5, 10, 20, 50, 100],\n    showFirstLastButtons: true,\n  }),\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29973","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(providers): provide Tokens in a Type Safe way\" (#29973)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-11-13T03:30:02.5142893Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1723}

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.7...v0.25.8)\n\n- Fix another TypeScript parsing edge case ([#&#8203;4248](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4248))\n\n  This fixes a regression with a change in the previous release that tries to more accurately parse TypeScript arrow functions inside the `?:` operator. The regression specifically involves parsing an arrow function containing a `#private` identifier inside the middle of a `?:` ternary operator inside a class body. This was fixed by propagating private identifier state into the parser clone used to speculatively parse the arrow function body. Here is an example of some affected code:\n\n  ```ts\n  class CachedDict {\n    #has = (a: string) => dict.has(a);\n    has = window\n      ? (word: string): boolean => this.#has(word)\n      : this.#has;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Fix a regression with the parsing of source phase imports\n\n  The change in the previous release to parse [source phase imports](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports) failed to properly handle the following cases:\n\n  ```ts\n  import source from 'bar'\n  import source from from 'bar'\n  import source type foo from 'bar'\n  ```\n\n  Parsing for these cases should now be fixed. The first case was incorrectly treated as a syntax error because esbuild was expecting the second case. And the last case was previously allowed but is now forbidden. TypeScript hasn't added this feature yet so it remains to be seen whether the last case will be allowed, but it's safer to disallow it for now. At least Babel doesn't allow the last case when parsing TypeScript, and Babel was involved with the source phase import specification.\n\n### [`v0.25.7`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0257)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.6...v0.25.7)\n\n- Parse and print JavaScript imports with an explicit phase ([#&#8203;4238](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4238))\n\n  This release adds basic syntax support for the `defer` and `source` import phases in JavaScript:\n\n  - `defer`\n\n    This is a [stage 3 proposal](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-defer-import-eval) for an upcoming JavaScript feature that will provide one way to eagerly load but lazily initialize imported modules. The imported module is automatically initialized on first use. Support for this syntax will also be part of the upcoming release of [TypeScript 5.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-9-beta/#support-for-import-defer). The syntax looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import defer * as foo from \"<specifier>\";\n    const bar = await import.defer(\"<specifier>\");\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature deliberately cannot be used with the syntax `import defer foo from \"<specifier>\"` or `import defer { foo } from \"<specifier>\"`.\n\n  - `source`\n\n    This is a [stage 3 proposal](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports) for an upcoming JavaScript feature that will provide another way to eagerly load but lazily initialize imported modules. The imported module is returned in an uninitialized state. Support for this syntax may or may not be a part of TypeScript 5.9 (see [this issue](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/61216) for details). The syntax looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import source foo from \"<specifier>\";\n    const bar = await import.source(\"<specifier>\");\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature deliberately cannot be used with the syntax `import defer * as foo from \"<specifier>\"` or `import defer { foo } from \"<specifier>\"`.\n\n  This change only adds support for this syntax. These imports cannot currently be bundled by esbuild. To use these new features with esbuild's bundler, the imported paths must be external to the bundle and the output format must be set to `esm`.\n\n- Support optionally emitting absolute paths instead of relative paths ([#&#8203;338](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/338), [#&#8203;2082](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2082), [#&#8203;3023](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3023))\n\n  This release introduces the `--abs-paths=` feature which takes a comma-separated list of situations where esbuild should use absolute paths instead of relative paths. There are currently three supported situations: `code` (comments and string literals), `log` (log message text and location info), and `metafile` (the JSON build metadata).\n\n  Using absolute paths instead of relative paths is not the default behavior because it means that the build results are no longer machine-independent (which means builds are no longer reproducible). Absolute paths can be useful when used with certain terminal emulators that allow you to click on absolute paths in the terminal text and/or when esbuild is being automatically invoked from several different directories within the same script.\n\n- Fix a TypeScript parsing edge case ([#&#8203;4241](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4241))\n\n  This release fixes an edge case with parsing an arrow function in TypeScript with a return type that's in the middle of a `?:` ternary operator. For example:\n\n  ```ts\n  x = a ? (b) : c => d;\n  y = a ? (b) : c => d : e;\n  ```\n\n  The `:` token in the value assigned to `x` pairs with the `?` token, so it's not the start of a return type annotation. However, the first `:` token in the value assigned to `y` is the start of a return type annotation because after parsing the arrow function body, it turns out there's another `:` token that can be used to pair with the `?` token. This case is notable as it's the first TypeScript edge case that esbuild has needed a backtracking parser to parse. It has been addressed by a quick hack (cloning the whole parser) as it's a rare edge case and esbuild doesn't otherwise need a backtracking parser. Hopefully this is sufficient and doesn't cause any issues.\n\n- Inline small constant strings when minifying\n\n  Previously esbuild's minifier didn't inline string constants because strings can be arbitrarily long, and this isn't necessarily a size win if the string is used more than once. Starting with this release, esbuild will now inline string constants when the length of the string is three code units or less. For example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  const foo = 'foo'\n  console.log({ [foo]: true })\n\n  // Old output (with --minify --bundle --format=esm)\n  var o=\"foo\";console.log({[o]:!0});\n\n  // New output (with --minify --bundle --format=esm)\n  console.log({foo:!0});\n  ```\n\n  Note that esbuild's constant inlining only happens in very restrictive scenarios to avoid issues with TDZ handling. This change doesn't change when esbuild's constant inlining happens. It only expands the scope of it to include certain string literals in addition to numeric and boolean literals.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine-npm (jasmine)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/releases/tag/v5.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/compare/v5.8.0...v5.9.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/main/release_notes/5.9.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine (jasmine-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v5.8.0...v5.9.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.9.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>markedjs/marked (marked)</summary>\n\n### [`v16.1.1`](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v16.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/compare/v16.1.0...v16.1.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n- fix stong and em tokens in angle brackets ([#&#8203;3731](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/3731)) ([ad8535c](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/ad8535c3ada13602929f54527d158a37fa16e4ee))\n\n### [`v16.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v16.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/compare/v16.0.0...v16.1.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n- add generic types for parser and renderer output ([#&#8203;3722](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/3722)) ([39a0ee3](https://redirect.github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/39a0ee326d8f549d2b14922ce1f3da3d4aeb8f4a))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>mermaid-js/mermaid (mermaid)</summary>\n\n### [`v11.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/releases/tag/mermaid%4011.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/compare/mermaid@11.8.1...mermaid@11.9.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- [#&#8203;6453](https://redirect.github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/pull/6453) [`5acbd7e`](https://redirect.github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/commit/5acbd7e762469d9d89a9c77faf6617ee13367f3a) Thanks [@&#8203;sidharthv96](https://redirect.github.com/sidharthv96)!

Using `InjectionToken`'s. I have found in our org (which maintains 7ish angular applications) junior Angular engineers expect a service to be a class so this one tends to confuse them. Not a big deal to workaround though\n```typescript\nconst CART_SERVICE = new InjectionToken('CART_SERVICE', {\n\tfactory: () => new CartService(),\n});\n```\n\n2. Defining a `CartManager` seperately from the `CartService` (my current favorite workaround). This still requires some social enforcement but it's better than the abstract class.\n\n```typescript\ninterface CartManager {\n\tevents: Observable<CartEvent>;\n\tadd(productId: string): Observable<AddProductResponse>;\n\tremove(productId: string): Observable<RemoveProductResponse>;\n}\n\ninterface CartManagerConstructor {\n\tnew (): CartManager;\n\tprototype: CartManager;\n}\n\nconst CartManager: CartManagerConstructor = class {\n\t#http = inject(HttpClient);\n\n\t#events = new Subject<CartEvent>();\n\tevents = this.#events.asObservable();\n\n\tadd(productId: string): Observable<AddProductResponse> {\n\t\t// Implementation\n\t}\n\n\tremove(productId: string): Observable<RemoveProductResponse> {\n\t\t// Implementation\n\t}\n};\n\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\n// This service purely exists to apply the @Injectable decorator.\nexport class CartService extends CartManager {\n\t// Do NOT add any logic here. Add it in the CartManager instead.\n}\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62712","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: Support defining injectables on Interface Collapse Pattern\" (#62712)"},{"Id":"3244549975","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T23:15:53","Actor":"ShacharHarshuv","Number":"62714","RawContent":null,"Title":"When \"Angular DevTools\" extension is enabled on chrome, and trying to log in to ChatGPT - the browser freezes","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a bug report or a feature request?\n\n- [x] Bug Report\n- [ ] Feature Request\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue [Bug Report only]\n\n1.

While that fixes this particular problem, because **index.csr.html** is hardcoded into the server code, it crashes the server if any of the routes are `Client` rendered.\n\nRenaming the output files to something like `server.html` and `client.html` or ensuring that the `index` option also updates the file references used internally by the server, would resolve the issue.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere's a public repo with a minimal Angular v20 setup: https://github.com/srcn/angular20ssr\n\nIt's deployed here: [https://angular20ssr.vercel.app/](https://angular20ssr.vercel.app/)\n\nIf you check the source code of the homepage, you will see it's `Client` rendered even though all server routes are set to `Server` rendering mode.\n\nIf you visit the second route [https://angular20ssr.vercel.app/second-route](https://angular20ssr.vercel.app/second-route) and see the source code, you will see it's correctly rendered using the server.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.1.1\nNode: 22.15.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.4.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.1.1\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-server, router, ssr\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.1\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.1\n@schematics/angular          20.1.1\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30736","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"index.csr.html causes Vercel to bypass Angular SSR entrypoint for / route\" (#30736)"},{"Id":"3247988111","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-21T10:05:57","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30748","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, in the `--minimal` template, there is no `.editorconfig` file, yet the same Prettier configuration is still present in `package.json`.\n\nI’ve noticed that in `--minimal` projects, this Prettier override seems to cause TypeScript files to format using double quotes, even when my Prettier settings specify `singleQuote: true`. As soon as I remove the overrides block, Prettier respects the single quote rule again in `.ts` files.\n\nThis seems unintended, as the override is only targeting `*.html` files.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4edd5972-1b7b-43cd-998c-5389e0cf2544)\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nTo reproduce the issue, install the latest version of Angular CLI and create a project using:\n\n```bash\nng new <project-name> --minimal\n```\n\nThen open any `.ts` file and try saving it. You’ll observe that all single quotes are replaced with double quotes, as demonstrated in the GIF above.\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.1.1\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.4.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular:\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.1 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.1 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.1 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          20.1.1 (cli-only)\n\n\nesbenp.prettier-vscode version 11.0.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI tested with an older version of Angular CLI, specifically v20.0.3 (before commit [2316fe2](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/2316fe2)), and the issue did not occur there.\n\nAs a workaround, I added an additional overrides entry in `package.json` to explicitly force Prettier to use single quotes for `.ts` files:\n```json\n\"prettier\": {\n    \"overrides\": [\n      {\n        \"files\": \"*.html\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"parser\": \"angular\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"files\": \"*.ts\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"singleQuote\": true\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fb00327-1580-4618-89d3-0fd7c858860c)\n\nThis seems to restore the expected formatting behavior for TypeScript files, though I’m not certain whether this workaround could introduce unintended side effects.

I've patched my node modules to see what that would look like and it works like a charm: `@cypress/code-coverage` is generating the reports, the `node_modules` are excluded, and I'm able to use the same builder for E2E and prod builds.\n\nIn the next section I've collected some of the hoops I had to jump through to get close (but fail to attain) this level of integration. By the end of the read, I hope you'll agree with me that a built-in solution (considering it's already coded!) would be a step-up in terms of developer experience.\n\nIn the meantime, for reference, here's the quick-n-dirty patch.\n```\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/schema.json b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/schema.json\nindex 3ee8699..0b893a0 100755\n--- a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/schema.json\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/schema.json\n@@ -47,6 +47,10 @@\n       \"type\": \"string\",\n       \"description\": \"Customize the base path for the URLs of resources in 'index.html' and component stylesheets.

That might sound like I haven't done any due diligence, when in fact I have.\n\n- `@angular-builder/custom-esbuild` with `esbuild-plugin-istanbul` doesn't work because the `onLoad` callback of an esbuild plugin (such as the one defined by the istanbul plugin) is called only as long as no previous plugin handled the resource that's being loaded, and the `angular-compiler` handles them all.\n\n  - A possible solution could be a custom plugin that overrides the default namespace of each resource we may want to instrument (with `onResolve`), which would effectively sidestep the Angular compiler BUT force the plugin author to reimplement the compilation. Very high effort.\n\n- A Vite plugin (rather than an esbuild one) could work, but the Angular builder is not based on Vite. `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` is, but it doesn't have a builder, only an executor for `@nx`, which is another can of worms. In short, the migration path isn't straightforward at all, and let's remember: this is all to add instrumentation!\n\n- I've considered trying Angular Rspack, but [it's still experimental](https://nx.dev/technologies/angular/angular-rspack/introduction#rspack). I want my E2E tests to be as close to my production environment as they can get, and using two different builders (one for prod and one for e2e) is not an option.\n\n- Finally, of course, the `@angular/build` package doesn't do instrumentation. Not through the builder schema anyway.\n\nApart from my lack of Webpack knowledge (see footnote), it appears to me that the setup I found is still not ideal. Some reasons:\n\n1. Angular moved away from Webpack. The happy path--aka, the officially supported path--is esbuild, not Webpack.\n2. Webpack is slower than esbuild in most cases. Not a big deal but I'm sure there are some peeps who'd be very impacted by that.\n3. No third-party esbuild-based builder that makes use of the official devkit/extends the `@angular/build` builder will ever be able to offer a different experience. Any plugin passed to the builder will always be appended to the end of the list of plugins, *after* the angular compiler. Ergo, no `onLoad` callbacks.\n\n[1] I say semi-working 'cause I don't know Webpack enough--but who does 😆--and didn't manage to add the instrumentation to the un-chunked code, which regrettably leads to instrumented `node_modules`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30742","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose internal \"instrumentForCoverage\" option\"

The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nIssue with requested main.js filename not including the hash when deployed to firebase app hosting\n\n### Description\n\nI've got an angular/ssr 20.1.1 site where all but one test route is csr (the ssr route is not used in this bug repro).  I seem to be having some issues with filename hashing when deploying to firebase app hosting\n\n1) ng build --configuration=production\n2) npm run serve:ssr (to test)\n3) firebase deploy --only apphosting:mybackend2\n\nwhen i do step 2 and visit my local site csr page i see main-UKL5WJPJ.js being downloaded successfully\nAnd I see this file in the filesystem:   dist\\diveplan\\browser\\main-UKL5WJPJ.js. \n\nWhen I deploy to firebase app hosting and view my site, I see the network trace refer to main.js without a hash in the filename!  This is causing the site to fail to render.  There is no dist\\diveplan\\browser\\main.js\n\npackages used:\n\n```\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^20.1.1\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^20.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^20.1.1\",\n

However, this creates problems regarding WCAG compliance and accessibility.\n\nAccording to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), **tree structures can be used for page navigation** as demonstrated in the [Treeview Navigation Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/). The guidelines specify that:\n\n1. `aria-current=\"page\"` should be used (instead of `aria-selected`) to indicate the current page\n2. Navigation should be implemented using `<a>` tags\n\nAngular Material however enforces this default role structure:\nmat-tree → role=\"tree\"\nmat-nested-tree-node → role=\"treeitem\"\n\n...there is an issue when trying to use semantically correct links (`<a>` tags) within `<mat-nested-tree-node>` – for example, with aria-current=\"page\".\n\nWhen we intend to use the `<mat-tree>` component as a recursive tree-based site navigation, the question becomes how to correctly integrate and semantically mark up an `<a>` tag. Ideally, the `<a>` tag itself should receive the role=\"treeitem\" and the aria-current=\"page\" attribute when it represents the current page.\n\nCurrently, it's unclear to us how the `<mat-tree>` component can be extended to meet this specific requirement for web links.\n\nRemoving the `<a>` tag and replacing it with manual navigation (this.router.navigate()) is not an option due to synchronization problems etc.\n\nThe following code snippet shows our current approach:\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"treeDataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\" class=\"nested-tree\">\n  <mat-nested-tree-node [attr.aria-current]=\"linkActive.isActive ? 'page' : null\"\n    *matTreeNodeDef=\"let item; when: hasChild\">\n    <div\n      class=\"mat-tree-node\"\n      matTreeNodeToggle\n      routerLinkActive=\"menu-nav--highlighted\"\n      [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\"\n      #linkActive=\"routerLinkActive\">\n        <button mat-mini-fab color=\"light\" [attr.aria-label]=\"'toggle ' + item.title\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n          <mat-icon [svgIcon]=\"treeControl.isExpanded(item) ? 'arrow-down-20' : 'arrow-right-20'\">\n          </mat-icon>\n        </button>\n      <a\n        class=\"menu-nav__link tree-node-link\"\n        [routerLink]=\"item.route\"\n        tabindex=\"-1\"\n        [attr.aria-label]=\"item.title\"\n        [attr.title]=\"item.title\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        (click)=\"onNodeToggle($event, item)\">\n        {{ item.title }}\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div [ngClass]=\"{ hidden: !treeControl.isExpanded(item) }\" role=\"group\">\n      <ng-container matTreeNodeOutlet></ng-container>\n    </div>\n  </mat-nested-tree-node>\n</mat-tree>\n```\nI would appreciate an official way or best practice to semantically implement accessible links with aria-current inside the **mat-tree** pattern.\n\nThank you in advance for any feedback or proposed solutions!\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nA way to configure **mat-tree** so that:\n\n1.

Neither should be available for reordering.\n\n\nHere's the draggable list:\n\n<img width=\"832\" height=\"610\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763ab754-f54f-4666-9ba3-9d41c971c508\" />\n\n\nI tried to hide these columns with an `@if` within `@for` loop:\n\n```\n<div cdkDropList [cdkDropListSortPredicate]=\"sortPredicate\" (cdkDropListDropped)=\"drop($event)\">\n  @for (column of columnsForEdit; track column.id) {\n    @if (!column.isFunctional) {\n      <div\n        cdkDrag\n        cdkDragPreviewContainer=\"parent\"\n        cdkDragBoundary=\".draggable-list\"\n        cdkDragLockAxis=\"y\"\n        [cdkDragDisabled]=\"!column.isMovable\"\n      >\n        <mat-checkbox\n          [checked]=\"column.isVisible\"\n          [disabled]=\"!column.isToggleable\"\n          (change)=\"onColumnVisibilityChange($event, column)\"\n        >  \n          <mat-icon [class.disabled]=\"!column.isMovable\">drag_indicator</mat-icon>\n          {{ column.columnEditorTranslationKey && (column.columnEditorTranslationKey | translate) }}\n        </mat-checkbox>\n      </div>\n    }\n  }\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever **the order is messed up after dropping an item in the new position**.\nI also tried to hide elements with `display: none` instead but got the same result.\n\n[The solution](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20633#issuecomment-872964310) from the comments of the issue mentioned above helped, but it's not documented and looks more like a hack than something to rely upon.\n\nI would expect to have a documented way of overcoming this or a fix.\n\nP.

It hides the first array item via `@if`.\n2.

The mat-stepper when used on android device or an windows then announces labels correctly. But when it is opened on iOS device, then screen reader read every field in tab panel with suffix 'tab'. Like in provided example for tabpanel in first step, screen reader reads like 'first step, last step tab' then 'next tab'. It doesn't announce 'next button' instead it announce all the elements in tabpanel with suffix tab.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/2webe4ha?file=package.json\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open mat-stepper example on iOS device\n2. listen to screen reader announcing the page contents\n3. for first step it should announce next button as 'button next' but it announces as 'next tab'\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFields should be properly announced when they are inside mat-stepper panel like for button it should read as 'next button' .\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFields inside mat-stepper panel are getting announced with 'tab' suffix like for next button, it is reading as 'next tab'.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: v20.1.0\n- CDK/Material: v20.1.0\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System

migration since v18","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nIn our project we started using Material 3 theming since Angular 18.\nWe used for that the following mixins mat.define-theme, mat.define-light-theme, or mat.define-dark-theme.\nIn usage like:\n\n```scss\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\n$theme: mat.define-theme((\n  color: (\n    theme-type: dark,\n    primary: mat.$violet-palette,\n  ),\n  typography: (\n    brand-family: 'Comic Sans',\n    bold-weight: 900\n  ),\n  density: (\n    scale: -1\n  )\n));\n```\n\nBut since Angular 19 and now Angular 20, we have in the documentation [Here](https://material.angular.dev/guide/theming) a comment indicating to still have a look to v18 documentation.\n\n`If your application depends on a version before v19, or if your application's theme is applied using a theme config created with mat.define-theme, mat.define-light-theme, or mat.define-dark-theme, then you can refer to the theming guides at [v18.material.angular.dev/guides](https://v18.material.angular.dev/guides).`\n\nRegarding that, several questions/clarifications will help a lot:\n- the \"old way\" used since V18 is going to be deprecated ?\n- we follow all release notes since v18, but didn't see anything explaining how to migrate to the new functions ?\n- Is there a schematic available for that migration ?\n\nThanks for your help\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/guide/theming","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue

There are various reasons for this and in in vast majority of cases the problems are **unrelated** to hydration. However, previously this was not \"visible\" in the app, but with hydration the use of `ApplicationRef.isStable` increased and it becomes more important to get to the \"stable\" state.\r\n\r\nAs a first step to improve the DX, we should add a warning when the app didn't get to the \"stable\" state after some time (N seconds, N=10?). For this warning it'd be also important to have an error guide page to explain this problem in more details and provide some hints on how to resolve that. We could also use this error guide page to collect more information about use-cases over time.\r\n\r\nRelevant code: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/hydration/api.ts#L162-L183.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50285","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hydration: add a warning when ApplicationRef.isStable doesn't emit `true` after some time\" (#50285)"},{"Id":"1708762151","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-13T23:06:01","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"50284","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency jasmine-core to v5","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [jasmine-core](https://jasmine.github.io) ([source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine)) | dependencies | major | [`^4.0.0` -> `^5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine-core/4.6.0/5.0.0) |\n| [jasmine-core](https://jasmine.github.io) ([source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine)) | devDependencies | major | [`~4.6.0` -> `~5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine-core/4.6.0/5.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.0.0): 5.0.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Is that enough to call this a breaking change?\r\n\r\nI'm not certain about this, but I think there might be a similar issue with the `Host` flag and embedded view injectors. I don't see any special handling of the `Host` flag in the `lookupTokenUsingEmbeddedInjector` function, so I assume that if you created a hierarchy like `node -> embeddedView -> node -> embeddedView -> node` and used `@Host` on that last node, it would reach all the way up to the top node (past its \"host\") to find the token it was looking for. I ran out of time to look into this today, but I can take a look next week.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50270","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): fix `Self` flag inside embedded views with custom injectors\" (#50270)"},{"Id":"1707845388","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T15:59:30","Actor":"IanSkylegs","Number":"50268","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow on the fly DatePipe default settings change.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\nI know we can change the defaults by setting the DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS token.

The bugs were due to lack of test coverage for nested selectors with more than one compound selector where they all start with the same combinator. Here's what some problematic cases look like before and after these fixes:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      > &a,\n      > &b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    .bar {\n      > &a,\n      + &b {\n        color: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo :is(> .fooa, > .foob) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar :is(> .bara, + .barb) {\n      color: green;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo > :is(a.foo, b.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar > a.bar,\n    .bar + b.bar {\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix bug with TypeScript parsing of instantiation expressions followed by `=` ([#&#8203;3111](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3111))\n\n    This release fixes esbuild's TypeScript-to-JavaScript conversion code in the case where a potential instantiation expression is followed immediately by a `=` token (such that the trailing `>` becomes a `>=` token). Previously esbuild considered that to still be an instantiation expression, but the official TypeScript compiler considered it to be a `>=` operator instead. This release changes esbuild's interpretation to match TypeScript. This edge case currently [appears to be problematic](https://sucrase.io/#transforms=typescript\\&compareWithTypeScript=true\\&code=x%3Cy%3E%3Da%3Cb%3Cc%3E%3E\\(\\)) for other TypeScript-to-JavaScript converters as well:\n\n    | Original code | TypeScript | esbuild 0.17.18 | esbuild 0.17.19 | Sucrase | Babel |\n    |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n    | `x<y>=a<b<c>>()` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a();` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a()` | Invalid left-hand side in assignment expression |\n\n-   Avoid removing unrecognized directives from the directive prologue when minifying ([#&#8203;3115](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3115))\n\n    The [directive prologue](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-directive-prologues-and-the-use-strict-directive) in JavaScript is a sequence of top-level string expressions that come before your code. The only directives that JavaScript engines currently recognize are `use strict` and sometimes `use asm`. However, the people behind React have made up their own directive for their own custom dialect of JavaScript. Previously esbuild only preserved the `use strict` directive when minifying, although you could still write React JavaScript with esbuild using something like `--banner:js=\"'your directive here';\"`. With this release, you can now put arbitrary directives in the entry point and esbuild will preserve them in its minified output:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    'use wtf'; console.log(123)\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(123);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    \"use wtf\";console.log(123);\n    ```\n\n    Note that this means esbuild will no longer remove certain stray top-level strings when minifying. This behavior is an intentional change because these stray top-level strings are actually part of the directive prologue, and could potentially have semantics assigned to them (as was the case with React).\n\n-   Improved minification of binary shift operators\n\n    With this release, esbuild's minifier will now evaluate the `<<` and `>>>` operators if the resulting code would be shorter:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(10 << 10, 10 << 20, -123 >>> 5, -123 >>> 10);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10<<10,10<<20,-123>>>5,-123>>>10);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10240,10<<20,-123>>>5,4194303);\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Caching is enabled by default within\r\nthe CLI and can be controlled via the `ng cache` command. This is the first use of persistent caching for the\r\nesbuild-based builder. If the TypeScript `incremental` option is manually set to `false`, the build system will\r\nnot alter the value. This can be used to disable the behavior, if preferred, by setting the option to `false` in\r\nthe application's configured `tsconfig` file.\r\nNOTE: The build information only contains information regarding the TypeScript compilation itself and does not\r\ncontain information about the Angular AOT compilation. TypeScript does not have knowledge of the AOT compiler\r\nand it therefore cannot include that information in its build information file.

Additionally, in other places, this same class appears to remove the content attribute, which is how the icons are displayed. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"412\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1176341/2f9a4838-5cfe-4a5a-889d-a7773642b028\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce. \r\n\r\nCreate a mat-icon using font awesome, make it a button for example \r\n\r\n    <mat-chip-grid #chipGrid aria-label=\"Fruit selection\">\r\n      <mat-chip-row *ngFor=\"let fruit of fruits\" (removed)=\"remove(fruit)\">\r\n        {{fruit}}\r\n        <button matChipRemove [attr.aria-label]=\"'remove ' + fruit\">\r\n          <mat-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"fa-times\"></mat-icon>\r\n        </button>\r\n      </mat-chip-row>\r\n    </mat-chip-grid>\r\n    \r\n    See that the class mat-focus-indicator nukes the icon by setting ::before to display: none;\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nmat-focus-indicator should not set display: none on ::before as it impacts all other ::before psuedoselectors\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nNot overriding icons which use the ::before psuedoselector\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 16 (and 15)\r\n- Browser(s): Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27067","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mat Focus Indicator breaks mat-icon with font awesome\" (#27067)"},{"Id":"1702517145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-09T18:14:40","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27066","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `4251a57` -> `9f37c10` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `64aaae0` -> `cdbc302` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `4ca6128` -> `c06ec94` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

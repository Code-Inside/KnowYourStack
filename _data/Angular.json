I determined that it was because by parent component was standalone and importing the child components directly. I did eventually get this working by using the `overrideComponent` method, however the docs made it seem like that wasn't needed in this case.\r\n\r\nThere is [a later section](https://angular.dev/guide/testing/components-scenarios#override-component-providers) all about the needed method, so I think that the nested component tests section should mention that this might be necessary and link to the later section for the full details. \r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/testing/components-scenarios#nested-component-tests\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nI was looking for the preferred way to do shallowing testing of standalone components.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nI implemented stub components like the angular.dev page example and used them in `configureTestingModule` rather than `overrideComponent`. This led to the tests breaking due to missing providers needed in the child components.

We serve several CSS \"theme\" files that are swappable, and need to be loaded dynamically by our theme utility (meaning: served externally from the Angular application bundle). We are creating a migration path for upgrading to Angular 17 and came across this issue.  We had this working in Angular 16 and below without issues.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI've setup a repo that demos the problem [here](https://github.com/EdwardCoyle/angular-ids-wc-example).

After debugging, it seems mouse clicking it will trigger \"focus\" event, hence `select.open()` is called twice eventually, causing the dropdown menu to fluctuate.\r\n\r\nI have created examples for v15 and v17 as comparison on StackBlitz.\r\n[Angular v15](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-7tmynx?file=src%2Fselect-open-on-focus.directive.ts) and [Angular v17](https://stackblitz.com/edit/pvsz9u-zksugu?file=src%2Fapp%2Fmat-select-focus.directive.ts)\r\n\r\nHas Angular changed how the \"click\" event is handled?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/pvsz9u-zksugu?file=src%2Fapp%2Fmat-select-focus.directive.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click `<input>` on the page\r\n2. click `<mat-select>` on the page\r\n3. if fluctuation is not seen, repeat step 1 and 2\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe dropdown menu doesn't fluctuate.

This is accomplished by adding an additional namesapce to the token map per color variant. For example, if the mat-icon tokens live in the token map under `(mat, icon): (token-values...)`, and we want to support a primary color variant, we will add a new namespace `(mat, icon, primary): (token-value-overrides...)`.\r\n\r\nWhen applying a color or theme mixin for an M3 theme, users can specify the desired variant as an extra parameter to the mixin: `@include mat.icon-theme($theme, $color-variant: primary)`. The mixin will then merge any overrides from the variant namespace into the default values from the standard namespace to determine the final value for each CSS variable. Note that the user must provide this a keyword argument, not a positional argument. This makes the API easier to maintain should we need to add other options later.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the necessary infrastructure for color variants, this PR also builds out the color variant supprot for mat-icon to prove out the infrstructure and serve as an example.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28279","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): Add support for color variants\" (#28279)"},{"Id":"2039218070","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:40:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28273","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides","State":"closed","Body":"**Note:** this is a resubmit of #28249.\r\n\r\nSwitches the custom density implementation of the form field to be based on tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28273","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides\" (#28273)"},{"Id":"2040570958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:37:20","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28278","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28278","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.\" (#28278)"},{"Id":"2040560630","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:26:40","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28277","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28277","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.4 release\" (#28277)"},{"Id":"2040544755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:23:42","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28276","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28276","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.4\" with changelog.\" (#28276)"},{"Id":"2040260199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T18:31:41","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28275","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): update inactive input width on value change","State":"open","Body":"* fixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28206","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28275","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): update inactive input width on value change\" (#28275)"},{"Id":"2040255258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T18:27:58","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"28274","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): failing color contrast text to bg color ratio","State":"open","Body":"\r\nRemoves :hover and .mat-focused opacity changes to .form-field-focus-overlay \r\nwhich was causing a low color contrast ratio between the text and form-field input\r\nbackground fill color.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28274","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/form-field): failing color contrast text to bg color ratio\" (#28274)"},{"Id":"2038461172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T17:49:53","Actor":"incy-tron","Number":"28270","RawContent":null,"Title":"SnackBar no longer supports panelClass","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAngular 14.\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/26928#issuecomment-1533422940\r\nResponding to closing of the referenced issue, which indicates \"... we generally don't support style overrides like this\".

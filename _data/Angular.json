Some (but not all) of the issues here are:\r\n\r\n* Advice for creating test spies that do not implement the whole interface\r\n```\r\nconst twainService = jasmine.createSpyObj('TwainService', ['getQuote']);\r\ngetQuoteSpy = twainService.getQuote.and.returnValue(of(testQuote));\r\n...\r\nproviders: [{provide: TwainService, useValue: twainService}]\r\n```\r\nThis is problematic on the whole. In this particular scenario, we should be using `HttpClientTestingModule` and _not_ providing a service fake.\r\n* Component marble tests section - RxJS is a separate library. Documentation on testing RxJS specifics should not live in Angular docs. \r\n* Component inside a test host section - we now have [`setInput`](https://angular.io/api/core/ComponentRef#setInput), making host components less necessary\r\n* Sections related to router - These sections should use `RouterTestingModule`. `ActivatedRoute` stubs are brittle and _do_ rely on Router navigations to be created appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this page has many test practices that our team would not recommend. It should be reviewed on the whole to ensure we are not leading developers down a path we wouldn't take ourselves.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios#component-testing-scenarios\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48510","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Component testing scenarios docs page outdated and advises harmful test practices\" (#48510)"},{"Id":"1498880442","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-15T18:12:03","Actor":"atscott","Number":"48508","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): Router.createUrlTree should work with any ActivatedRoute","State":"open","Body":"This change makes the `createUrlTreeFromSnapshot` added in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45877 the\r\ndefault and only behavior in the Router.

Previously when bundling with the `file` loader, there was no reference in the metafile from the JavaScript file containing the path string to the copied file. With this release, there will now be a reference in the metafile in the `imports` array with the kind `file-loader`:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       ...\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\": {\n           ...\n         },\n         \"out/entry.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"file-loader\"\n    +        }\n           ],\n           ...\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix byte counts in metafile regarding references to other output files ([#&#8203;2071](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2071))\n\n    Previously files that contained references to other output files had slightly incorrect metadata for the byte counts of input files which contributed to that output file. So for example if `app.js` imports `image.png` using the file loader and esbuild generates `out.js` and `image-LSAMBFUD.png`, the metadata for how many bytes of `out.js` are from `app.js` was slightly off (the metadata for the byte count of `out.js` was still correct). The reason is because esbuild substitutes the final paths for references between output files toward the end of the build to handle cyclic references, and the byte counts needed to be adjusted as well during the path substitution. This release fixes these byte counts (specifically the `bytesInOutput` values).\n\n-   The alias feature now strips a trailing slash ([#&#8203;2730](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2730))\n\n    People sometimes add a trailing slash to the name of one of node's built-in modules to force node to import from the file system instead of importing the built-in module. For example, importing `util` imports node's built-in module called `util` but importing `util/` tries to find a package called `util` on the file system. Previously attempting to use esbuild's package alias feature to replace imports to `util` with a specific file would fail because the file path would also gain a trailing slash (e.g. mapping `util` to `./file.js` turned `util/` into `./file.js/`). With this release, esbuild will now omit the path suffix if it's a single trailing slash, which should now allow you to successfully apply aliases to these import paths.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.8`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1508-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1507v1508-2022-12-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v15.0.7...v15.0.8)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   [`40aa6fe`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/40aa6fe9055f3fe673fda7032c7da8958d3f574d) [#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/253) bump fs-minipass from 2.1.0 to 3.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The intent of the newly-added `--packages=external` setting is to exclude a package's dependencies from the bundle. Since a package's subpath imports are only accessible within that package, it's wrong for them to be affected by `--packages=external`. This release changes esbuild so that `--packages=external` no longer affects subpath imports.\n\n-   Forbid invalid numbers in JSON files\n\n    Previously esbuild parsed numbers in JSON files using the same syntax as JavaScript. But starting from this release, esbuild will now parse them with JSON syntax instead. This means the following numbers are no longer allowed by esbuild in JSON files:\n\n    -   Legacy octal literals (non-zero integers starting with `0`)\n    -   The `0b`, `0o`, and `0x` numeric prefixes\n    -   Numbers containing `_` such as `1_000`\n    -   Leading and trailing `.` such as `0.` and `.0`\n    -   Numbers with a space after the `-` such as `- 1`\n\n-   Add external imports to metafile ([#&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/905), [#&#8203;1768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1768), [#&#8203;1933](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1933), [#&#8203;1939](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1939))\n\n    External imports now appear in `imports` arrays in the metafile (which is present when bundling with `metafile: true`) next to normal imports, but additionally have `external: true` to set them apart. This applies both to files in the `inputs` section and the `outputs` section. Here's an example:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       \"inputs\": {\n         \"style.css\": {\n           \"bytes\": 83,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ]\n         },\n         \"app.js\": {\n           \"bytes\": 100,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-statement\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        },\n             {\n               \"path\": \"style.css\",\n               \"kind\": \"import-statement\"\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       },\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/app.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"require-call\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"exports\": [],\n           \"entryPoint\": \"app.js\",\n           \"cssBundle\": \"out/app.css\",\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"app.js\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 113\n             },\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 528\n         },\n         \"out/app.css\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 100\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    One additional useful consequence of this is that the `imports` array is now populated when bundling is disabled. So you can now use esbuild with bundling disabled to inspect a file's imports.\n\n### [`v0.16.5`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0165)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.4...v0.16.5)\n\n-   Make it easy to exclude all packages from a bundle ([#&#8203;1958](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1958), [#&#8203;1975](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1975), [#&#8203;2164](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2164), [#&#8203;2246](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2246), [#&#8203;2542](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2542))\n\n    When bundling for node, it's often necessary to exclude npm packages from the bundle since they weren't designed with esbuild bundling in mind and don't work correctly after being bundled. For example, they may use `__dirname` and run-time file system calls to load files, which doesn't work after bundling with esbuild. Or they may compile a native `.node` extension that has similar expectations about the layout of the file system that are no longer true after bundling (even if the `.node` extension is copied next to the bundle).\n\n    The way to get this to work with esbuild is to use the `--external:` flag. For example, the [`fsevents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) package contains a native `.node` extension and shouldn't be bundled. To bundle code that uses it, you can pass `--external:fsevents` to esbuild to exclude it from your bundle. You will then need to ensure that the `fsevents` package is still present when you run your bundle (e.g. by publishing your bundle to npm as a package with a dependency on `fsevents`).\n\n    It was possible to automatically do this for all of your dependencies, but it was inconvenient. You had to write some code that read your `package.json` file and passed the keys of the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, and/or `optionalDependencies` maps to esbuild as external packages (either that or write a plugin to mark all package paths as external). Previously esbuild's recommendation for making this easier was to do `--external:./node_modules/*` (added in version 0.14.13). However, this was a bad idea because it caused compatibility problems with many node packages as it caused esbuild to mark the post-resolve path as external instead of the pre-resolve path. Doing that could break packages that are published as both CommonJS and ESM if esbuild's bundler is also used to do a module format conversion.\n\n    With this release, you can now do the following to automatically exclude all packages from your bundle:\n\n    -   CLI:\n\n            esbuild --bundle --packages=external\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        esbuild.build({\n          bundle: true,\n          packages: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          Bundle:   true,\n          Packages: api.PackagesExternal,\n        })\n        ```\n\n    Doing `--external:./node_modules/*` is still possible and still has the same behavior, but is no longer recommended. I recommend that you use the new `packages` feature instead.\n\n-   Fix some subtle bugs with tagged template literals\n\n    This release fixes a bug where minification could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f(x) {\n      let z = y.z\n      return z``\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return y.z``}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return(0,y.z)``}\n    ```\n\n    This release also fixes a bug where using optional chaining with `--target=es2019` or earlier could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj?.foo)``;\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo)``;\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    var __freeze = Object.freeze;\n    var __defProp = Object.defineProperty;\n    var __template = (cooked, raw) => __freeze(__defProp(cooked, \"raw\", { value: __freeze(raw || cooked.slice()) }));\n    var _a;\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo).call(obj, _a || (_a = __template([\"\"])));\n    ```\n\n-   Some slight minification improvements\n\n    The following minification improvements were implemented:\n\n    -   `if (~a !== 0) throw x;` => `if (~a) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a | b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a | b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a & b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a & b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a ^ b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a ^ b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a << b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a << b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >>> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >>> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a || !!b) throw x;` => `if (a || b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a && !!b) throw x;` => `if (a && b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (a ? !!b : !!c) throw x;` => `if (a ? b : c) throw x;`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But when looking at the output, it seems as if the useDefineForClassFields is set to true.\r\n\r\nThis setting causes the following example to be compiled/transpiled incorrectly, causing undefined errors:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass XYZ extends W {\r\nprivate readonly whatever = this.query.watch(\r\n    {},\r\n    {\r\n      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',\r\n    },\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly query: GetSomething\r\n  ) {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar _XYZ = class extends W {\r\n  constructor(query) {\r\n    super();\r\n    __publicField(this, \"query\");\r\n    __publicField(this, \"whatever\", this.query.watch({}, {\r\n      fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n    }));\r\n    this.query = query;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the above example the constructor assignment is done last. I initially thought it was due to esbuild, so I had already opened an issue there which pointed me to the typescript config.

https://github.com/bravier/browserslist-angular-15-repro`\r\n- `cd browserslist-angular-15-repro`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `npm run build`\r\n\r\nThis repo only contains a bare `ng new` app and simply [an additional commit](https://github.com/bravier/browserslist-angular-15-repro/commit/80f47dc221978426a2a4fb876b542418d51d6f40) that adds the `.browserslistrc` file.\r\n\r\nTo compare easily, this other repo is exactly the same but with Angular 14.2.10 and doing the exact same steps show no errors:\r\nhttps://github.com/bravier/browserslist-angular-14-repro\r\n\r\n### Exception or

You can download them here https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable. We use portable versions so that we can have multiple versions of the browser on the system and test several different versions by setting CHROME_BIN.\r\nI am trying to upgrade to angular 14, and I am running into an isssue that is only seen when using a portable version of a browser. When you run ng test, the tests run and when they are done, the browser stays open and the command never finishes. The command we are using is ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browser=chrome. This poses and issue in a CI system that waits for the command to finish.\r\nI am sure that this is just a small thing I am missing in the upgrade... If this was an intentional change, what is the preferred way to test across multiple versions of a browser? Multiple VMs?

To prevent this situation for development builds where a non-false `ngDevMode` is helpful to surface potential runtime problems, `GLOBAL_DEFS_FOR_TERSER_WITH_AOT` will no longer change the value of `ngDevMode`.

It abstracts away most of the gmaps logic that we heavily make use of in our apps.\r\n\r\nBut we're still missing one more functionality, namely an ng-like wrapper around the streetview panorama.\r\n\r\nAn ideal `map-streetview` component could go something like this:\r\n```html\r\n<map-streetview [map]=\"map\"\r\n                [overlays]=\"overlays\"\r\n                [...]=\"otherInputsLikePOVandPositionAndPitch\"\r\n                (pano_changed|position_changed|pov_changed...)=\"myHandler($event)\">\r\n```\r\nThe (optional) `@Input() map` would be the map that [allows binding to external panoramas](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L4210).\r\nThe (optional) `@Input overlays` would [support native gmaps overlays](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview#StreetViewOverlays) but ideally also this package's [`map-marker`](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps/map-marker)s. \r\nThe `@Output`s would be consistent with the standard [streetview events](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview#StreetViewEvents).\r\n\r\nSee section below for more details.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIn order to mirror [`map-marker`](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps/map-marker)s onto the panorama:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9054705/207418752-842ce069-9155-4907-908f-da7a77807c66.png)\r\n\r\nwe have to resort to the native JS API where we take advantage of the fact that `google.maps.Marker` instances get be bound to a `google.maps.StreetViewPanorama` [via `.setMap`](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-types/blob/346f9c9028e92a177cd6a76289e39d7407c99048/index.d.ts#L5138).\r\n\r\nWhen the map markers are dragged, we can listen to the position changes and update the streetview markers' positions accordingly:\r\n```typescript\r\n// keep the map marker and its corresponding panorama marker in sync\r\ngoogle.maps.event.addListener(rawMarker, 'position_changed', () => {\r\n    panoramaMarker.setPosition(rawMarker.getPosition().toJSON());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since we're using `map-markers` (and not the native `google.maps.Marker`s), we have to access the underlying native markers, pass them onto the native streetview and deal with \"component\" lifecycles manually.\r\n\r\nSumming up, it'd be neat to have a `map-streetview` component.\r\nIf it were to support custom overlays such as native markers (or any of the components [in this package](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps) that implement `google.maps.OverlayView`), all the better!\r\n\r\nThoughts?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26255","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(google-maps): Adding a streetview component\" (#26255)"},{"Id":"1494884704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-13T18:10:15","Actor":"parkb83","Number":"26254","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(checkbox): checkbox ripple remains after click","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a checkbox is selected or deselected, the final circular ripple shadow remains on display until something else is clicked.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Instead of using a fix value, it calculates the padding from the \"offset of the first item\".\r\n\r\nAlso, another issue (which is still open) #14842 clearly states that `@ContentChildren` does not find child elements created via `ngTemplateOutlet`.\r\n\r\nThese hand in hand break our code when we changed Angular version. Here is what happens:\r\n- We have a template for \"no-child menu items\"\r\n- The menu item is created by using `ngTemplateOutlet` when the menu item does not have any child element\r\n- Otherwise, a `button[mat-menu-item]` is created directly\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem, since the `_items` collection of the menu does not contain the elements created from the `ng-template` so the calculated \"padding\" is totally wrong (in our case 200px instead of 8px).\r\n\r\nA possible fix would be that instead of using the first item offset, the style of the first item's parent could be calculated using [window.getComputedStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle), for example.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (see [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-rlxajt?file=src/app/example-component.html)):\r\n\r\n1. Open the main menu\r\n2. Open a submenu (position is off)\r\n\r\nThe stackblitz is greatly simplified.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe appropriate padding should be calculated so the submenu can be shown in the right place.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe submenu is shown in the wrong place\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.2.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome

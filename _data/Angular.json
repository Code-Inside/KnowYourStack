This was now fixed with the recent Rules NodeJS\r\nv5 update where I made sure the `env.sh` variables are actually available before we\r\nwrite them to the temporary file for the Bazel-access.\r\n\r\nThis now will unveil an issue because payload size goldens would start being based\r\non their branch name. e.g. the golden key in `13.3.x` should not be `master` but\r\n`13.3.x`. This makes more sense than `master` as key, but makes things more\r\ncumbersome and ideally we would not store the branch name at all (this is a larger\r\nchange though -- not worth now since we might refactor this anyway -- the payload limits\r\nare always based on the currently checked-out branch/revision). For now we will\r\nupdate the size tracking logic to always use `master` as golden key (like it worked\r\nin the past year(s))\r\n\r\nWith the environment fix we now (again) start uploading payload size results to Firebase.\r\nThis did not work by accident either. The uploading logic is reliant on the CircleCI\r\ncommit range which is not working/reliable in upstream branches. This commit\r\nremoves this reliance on `COMMIT_RANGE` since it's not strictly necessary and\r\ncurrently breaking renovate PRs. We can re-enable this when we have a solution with\r\nCircleCI, or a workaround/resolution logic provided in e.g. `ng-dev ci determine-commit-range`.\r\n\r\n(Internal discussion for later reference: https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C029MM6RS4B/p1648240555186009)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45444","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: make payload size tracking script work with CircleCI and Bazel limitations\" (#45444)"},{"Id":"1181219991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T20:45:12","Actor":"devversion","Number":"45443","RawContent":null,"Title":"[13.3.x]: update to rules nodejs v5","State":"closed","Body":"Patch port of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45431","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[13.3.x]: update to rules nodejs v5\" (#45443)"},{"Id":"1181200512","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T19:41:41","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"45442","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.9\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45442","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.9\" with changelog.\" (#45442)"},{"Id":"1179911060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T19:18:41","Actor":"devversion","Number":"45431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rules NodeJS to v5","State":"closed","Body":"Continuation of #45235","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45431","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rules NodeJS to v5\" (#45431)"},{"Id":"1181175142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T19:14:57","Actor":"jerdog","Number":"45441","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs (core): add insights metrics widget to readme","State":"open","Body":"In addition to the existing badges which show the status of builds, etc., this new widget that shows the Insights metrics for your repo that shows how the default_workflow is performing.

Then I stumbled upon #42968 and I seem to have the same problem, but unfortunately a solution is not really presented. Here is basically my Stack Overflow question:\r\n\r\nI am trying to put various optional arguments into the `queryParams` of a route, but for some reason they popup shortly and get vanished again (as I am able to observe in the address bar of Chrome). Here is the setup of my component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.paginator.page.subscribe(() => {\r\n      console.log(`this.paginator.pageIndex: ${this.paginator.pageIndex}`);\r\n      this.router.navigate([], {\r\n        relativeTo: this.activatedRoute,\r\n        queryParams: { page: this.paginator.pageIndex },\r\n        queryParamsHandling: 'merge',\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    this.activatedRoute.queryParams.subscribe((params) => {\r\n      console.log(`params.page ${params.page}`);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    this.router.events.subscribe((event) => {\r\n      console.log(event);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich produces the following output in my VSCode Debug Console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.paginator.pageIndex: 2\r\nsrc/app/tiles/consumption-report/consumption-report-view-events/consumption-report-view-events.component.ts:142\r\nt {id: 4, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', navigationTrigger: 'imperative', restoredState: null}\r\nt {id: 4, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', state: t}\r\nt {id: 4, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', state: t}\r\nt {id: 4, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', state: t, shouldActivate: true}\r\nparams.page 2\r\nsrc/app/tiles/consumption-report/consumption-report-view-events/consumption-report-view-events.component.ts:138\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {routerEvent: t, position: null, anchor: null}\r\nt {id: 5, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', navigationTrigger: 'imperative', restoredState: null}\r\nt {id: 4, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents?page=2'}\r\nt {id: 5, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', state: t}\r\nt {id: 5, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', state: t}\r\nt {id: 5, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', state: t, shouldActivate: true}\r\nparams.page undefined\r\nsrc/app/tiles/consumption-report/consumption-report-view-events/consumption-report-view-events.component.ts:138\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {snapshot: e}\r\ne {routerEvent: t, position: null, anchor: null}\r\nt {id: 5, url: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents', urlAfterRedirects: '/consumptionReportManagement/viewEvents'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see `queryParams` get modified twice, once with the right arguments and then another time without the arguments. The same thing happens when I enter arguments via the address bar.\r\n\r\nI tried the following things to resolve this issue\r\n\r\n - Remove all guards from all of the routes (`RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)`)\r\n - I tried to track down where the routing events without the right `queryParams` come from in the debugger (without success, maybe due to a lack of knowledge)\r\n - I checked every `router.navigate` or `router.navigateByUrl` project wide to see if there is some side effects\r\n - Different variations of `router.navigate` with `queryParamsHandling: 'merge'` or `queryParamsHandling: 'preserve'`, `router.navigate(['.'], ...`, etc.\r\n - I googled for more than 5 hours without finding a hint that resolved my problem\r\n\r\nMaybe somebody knows (or even the creator @[msachin1](https://github.com/msachin1) of #42968) what library is possibly causing this issue or how to resolve this since the issues look pretty similar.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nThore\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 7.3.10\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.16\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n \r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.10\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.10\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.10\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.10\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.10\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular application suppresses queryParams\" (#45435)"},{"Id":"1180685074","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T11:33:54","Actor":"5te1n","Number":"45436","RawContent":null,"Title":"Input-Placeholder is empty after resetting a auto-completed input-field in firefox","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI have a strange behavior after I fill an input field using the autocomplete feature of the Firefox browser.\r\nThe placeholder disappears, then I reset the connected form control.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nInline event handlers are allowed in Angular templates as long as their\r\nvalues are constant. However, specifying such attributes currently leads\r\nto Trusted Types violations being generated, as Angular passes their\r\nconstant values as plain strings to setAttribute, which in this case is\r\na Trusted Types sink. This is made worse by a Chromium bug\r\n(https://crbug.com/993268) which treats any attribute starting with `on`\r\nas a Trusted Types sink, causing a Trusted Types violation when any\r\ncustom attribute starting with `on` is specified in an Angular template.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nFix this by promoting constant (and thus safe) values of inline event\r\nhandlers to TrustedScript before they are passed to the setAttribute\r\ncall. Note that all attributes that start with 'on' (e.g. 'onload' or\r\n'onerror') are promoted to a TrustedScript, even though they are not\r\nnecessarily an inline event handler (e.g. 'online' or 'one'). This is\r\nnot security sensitive and will essentially be a no-op as the values get\r\nstringified. This is done to work around the Chromium bug and minimize\r\ncode size impact, which would otherwise require listing all valid inline\r\nevent handler names in Angular's DOM schema.\r\n\r\nDevelopers interested in restricting usage of inline event handlers in\r\ntheir templates will still be able to do so by setting a Content\r\nSecurity Policy that does not include the 'unsafe-inline' directive.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45433","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): make inline event handlers compatible with Trusted Types\" (#45433)"},{"Id":"1179240500","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-24T21:32:08","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"45428","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency send to ^0.18.0","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [send](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send) | [`^0.17.1` -> `^0.18.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/send/0.17.2/0.18.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/compatibility-slim/0.17.2)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/confidence-slim/0.17.2)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pillarjs/send</summary>\n\n### [`v0.18.0`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send/blob/HEAD/HISTORY.md#&#8203;0180--2022-03-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send/compare/0.17.2...0.18.0)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   Fix emitted 416 error missing headers property\n-   Limit the headers removed for 304 response\n-   deps: depd@2.0.0\n    -   Replace internal `eval` usage with `Function` constructor\n    -   Use instance methods on `process` to check for listeners\n-   deps: destroy@1.2.0\n-   deps: http-errors@2.0.0\n    -   deps: depd@2.0.0\n    -   deps: statuses@2.0.1\n-   deps: on-finished@2.4.1\n-   deps: statuses@2.0.1\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

From ` 1.34s` to `0.76s`.\r\n\r\nThis will be important when we eventually introduce auto complete as users will get faster loopback.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22893","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): create package manager util class\" (#22893)"},{"Id":"1180164433","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T06:37:34","Actor":"ChaosNemesis","Number":"22890","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng build for production corrupts index.jsp","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\nng.cmd build --progress false --configuration production\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n✍️ Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was:  10, \r\nmigrated to 13 last month.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.7...14.0.0-next.8)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.6 are no longer supported.\n\n##### zone.js\n\n-   in TaskTrackingZoneSpec track a periodic task until it is cancelled\n\nThe breaking change is scoped only to the plugin\n`zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\nchecked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner\n._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\nits behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\npreviously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\ncallback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\nthe task is explicitly cancelled, e.g  with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\nfixes 45350\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [79d334b138](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/79d334b1385685d0fd1451534df2ed3cbaefa0b6) | feat | provide warnings for non-animatable CSS properties ([#&#8203;45212](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45212)) |\n| [2a75754ee8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2a75754ee823032e651bc596887a2186dc6846ae) | fix | apply default params when resolved value is null or undefined ([#&#8203;45339](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45339)) |\n\n##### bazel\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [dc72f3007a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dc72f3007ac74389ec02ea021a27f35770aa5a5d) | fix | ng module compilation workers are subject to linker race-conditions ([#&#8203;45393](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45393)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fffa023803](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fffa023803e5b04a58f0bd0b8667ee8b686aa530) | fix | scope css rules within `@layer` blocks ([#&#8203;45396](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45396)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [27b4af7240](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/27b4af7240ea964d1e4d51b83118f10321163627) | fix | full side-effectful registration of NgModules with ids ([#&#8203;45024](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45024)) |\n| [8155428ba6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8155428ba65c38c0c15f2666727202a7b360c1bd) | perf | ignore the module.id anti-pattern for NgModule ids ([#&#8203;45024](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45024)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c9d566ce4b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c9d566ce4b6e9097d9eceb7ac3964a0b25c404ad) | feat | drop support for TypeScript 4.4 and 4.5 ([#&#8203;45394](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45394)) |\n| [be161bef79](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/be161bef798ac5309df8390e3c2bba2cf84cb530) | fix | memory leak in event listeners inside embedded views ([#&#8203;43075](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/43075)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fe0e42a996](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fe0e42a996d5b70f4c0923cb6570c9a8032b1298) | fix | Make UntypedFormBuilder assignable to FormBuilder, and vice versa.

This works well but there are cases when running simple `npm install` is not enough. For example, last version of NPM might throw \"Unable to resolve dependency tree\" error. This can be easily fixed with an `--legacy-peer-deps` option. Unfortunately, this option is not available for `NodePackageInstallTask`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd ability to provide `legacyPeerDeps` option to `NodePackageInstallTask`. Even better solution would be to add opportunity to provide any custom options to `NodePackageInstallTask`. They should be passed down to command line automatically.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've tried to write my own `NodePackageInstallTask` with an extra option. But this didn't work. I've discovered that provided options are just meta-data for the executor (https://github.dev/angular/angular-cli/blob/366cabc66c3dd836e2fdfea8dad6c4c7c2096b1d/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.ts#L112). From executor code it is clear that there is a predefined set of options for NPM task and there is no way to override or extend this.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add legacyPeerDeps option to NodePackageInstallTask\" (#22886)"},{"Id":"1178182968","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-23T14:14:24","Actor":"Oznaprazzi","Number":"22885","RawContent":null,"Title":"Absolute paths broken in Angular 12+ for templateUrl and styleUrls","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am using Angular 13, upgraded from Angular 11 but after upgrading to Angular 12, the absolute paths stopped working for templateUrl and styleUrls.\r\n\r\nWhen I was with Angular 11, I had the AOT complier on and it was working.\r\n\r\nI'm needing to use absolute paths because I want to avoid having long relative paths and a lot of my components are using shared ```.scss``` and ```.html``` files for showing delete/restore confirm dialogs etc.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what I currently have in the components for templateUrl and styleUrls which is not working in Angular 12+ but still working in Angular 11.\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nIf I change the above to use relative path like below then it works but it doesn't look nice to have so many ```../../../```\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '../../../../example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['../../../../example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis is the templateUrl error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: path/to/directory/something.component.ts:9:18 - error NG2008: Could not find template file 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html'.\r\n\r\ntemplateUrl: 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html',\r\n```\r\nThis is the styleUrls error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss?ngResource' in 'C:\\Users\\...\\frontend'\r\n\r\nError: The loader \"C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss\" didn't return a string.\r\n```\r\nI've also tried adding paths like below to my tsconfig but it doesn't affect anything.\r\n```\r\n \"paths\": {\r\n      \"@env\": [\r\n        \"environments/environment\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@shared/*\": [\r\n        \"app/shared/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@core/*\": [\r\n        \"app/core/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"~*\": [\r\n        \"src/*\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI've seen answers suggesting to use raw-loader but I'm not quite sure how it works and if that's even the right solution here. I think it might be a complier config problem but haven't figured anything out.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's what my angular.json looks like\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"$schema\":

A brief description for the bug is:\r\n\r\nIncase of using the button-toggle *group* component with the input of `multi` set to `true` and passing a `name` input to the parent & different `name` inputs for the button-toggle *child* elements, the `name` (HTML attribute) for the *child* `button-toggle` elements are correctly applied at first, but if the `name` input for the button-toggle *group* element is changed again during the lifecycle of the component, the `name` (HTML attribute) for the *child* button-toggle elements simply inherits the `name` input value from the button-toggle *group*.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, upon the initial load (ngOnInit), the `name` input values passed to the button-toggle *child* elements is applied to them as their `name`(HTML attribute), but if the `name` input is changed for the button-toggle *group* component later on during the lifecycle of the component, (ngOnChanges), the *child* button-toggle elements simply uses the new `name` input passed to the parent button-toggle *group* component as their `name`(HTML attribute).\r\n\r\nPS: even though the use-cases for changing the name are slim, still there seems to be this small leak happening for the case of `multi` set as `true`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Stackblitz - https://components-issue-xzptzf.stackblitz.io\r\n2. Dynamically change the name input for the `mat-button-toggle-component` when the input of `multi` for the same is set to `true`\r\n3. Observe how the HTML name attribute of the `mat-button-toggle` gets overridden by the `name` input from the `mat-button-toggle-component`.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is:\r\n\r\n**The `name` input passed to the button-toggle group component in the case of `multi` set as `true` should only be applied to itself, and should not also be applied to the child button-toggles, as the child elements have their own `name` inputs.**\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n**The `name` input passed to the button-toggle group component in the case of `multi` set as `true` should also be applied to the child button-toggle elements during the initialization, and not only when the `name` input changes for the button-toggle component later during the lifecycle of the component.**\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCurrently, the `name` input passed to the button-toggle group component is not overriding the `name` value (later used as HTML attribute) during the initialization of the component, but only once the `name` input is changed for the button-toggle group component later in the lifecycle of the component.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): Irrespective\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Irrespective\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24666","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(button-toggle): changing the name input on button-toggle-group with multiple causes the name on button-toggle components to override\" (#24666)"},{"Id":"1179156163","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T15:48:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24656","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/testing): entering negative number values not working with reactive forms","State":"closed","Body":"We were entering negative values into number inputs character-by-character which doesn't appear to work with Angular's reactive forms.

For the mat-selection-list, the options need to be actually focused in order to be highlighted.\r\n\r\nThe main problem lies (at least i think so) lies in the usage of different ListKeyManagers for mat-select (ActiveDescendantKeyManager) and mat-selection-list (FocusKeyManager).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to use the ActiveDescendantKeyManager with the mat-selection-list?\r\n\r\nNote: Sorry if this obviously related to some accessibility requirement.\n\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\n\nI tried to listen to keyboard events and passing them to the underlying FocusKeyManager, but the FocusKeyManager does not provide any functionality to only set an active element, without actually focusing it.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse mat-selection-list with keyboard navigation.

animations are still being executed, this may not always be the desired behavior and may not be what developers always want.\r\n\r\nBut it does seem to be the intended code's behavior so it is not a bug (as the users can still get useful information in skipped animation callbacks).\r\n\r\nSo I was just thinking that maybe we could want to provide an option to avoid the execution of such

has the option to skip those callback if they prefer to \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis proposed feature is only for convenience, I don't think that those callbacks are a big hindrance and

[`v0.14.3`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0143)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.2...v0.14.3)\n\n-   Pass the current esbuild instance to JS plugins ([#&#8203;1790](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1790))\n\n    Previously JS plugins that wanted to run esbuild had to `require('esbuild')` to get the esbuild object. However, that could potentially result in a different version of esbuild. This is also more complicated to do outside of node (such as within a browser). With this release, the current esbuild instance is now passed to JS plugins as the `esbuild` property:\n\n    ```js\n    let examplePlugin = {\n      name: 'example',\n      setup(build) {\n        console.log(build.esbuild.version)\n        console.log(build.esbuild.transformSync('1+2'))\n      },\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Disable `calc()` transform for results with non-finite numbers ([#&#8203;1839](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1839))\n\n    This release disables minification of `calc()` expressions when the result contains `NaN`, `-Infinity`, or `Infinity`. These numbers are valid inside of `calc()` expressions but not outside of them, so the `calc()` expression must be preserved in these cases.\n\n-   Move `\"use strict\"` before injected shim imports ([#&#8203;1837](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1837))\n\n    If a CommonJS file contains a `\"use strict\"` directive, it could potentially be unintentionally disabled by esbuild when using the \"inject\" feature when bundling is enabled. This is because the inject feature was inserting a call to the initializer for the injected file before the `\"use strict\"` directive. In JavaScript, directives do not apply if they come after a non-directive statement. This release fixes the problem by moving the `\"use strict\"` directive before the initializer for the injected file so it isn't accidentally disabled.\n\n-   Pass the ignored path query/hash suffix to `onLoad` plugins ([#&#8203;1827](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1827))\n\n    The built-in `onResolve` handler that comes with esbuild can strip the query/hash suffix off of a path during path resolution. For example, `url(\"fonts/icons.eot?#iefix\")` can be resolved to the file `fonts/icons.eot`. For context, IE8 has a bug where it considers the font face URL to extend to the last `)` instead of the first `)`. In the example below, IE8 thinks the URL for the font is `Example.eot?#iefix') format('eot'), url('Example.ttf') format('truetype` so by adding `?#iefix`, IE8 thinks the URL has a path of `Example.eot` and a query string of `?#iefix') format('eot...` and can load the font file:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;font-face {\n      font-family: 'Example';\n      src: url('Example.eot?#iefix') format('eot'), url('Example.ttf') format('truetype');\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, the suffix is not currently passed to esbuild and plugins may want to use this suffix for something. Previously plugins had to add their own `onResolve` handler if they wanted to use the query suffix. With this release, the suffix can now be returned by plugins from `onResolve` and is now passed to plugins in `onLoad`:\n\n    ```js\n    let examplePlugin = {\n      name: 'example',\n      setup(build) {\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /.*/ }, args => {\n          return { path: args.path, suffix: '?#iefix' }\n        })\n\n        build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/ }, args => {\n          console.log({ path: args.path, suffix: args.suffix })\n        })\n      },\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The suffix is deliberately not included in the path that's provided to plugins because most plugins won't know to handle this strange edge case and would likely break. Keeping the suffix out of the path means that plugins can opt-in to handling this edge case if they want to, and plugins that aren't aware of this edge case will likely still do something reasonable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>piscinajs/piscina (piscina)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/releases/v3.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n```console\nnpm install piscina\n```\n\n```console\nyarn add piscina\n```\n\n-   Adds a new `PISCINA_DISABLE_ATOMICS` environment variable as an alternative way of\n    disabling Piscina's internal use of the `Atomics` API.

The old API will continue to be supported\nuntil Dart Sass 2.0.0, but it is now considered deprecated and should be avoided\nfor new code.\n\nThe new API includes:\n\n-   `compile()` and `compileAsync()` functions that take Sass file paths and\n    return the result of compiling them to CSS. The async function returns a\n    `Promise` rather than using a callback-based API.\n\n-   `compileString()` and `compileStringAsync()` functions that take a string of\n    Sass source and compiles it to CSS. As above, the async function returns a\n    `Promise`.\n\n-   A new importer API that more closely matches the Sass specification's logic\n    for resolving loads. This makes it much easier for Sass to cache information\n    across `@import` and `@use` rules, which substantially improves performance\n    for applications that rely heavily on repeated `@import`s.\n\n-   A new custom function API, including much more usable JS representations of\n    Sass value types complete with type-assertion functions, easy map and list\n    lookups, and compatibility with the [`immutable`][immutable] package. **Unlike in the\n    legacy API,** function callbacks now take one argument which contains an array\n    of Sass values (rather than taking a separate JS argument for each Sass\n    argument).\n\n[`immutable`]: https://immutable-js.com/\n\nFor full documentation of this API, please see [the Sass website][js-api].\n\n[js-api]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api\n\nThis release also adds TypeScript type definitions.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.1`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.3.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1)\n\n##### [5.3.1](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1) (2021-12-11)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   conflict core-js dependency ([#&#8203;2754](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/2754)) ([29d4551](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/29d4551e5bfc066a5ff7109786a73ec8e782a65f)) [@&#8203;juanpicado](https://togithub.com/juanpicado)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Specifically, the error and callstack I am getting looks like this on a dev build:\r\n![Callstack error chromecast require](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5759474/145563153-4230faa5-870c-4f30-909e-b1c65a33deef.png)\r\n\r\nI have created a reduced test example, uploaded on [stackblitz, here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-videojs-chromecast?file=package.json). The critical code may be found in the `vjs-player.component.ts` file, I have added some comments to make it as obvious as possible. Sadly, it is impossible to install @silvermine/videojs-chromecast on stackblitz for some reason, as it does not recognize the package as shown below:\r\n![installing videojs-chromecast on stackblitz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5759474/145564856-d0ea67cf-4b04-4958-b06f-e8c09169d15b.png)\r\n(if you try it, you will receive errors)\r\n\r\nTherefore, to truly reproduce the error, one has to build the project locally and then install the plugin using `npm install @silvermine/videojs-chromecast --save-dev`. Once that is done, remove the comments from the code rows as described in `vjs-player.component.ts`.\r\n\r\nI have looked at the [changes in Angular 13](https://angular.io/guide/update-to-latest-version) to try and find if anything breaks. So far, I have been unable to see anything that should be problematic for this plugin. The chromecast plugin is the only plugin I build using `require`, I have tried via various `import` methods, but get the same error.\r\n\r\nI have been looking around all sorts of other issue threads today mentioning webpack and I have yet to find something that replicates my problem exactly. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-videojs-chromecast?file=src/app/vjs-player/vjs-player.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nSee description.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.0\r\nNode: 14.15.4\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.10\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI had the same error with 13.0.3 / 13.0.4 yesterday (with typescript version 4.4.2), but tried with 13.1.0 today (and typescript 4.5.2), but the problem persists.

However, some\r\nscreenreaders did not announce the cells as interactable and treated it\r\nthe same as a cell in a static table (e.g. VoiceOver announces element\r\ntype incorrectly #23476).\r\n\r\nThis changes the DOM structure to use buttons\r\ninside of a gridcell to make it more explicit that the table cells can\r\nbe interacted with and are not static content. The gridcell role is\r\nstill present to table navigation will continue to work, but the `td`\r\nelements are now buttons. The gridcell wrapper is only for adding\r\ninformation to the a11y tree and not used for visual purposes.\r\n\r\nUpdated DOM structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div\r\n  role=\"gridcell\"\r\n  style=\"display: contents;\"\r\n>\r\n  <td\r\n   role=\"button\"\r\n   aria-disabled=\"false\"\r\n   aria-current=\"date\"\r\n   aria-selected=\"true\"\r\n   <!-- ... -->\r\n  >\r\n   <!-- additional details ommited -->\r\n  </>\r\n<button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried another approach of keeping the `<td/>` as a\r\n`gridcell`, and rendering a button inside of it. This turned out to be\r\nmuch more complicated with getting the keyboard navigation and focusing\r\nlogic to work correctly. It also make writing the tests more complicated\r\nbecause tests need to know if they should select the body cell or the\r\nbutton nested inside of it.

Unfortunately, these HCM focus indicators conflict with the existing system-wide strong focus indicators if the user has opted into strong focus indicators.

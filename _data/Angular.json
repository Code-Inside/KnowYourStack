Implementing a cross-language schema is more difficult, plus JavaScript/TypeScript is what most people are using (I don't know if other language support even exists).\n\nAngular is the only remaining major framework to not have the ability for a specific TypeScript interface to be augmented:\n\n- **Solid.js**: augment `solid-js` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Vue**: augment `vue` module's `GlobalComponents`\n- **Svelte**: augment the global `svelteHTML.IntrinsicElements` or augment `svelte/elements` module's `SvelteHTMLElements`\n- **React**: augment `react` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Preact**: augment `preact` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements` with the same definition as for react with react compat enabled\n- **Angular**: n/a\n\nThe usage could look this,\n\n```ts\n// `angular` module\n\nexport type GlobalCSSValues = 'inherit' | 'initial' | 'etc'\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface CSSProperties {\n\tvisibility: 'hidden' | 'visible' | 'collapse' | GlobalCSSValues\n\tdisplay: 'none' | 'block' | 'inline' | 'etc' | GlobalCSSValues\n\t// ... etc ...\n}\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface IntrinsicElements {\n  div: { /* ... */ }\n  button: : { /* ... */ }\n  // ... etc ...\n}\n```\n```ts\n// user code\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n    // plus generic types for Angular's special bindings can be provided out of the box (insead of the user writing them here):\n    & type Obj = {\n\t// [class.foo]= bindings\n\t[K in `class.${string}`]?: boolean\n    } & {\n\t// [style.known]= bindings\n\t[K in keyof CSSProperties as `style.${keyof CSSProperties}`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n    } & {\n\t// [style.unknown]= bindings\n\t[K in `style.${string}`]?: string\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nor similar.\n\nHere's an example of the special `style.` and `class.` binding types in TypeScript playground:\n\n[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#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)\n\n\nThe generic `style.` and `class.` stuff can be provided as a default with a helper from `angular`, for example:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nHeck, you could even require the syntax to match, for sake of consistency with template syntax, and it is possible thanks to TypeScript template string types:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      '[attr.foo]'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      '(some-event)'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n```ts\n// and similar for the builtin props:\nexport type IntrinsicBindings = {\n  // [class.foo]= bindings\n  [K in `[class.${string}]`]?: boolean\n} & {\n  // [style.known]= bindings\n  [K in keyof CSSProperties as `[style.${keyof CSSProperties}]`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n} & {\n  // [style.unknown]= bindings\n  [K in `[style.${string}]`]?: string\n}\n```\n\nLibrary authors making custom element libraries can then make their own mapped-type helpers to map their element class properties, for example, to property, attribute, and event types, and they can even expand the `class.` and `style.` types if needed.\n\nFor example, given a class like this:\n\n```js\nimport {attribute, element, event} from 'some-lib' // For example, https://github.com/lume/element\n\nexport\n@element('my-element')\nclass MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n  @attribute foo: \"foo\" | \"bar\" = \"foo\" // the initial value when no foo attribute is set (or foo attribute is removed)\n\n  @event 'onsome-event': ((event: SomeEvent) => void) | null = null\n\n  // ... implementation omitted ...\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nthen a custom element author can define their own mapped type (as they already will be doing for React, Preact, Solid, Vue, Svelte, and others) to make it easy to define element types for their specific custom element library:\n\n```ts\nimport type {ElementAttributesForAngular} from 'some-lib/vue-types'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    // pick the properties to be used for Angular template types (any not listed are omitted from template type checking)\n    'my-element': ElementAttributesForAngular<MyEl, 'foo' | 'onsome-event'>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nImplement a schema, and the tooling needed to map that to TypeScript (and other language) definitions like in #12045? Good luck! I imagine that's why #12045 has been open for 8 years since 2016.\n\nA TypeScript interface would much easier to provide because TypeScript is the current foundation, and it would be immediately usable by a large amount of web developers. \n\nPeople can also use TypeScript definitions as a source for mapping to other languages, so even having just TypeScript support would be a better starting point than a more difficult schema idea.\n\nThere are already tools like [TypeScript-to-Flow](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-flow) converters, so starting with a TypeScript interface right now, would be valuable a lot more quickly than #12045.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[language-server] TypeScript interface for element definitions (including for custom elements)\" (#58483)"},{"Id":"2630872997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T23:58:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"58482","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): correctly add external stylesheets to ShadowDOM components","State":"open","Body":"Angular components that use ShadowDOM view encapsulation have an alternate execution path for adding component styles to the DOM that does not use the SharedStylesHost that all other view encapsulation modes leverage.

When upgrading to Angular 19 these tests broke.  Here's a simple example:\n\n```\ndescribe('customSignal', () => {\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<unknown>;\n  let injector: Injector;\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    fixture = createFixture();\n    injector = fixture.componentRef.injector;\n  });\n\n  fit('should do something', () => {\n    const sut = customSignal(5, { injector });\n    sut.set(6);\n    TestBed.flushEffects(); // Used to work in Angular 19.\n    expect(sut()).toBe(24); // Expectation fails because an update that was supposed to be made by an internal effect didn't occur.\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThere are several work arounds:\n* Create the signal inside runInInjectionContext: `const sut = TestBed.runInInjectionContext(() => customSignal(5));`\n* Pass an injected *Injector* to the signal: `const sut = customSignal(5, { inject: TestBed.inject(Injector) });`\n* Use `fixture.detectChanges()` instead of `TestBed.flushEffects()`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

exception or error you saw\n\nThe changes that should occur after using `TestBed.flushEffects()` do not occur and my test expectations fail.\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this

In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-11-03T03:30:02.2452262Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1427}

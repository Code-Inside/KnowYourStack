Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nThe UpgradeModule wraps the AngularJS `$interval` service with some zonejs-related behaviour necessary for a hybrid app. angular-mocks also decorates `$interval` with a `flush` method for testing. Currently, the UpgradeModule does not add the $flush method (if present) on the original $interval to its wrapper. This causes an \"$interval.flush is not a function\" error if you are initializing the UpgradeModule in an existing angularjs test that uses angular-mocks and $interval.flush. \r\n\r\n(I am initializing the UpgradeModule in an angularjs test because one of the components in the code under test is now an Angular component that is being used in AngularJS with `downgradeComponent`).\r\n \r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThis PR adds the `$interval.flush` method to the UpgradeModule's $interval wrapper, so existing angularjs tests that use `$interval.flush` can also use downgraded components. \r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nI am currently looking for the correct place to introduce a test for this code.

The angular-cli creates the import of crisis-center module after the AppRoutingModule. This will be an issue for the code.\r\n\r\nWhen a **Wildcard route** is defined in the **AppRoutingModule**, the wildcard route will be matched before the child route in the crisis-center routing can be matched. This happens very often wenn using the angular-cli to added submodule with routing feature.\r\n\r\nThe natrual way of adding Wildcard route is in the AppRoutingModule, and then always place the AppRoutingModule after all submodule in the import array of the AppModule. The debugging of such error relating to the routes match due to the import placement order is very difficult.  Thus, i suggest to improve the original doc text to hightlight this issue to prevent error in coding and improve the readers understanding of the impact of the placement order in the imports array of the angular modules.  \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/router#import-crisis-center-module-into-the-appmodule-routes\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Angular app, run `ng update @angular/cli@next @angular/core@next`. \r\n\r\nRun `ng build --prod`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThe built files will not support differential loading.\r\n\r\nWe should automatically check / fix this setting in an `ng update` schematic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0-rc.2\r\nNode: 12.1.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular:

This change limits the loading to only the command being executed in the common case and a subset of commands in the event an alias is used.  The help command now loads all commands during its execution which is needed to gather command description information.  Further improvements are possible by only loading the necessary metadata instead of the execution code (and its dependencies) as well.\r\nThis change allows for savings of ~250ms per execution and

wrong value.\r\nThe following code provides ` {prop1:{prop1:\"prop1\",prop2:\"prop2\"},prop2:undefined} ` instead of `{prop1:\"prop1\",prop2:\"prop2\"}`:\r\n```\r\npublic static forRoot(\r\n    { prop1 = \"prop1\", prop2 = \"prop2\" }: Partial<Bug>\r\n): ModuleWithProviders\r\n{\r\n    return {\r\n        ngModule: BugModule,\r\n        providers: [\r\n            { provide: BUG_TOKEN, useValue: { prop1, prop2 } },\r\n        ]\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI inspected the generated `main.*.js` and it seems like the AoT-build inlines the value, but it is not calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nA minimal reproduction can be found [here](https://github.com/Springrbua/aot-destructuring-bug).\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Execute `ng build --prod`\r\n2. Open `main.*.js` and search for `prop1`. You will find the following Object:  \r\n    `{prop1:{prop1:\"First Property\",prop2:\"Second Property\"},prop2:void 0}`\r\n3. Open `bug.module.ts` and enable the workaround by removing the comment form line 9 and line 16 and putting line 8 and line 15 in comment instead.\r\n4. Run `ng build --prod` again.\r\n5. Open the new `main.*.js` and search for `prop1` again. Now the Object has the correct value  \r\n    `{prop1:\"First Property\",prop2:\"Second Property\"}`\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 10.14.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.8\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.8\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI was looking for this issue and found an article on angular.io, which says that [Destructured variables are not supported in AoT](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#destructured-variable-not-supported).  \r\nI am not sure if this also applies for my example, but if it does, it should probably show an error instead of resulting in a wrong bundle.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14302","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Deconstrucoring and AoT\" (#14302)"},{"Id":"438043128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-28T13:08:40","Actor":"mattlewis92","Number":"14299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 8 injectable pipe migration schematic produces invalid code","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAfter running the v8 schematic it produces invalid code.

This way the `baseUrl` for e2e test run will be created correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the value of `baseUrl` option passed in protractor config could be respected, and concatenated with the calculated host from `publicHost` option. However, this way there is duplicate configuration: base url will be specified both for serve command and for e2e command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, set the serve configuration options as following:\r\n```json\r\n\"options\": {\r\n    \"browserTarget\": \"myapp:build\",\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"/custom-namespace/\",\r\n    \"publicHost\": \"https://localhost/custom-namespace/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `ng e2e`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe browser will open with URL: `https://localhost/` instead of `https://localhost/custom-namespace/`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\nIt seems that my environment is older compared to the latest commit in this repository.

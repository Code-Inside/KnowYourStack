This has been the subject of debate in the past (#42490). The core of the discussions is that it is often desirable (and perhaps expected) that they natural ordering of the input is respected. There are at least two workarounds to restore natural ordering, such as a `compareFn` that simply returns `1` or a custom pipe. However, both of these require code for pipe consumers to maintain or  copy around to many places.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nAllowing `null` as `compareFn` and treating it as \"natural order\" is fairly simple to understand, backward compatible and was suggested a few times on #42490 where it seemed to be received well. Using `null` is also possible in templates without any component code changes.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n *n/a*","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57487","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): disable keyvalue sorting using null compareFn\" (#57487)"},{"Id":"2480800119","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-22T13:30:27","Actor":"HimanshuMahto","Number":"57485","RawContent":null,"Title":"Field value in component class updates but does not revert back","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n<nb-checkbox\r\n    status=\"primary\"\r\n    class=\"select-checkbox\"\r\n    [indeterminate]=\"isIndeterminate\"\r\n    [(ngModel)]=\"isSelectAll\"\r\n    (checkedChange)=\"onSelectAllClicked($event)\"\r\n  ></nb-checkbox>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  the code above what I'm trying is that when I click on checkbox and if more than 0 check box are checked then show a button to cancel the process which I am going to perform on it. it work in case of indeterminate checkbox but in case when I select all the checkbox using selectall then in that case if I cancel the process still the checkbox are set to be check which should not happen and this issue is not coming in case of indeterminate checkboxes.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57485","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Field value in component class updates but does not revert back\" (#57485)"},{"Id":"2480572958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-22T12:47:54","Actor":"JonathanCabezas","Number":"57483","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular compiler ignores tsconfig.json \"references\" field","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler-cli, compiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo repository following this structure:\r\n```\r\n| apps\r\n  | web-app <- The Angular project\r\n    | tsconfig.json <- contains: \"references\": { \"path\": \"../../packages/shared\"};\r\n| packages\r\n  | shared\r\n    | src\r\n      | product.ts <- contains: import { Unit } from \"src/conditioning\";\r\n      | conditioning.ts\r\n    | tsconfig.json <- contains: \"baseUrl\": \"./\"\r\n    | package.json <- ESM module (\"types\": \"module)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` is ignored by the Angular compiler although it is referenced in `apps/web-app/tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\n`ng serve` and `ng build` fails with `✘ [ERROR] TS2307: Cannot find module 'src/conditioning' or its corresponding type declarations.

That goes kind of against the RxJS paradigm. When working with streams you expect to code regardless of time of execution and streams are specifically there to fix situation where you are dependent on value that is not there for the time being. \r\n\r\nWhat makes it worse is it works differently for `ngModel` and `formControl`. Consider this directive:\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: '[valueChanges]',\r\n})\r\nexport class ValueChangesDirective {\r\n  private readonly control = inject(NgControl);\r\n\r\n  @Output()\r\n  readonly valueChanges = defer(() => this.control.valueChanges!);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBy the time somebody subscribes to `(valueChanges)` output in the template, `ngModel` versions is ready, while `FormControl` version is not. This makes it impossible to reliably chain control value changes to directive outputs.\r\n\r\nI realize these streams are recreated in `ngOnChanges` because `FormControl` is passed as input, rather than created internally as in `ngModel`, but it would be nice if those streams would exist since the beginning as subjects and controls would feed values to them, instead of recreating them.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/value-changes-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54418","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`valueChanges` is slow to initiate\" (#54418)"},{"Id":"2132446735","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T14:27:01","Actor":"JayakumarrDotnet","Number":"54417","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ng Update not working properly","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nng update @angular/core@12 @angular/cli@12\r\n\r\nError\r\nPackage '@angular/core' is not a dependency.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nng update @angular/core@12 @angular/cli@12\r\n\r\nError\r\nPackage '@angular/core' is not a dependency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54417","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ng Update not working properly\" (#54417)"},{"Id":"2131971416","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T14:16:01","Actor":"secorrenti","Number":"54411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Two way databinding not working depending on how you write the template.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis not work as expected :-(\r\n**Note, the value is updated after the function finish (because the order of the template)**\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n<cib-user-card-management-new-card-message\r\n(cardIssuingChange)=\"cardIssuingToggle($event)\"  <--- move this below the @input \r\n[cardIssuing]=\"cardIssuing\"\r\n>\r\n</cib-user-card-management-new-card-message>\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nLike this \r\nThis work as expected :-)\r\n(because the @Output is below the @Input)\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n<cib-user-card-management-new-card-message\r\n[cardIssuing]=\"cardIssuing\"\r\n(cardIssuingChange)=\"cardIssuingToggle($event)\"\r\n>\r\n</cib-user-card-management-new-card-message>\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54411","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Two way databinding not working depending on how you write the template.\" (#54411)"},{"Id":"2132360798","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T13:47:17","Actor":"rolanddeboer","Number":"54416","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in link on page \"https://angular.dev/guide/http\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nUnder the section \"What's next\" on `https://angular.dev/guide/http` there is a link called \"Making HTTP Requests\" to `https://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requets`\r\nThat is a typo: should be `.../making-requests`.

The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit e75aa9b5818082f2928b777d690027547b62bf9f)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27092","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downgrade copy-webpack-plugin to workaround Node.js support issue\" (#27092)"},{"Id":"2132328902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T13:52:13","Actor":"Carlosamouco","Number":"27091","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add option to include pre bundle deps in the `application` builder","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27021 an option to exclude dependencies from being pre bundled was added.\r\nIf we are trying to exclude a dependency that has nested common js dependencies, those should be pre bundled as stated in https://vitejs.dev/config/dep-optimization-options.html#optimizedeps-exclude.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nExpose an option for including dependencies to be pre bundled similar to exclude option.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27091","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add option to include pre bundle deps in the `application` builder\" (#27091)"},{"Id":"2132309120","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T13:33:01","Actor":"csvn","Number":"27090","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make native CSS nesting configurable","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, config, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNative support for [CSS Nesting](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/css-nesting) is now supported in [all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting). Though I can't find any way to avoid CSS compiler downgrading CSS to equivalent non-nested CSS.\r\n\r\nFor our app, we only support latest browser version, so for us it would be beneficial to use native CSS nesting to make CSS less verbose and builds smaller.\r\n\r\nI tried generating new Angular project with 17.1.3, and setting a `.browserslistrc` (below), but it does not use native CSS nesting.\r\n```\r\nlast 1 Chrome versions\r\nlast 1 Firefox versions\r\nlast 1 Safari major versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/8770194/d2b5315f-cb8f-4cbe-9ddf-8ecde4fe4bd3)\r\n\r\nIf native CSS nesting was used, the above should be something like:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  background-color: steelblue;\r\n\r\n  h1[_ngcontent-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think there's two viable solutions for activating native CSS nesting:\r\n\r\n- Via `.browserslists`, to use native CSS nesting when all selected browsers supports it\r\n- By having a flag in the `angular.json` config to disable nesting plugin for `.css`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a workaround, as far as I know.

But when I'm bumping an Angular _minor_ I'm surprised I'm expected by the framework authors to run _migrations scripts_ - because minors shouldn't contain breaking changes. 🤔 \r\n\r\nI've seen the comment: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26349#issuecomment-1809580491\r\n> Latest localtunnel (2.0.2) [is still using](https://unpkg.com/localtunnel@2.0.2/package.json) a vulnerable axios (0.21.4).

Specifically, when users attempt to scroll through the options presented in the autocomplete dropdown, the scroll action unexpectedly affects the underlying webpage instead of the dropdown list. This behavior disrupts the user's ability to select an option from the autocomplete list and significantly impacts the usability of the component. The issue has been consistently observed across a variety of devices and web browsers, indicating a broader compatibility or event handling problem within the component.\r\n\r\nVideo Demonstration of the Issue:\r\nhttps://javamaniac.github.io/angular-autocomplete-example/screen-20240212-143204.mp4\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/javamaniac/angular-autocomplete-example\r\n\r\nThe issue with mat-autocomplete scrolling is intermittent and does not have a consistent reproduction sequence. However, it generally involves interactions with the autocomplete component on a mobile device. Below are steps that have sometimes led to the issue, though it may require repeating certain actions or experimenting with the sequence to observe the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential Reproduction Sequences:\r\n\r\nBasic Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nExtended Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Select any option from the list.\r\n3. Clear the selected option (erase the choice).\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options again.\r\n\r\nExternal Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Click outside the dropdown to close it.\r\n3. Re-open the dropdown.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue may not manifest on the first attempt and could require varying the sequence of actions, such as selecting and clearing choices multiple times or opening and closing the dropdown before scrolling attempts are made. The problem appears to be more likely to occur after interacting with the dropdown in some way (selecting options, erasing choices, or clicking outside the dropdown) before attempting to scroll through the options again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDragging (scrolling) within the mat-autocomplete dropdown should scroll through the autocomplete options.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAttempting to scroll through the autocomplete options results in the page itself scrolling.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16, 17 (issue likely affects older versions as well)\r\n- CDK/Material: 16, 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Edge, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android, iOS\r\n\r\nDevices tested:\r\n- Google Pixel 6 (Chrome, Edge)\r\n- iPhone SE (Chrome, Safari)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/autocomplete): Intermittent Scrolling Issue with mat-autocomplete on Mobile Devices\" (#28581)"},{"Id":"2130777176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T19:32:53","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28580","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): fix m3 demo trailing icon color","State":"closed","Body":"Fix trailing icon color in M3 List demo.

However, if your method uses signals conditionally, which is quite normal, they won't execute on the initial run, and then the change detection won't work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis issue can be addressed from two sides - interface extension, for the run-time, and/or test-mode provisions.\r\n\r\nWe can add manual/override extension on what signals trigger the `effect` execution, by extending `CreateEffectOptions` with the following:\r\n\r\n* Option `signals` - optional array of signals that can trigger the `effect` execution.\r\n* Option `policy` / `strategy` - defines how `signals` option is to be treated:\r\n   * `add` (default) - specified list of `signals` is an addition to the ones that `effect` execution detects.\r\n   * `replace` - the `effect` won't be tracking signals from its execution, and instead execute `effect` when any of the specified signals trigger\r\n   * `match` - on the initial run and signal detection, `effect` will compare the list of triggered signals versus the list specified, and should the two sets not match, an error is to be thrown. This is primarily for automated tests.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIn addition, and partially instead, `EffectRef` should provide a protocol for subscribing to (at least) the initial run, and report (as parameters) the list of signals that triggered.\r\n\r\nThis in itself is quite necessary, and also, if implemented, will let us simplify the `policy` option above to just an `add/replace` boolean, as `match` will no longer be needed (though a nice-have addition), as tests can check the list of signals triggered during the initial run.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50435","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals - Extended Detection + Testability\" (#50435)"},{"Id":"1722560044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-23T18:28:47","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"50433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: update babel dependencies to v7.21.9 (#50416)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 3c093d767e7a7aeef0999c5c15b0c4c23bc2bc79.\r\n\r\nIt broke symbol generation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50433","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: update babel dependencies to v7.21.9 (#50416)\"\" (#50433)"},{"Id":"1722537954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-23T17:56:37","Actor":"brandonroberts","Number":"50432","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature]: Allow for lazy loading of each route config","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can eagerly load an entire route config, but if you include providers, guards, and other tokens they will be included in the main bundle even for a lazy loaded component/routes.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'page',\r\n    canActivate: [authGuardFunction, permissionsGuardFunction],\r\n    loadChldren: () => import('features/page')\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'other-page',\r\n    canActivate: [authGuardFunction, permissionsGuardFunction],\r\n    loadComponent: () => import('about.component')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow you to provide a route config with a `path` and a `loadConfig/loadRoute` that resolves to the rest of the route configuration, and would be resolved on the matching of that path before proceeding.

[In the HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes), boolean attributes are considered `true` if they are present on a DOM node and `false` if they are omitted. Common examples of boolean attributes are `disabled` on interactive elements like `<button>` or `checked` on `<input type=\"checkbox\">`. Another example of an attribute that is defined as a string, but interpreted as a different type is the `value` attribute of `<input type=\"number\">` which logs a warning and ignores the value if it can't be parsed as a number.\r\n\r\nHistorically, authoring Angular inputs that match the native behavior in a type-safe way has been difficult for developers, because Angular interprets all static attributes as strings. While some recent TypeScript versions made this easier by allowing setters and getters to have different types, supporting this pattern still requires a lot of boilerplate and additional properties to be declared. For example, currently developers have to write something like this to have a `disabled` input that behaves like the native one:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {Directive, Input} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Directive({selector: 'mat-checkbox'})\r\nexport class MatCheckbox {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  get disabled() {\r\n    return this._disabled;\r\n  }\r\n  set disabled(value: any) {\r\n    this._disabled = typeof value === 'boolean' ? value : (value != null && value !== 'false');\r\n  }\r\n  private _disabled = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature aims to address the issue by introducing a `transform` property on inputs. If an input has a `transform` function, any values set through the template will be passed through the function before being assigned to the directive instance. The example from above can be rewritten to the following:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {Directive, Input, booleanAttribute} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Directive({selector: 'mat-checkbox'})\r\nexport class MatCheckbox {\r\n  @Input({transform: booleanAttribute}) disabled: boolean = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes also add the `booleanAttribute` and `numberAttribute` utilities to `@angular/core` since they're common enough to be useful for most projects.\r\n\r\nFixes #8968.\r\nFixes #14761.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50420","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): add ability to transform input values\" (#50420)"},{"Id":"1721185097","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-23T05:05:29","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"50417","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [https-proxy-agent](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents) | resolutions | minor | [`6.1.0` -> `6.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/https-proxy-agent/6.1.0/6.2.0) |\n| [puppeteer-core](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)) | devDependencies | minor | [`20.2.1` -> `20.3.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/puppeteer-core/20.2.1/20.3.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents</summary>\n\n### [`v6.2.0`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;620)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@6.1.0...https-proxy-agent@6.2.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   [`8ff9faa`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/8ff9faa): \"headers\" option can now be a function\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`66b4c63`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/66b4c63)]\n    -   agent-base@7.0.2\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v20.3.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.3.0): puppeteer-core: v20.3.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.2.1...puppeteer-core-v20.3.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add an ability to trim cache for Puppeteer ([#&#8203;10199](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10199)) ([1ad32ec](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1ad32ec9948ca3e07e15548a562c8f3c633b3dc3))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   ElementHandle dragAndDrop should fail when interception is disabled ([#&#8203;10209](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10209)) ([bcf5fd8](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/bcf5fd87aeeb822203c3388e8aa6dadaa0107690))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

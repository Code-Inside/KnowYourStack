The following contrived example demonstrates the issue i've come across.\r\n\r\n[Example 1](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ve86vi?file=src%2Fmain.ts) using Input and ContentChildren decorators\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport 'zone.js';\r\nimport { BookListComponent } from './components/book-list/book-list.component';\r\nimport { BookComponent } from './components/book/book.component';\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BookListComponent,\r\n    BookComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <book-list>\r\n      <book title='title 1'></book>\r\n      <book title='title 2'></book>\r\n      <book title='title 3'></book>\r\n    </book-list>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {\r\n  name = 'Angular';\r\n}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[BookListComponent](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ve86vi?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fbook-list%2Fbook-list.component.ts)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, ContentChildren, QueryList } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BookComponent } from '../book/book.component';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'book-list',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  templateUrl: './book-list.component.html',\r\n  styleUrl: './book-list.component.scss',\r\n})\r\nexport class BookListComponent {\r\n  @ContentChildren(BookComponent)\r\n  books?: QueryList<BookComponent>;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterContentInit() {\r\n    console.log('ngAfterContentInit::BookListComponent');\r\n    this.books?.forEach((book) => {\r\n      console.log('Book innerTitle:', book.innerTitle);\r\n    });\r\n    console.log('=====================================');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[BookComponent](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ve86vi?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fbook%2Fbook.component.ts)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'book',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  templateUrl: './book.component.html',\r\n  styleUrl: './book.component.scss',\r\n})\r\nexport class BookComponent {\r\n  @Input({ required: true }) title?: string;\r\n\r\n  innerTitle?: string;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    console.log('ngOnInit::BookComponent');\r\n    this.innerTitle = `inner title -

title 1\r\nBook innerTitle: inner title - title 2\r\nBook innerTitle: inner title - title 3\r\n=====================================\r\n```\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n[This example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-aaoahu?file=src%2Fmain.ts) implements the same functionality but the decorators have been replaced with `input` and `contentChildren` signals.\r\n\r\n[BooklistComponent](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-aaoahu?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fbook-list%2Fbook-list.component.ts)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, contentChildren, effect } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BookComponent } from '../book/book.component';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'book-list',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  templateUrl: './book-list.component.html',\r\n  styleUrl: './book-list.component.scss',\r\n})\r\nexport class BookListComponent {\r\n  books = contentChildren(BookComponent);\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    effect(() => {\r\n      console.log('effect:contentChildren::BookListComponent');\r\n      this.books()?.forEach((book) => {\r\n        console.log('Book innerTitle:', book.innerTitle);\r\n      });\r\n      console.log('=====================================');\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngAfterContentInit() {\r\n    console.log('ngAfterContentInit::BookListComponent');\r\n    this.books()?.forEach((book) => {\r\n      console.log('Book innerTitle:', book.innerTitle);\r\n    });\r\n    console.log('=====================================');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[BookComponent](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-aaoahu?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fbook%2Fbook.component.ts)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, effect, input } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'book',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  templateUrl: './book.component.html',\r\n  styleUrl: './book.component.scss',\r\n})\r\nexport class BookComponent {\r\n  title = input.required<string>();\r\n\r\n  innerTitle?: string;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    effect(() => {\r\n      console.log('effect:input::BookComponent');\r\n      this.innerTitle = `inner title - ${this.title()}`;\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    console.log('ngOnInit::BookComponent');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the following output, the child component signal `input` value does not change before the `contentChildren` signal value changes. So at the point access to the content children components executes (within the `effect` in the `BookListComponent` constructor), `BookComponent` has not yet been initialised.\r\n\r\n```\r\nngOnInit::BookComponent\r\nngOnInit::BookComponent\r\nngOnInit::BookComponent\r\n=====================================\r\nngAfterContentInit::BookListComponent\r\nBook innerTitle: undefined\r\nBook innerTitle: undefined\r\nBook innerTitle: undefined\r\n=====================================\r\neffect:contentChildren::BookListComponent\r\nBook innerTitle:

I am curious as to whether Angular did not use core-js because it was intended to target the latest browsers as shown in the document above. Also, there may be services that support a wide browser target like ours, but I am wondering if there are any plans to include core-js.\r\n\r\n2. If there are no plans to modify, In order to inject polyfills for ECMAScript functions, \r\nshould services that use Angular go in the direction of specifying core-js separately in polyfills.ts?\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. I know that you always put a lot of effort into creating a good framework, and I am grateful.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nInserting core-js when building\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI can't think of any additional alternatives.

Create a fresh angular 17 app\r\n1. In VSCode add a `console.error({error})` in the AngularCLI's file `node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.js` in line 80 (inside this `catch` block):\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ea843ebfeaa2e1a232bf199b624f7084e35399b9/packages/angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.ts#L102-L106\r\nsee example:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/4001059/2117bcfa-35b5-4521-a1f1-4170c6bf85f0)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. (run `npm install @my/lib` - to mitigate the bug https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16320 - but ideally this step shouldn't be needed when this other bug is fixed)\r\n1. run `ng add @my/library@<with-version-here>`\r\n1. See an error in the console `error: CollectionCannotBeResolvedException [Error]: Collection \"@my/lib@1.2.3\" cannot be resolved.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27766","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"A silent error is thrown in `AddCommandModule.builder`, when passing a version to the command `ng add @my/lib@<version>`\" (#27766)"},{"Id":"2330016841","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T02:05:19","Actor":"leo6104","Number":"27764","RawContent":null,"Title":"The way to different path mapping between server and browser when using application builder ","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen i upgrade webpack builder to application builder, There is limits for server side rendering. \r\n\r\nI use `pdfjs-dist` which include `canvas.node` binding dependencies. \r\nIn browser serving & build process, `pdfjs-dist` can be bundled without errors.\r\nHowever, in server side, there is no `.node extension loader` so it raise `No loader is configured for \".node\" files: node_modules/canvas/build/Release/canvas.node`. \r\n\r\nPreviously, to avoid this problem with webpack builder, i just add `path mapping rule` in `tsconfig.server.json` only. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n \"paths\": {\r\n    \"pdfjs-dist\": [ \"../../mock/pdfjs.ts\" ],\r\n    ... \r\n },\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn @angular-devkit webpack or browser-esbuild, it is available to setup tsconfig for server side. \r\nIn @angular-devkit/build-angular:application, it is not available to add `tsconfig.server.json` so cannot use this kind of path mapping. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI saw 'webWorkerTsConfig' in `angular.json` schema. \r\n\r\nCan we add 'serverTsConfig' option like `webWorkerTsConfig`? \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27764","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The way to different path mapping between server and browser when using application builder \" (#27764)"},{"Id":"2329612814","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-02T15:29:14","Actor":"spc16670","Number":"27762","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unsupported URL Type \"workspace:\": workspace:*","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nother\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`npm i -D @angular-builders/jest`\r\n\r\nfails with \r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm ERR! code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL\r\nnpm ERR!

In earlier versions that used webpack, this issue was solved with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22629 (@dgp1130 , @alan-agius4 ). It had to do with excluding 'erroneous' modules that did not support downleveling, eg. whatwg-url.\r\nNow this exclusion list seems gone since esbuild uses different configuration. As a result app can not be loaded.\r\nAlso mentioning that while using native federation as well which has a custom esbuilder I think, same thing happens. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- git clone https://github.com/ZissisT/downlevel-angular-issue.git\r\n- cd downlevel-angular-issue\r\n- npm install\r\n- ng serve\r\n- Navigate to http://localhost:4200/\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nutils.js:34 \r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\r\n    at Function.getPrototypeOf (<anonymous>)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/lib/utils.js (utils.js:34:39)\r\n    at __require (chunk-4XRL6O37.js?v=c3c77883:41:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/lib/URL.js (URL.js:4:15)\r\n    at __require (chunk-4XRL6O37.js?v=c3c77883:41:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/webidl2js-wrapper.js (webidl2js-wrapper.js:3:13)\r\n    at __require (chunk-4XRL6O37.js?v=c3c77883:41:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/index.js (index.js:3:34)\r\n    at __require (chunk-4XRL6O37.js?v=c3c77883:41:50)\r\n    at index.js:27:46\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Downlevel exclusion list missing after upgrade to Angular 17\" (#27755)"},{"Id":"2323564592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-30T19:41:49","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27740","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(@angular/build): enable dependency prebundling for server dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nWith this commit, we introduce Vite dependencies prebundling for server bundles.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```\r\nng s\r\nBrowser bundles\r\nInitial chunk files     | Names               |  Raw size\r\npolyfills.js            | polyfills           |  90.87 kB\r\nmain.js                 | main                |  22.71 kB\r\nstyles.css              | styles              |  95 bytes\r\n\r\n                        | Initial total       | 113.67 kB\r\n\r\nServer bundles\r\nInitial chunk files     | Names               |  Raw size\r\nchunk-4EGJGG5L.mjs      | -                   |   1.80 MB\r\npolyfills.server.mjs    | polyfills.server    | 573.58 kB\r\nmain.server.mjs         | main.server         | 224.03 kB\r\nchunk-QDHZVCWX.mjs      | -                   |   2.57 kB\r\nrender-utils.server.mjs | render-utils.server | 423 bytes\r\n\r\nLazy chunk files        | Names               |  Raw size\r\nchunk-XD2MYPRT.mjs      | xhr2                |  40.04 kB\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation complete.

The use of the `isolatedModules` option ensures that TypeScript code can be safely transpiled without the need for the type-checker. This mode of operation has several advantages. The bundler (esbuild in this case) will know have knowledge of the TypeScript code constructs, such as enums, and can optimize the output code based on that knowledge including inlining both const and regular enums where possible. Additionally, this allows for the removal of the babel-based optimization passes for all TypeScript code. These passes are still present for all JavaScript code such as from third-party libraries/packages. These advantages lead to an improvement in build time, especially in production configurations. To ensure optimal output code size in this setup, the `useDefineForClassFields` TypeScript option should either be removed or set to `true` which enables ECMAScript standard compliant behavior.\r\n\r\nInitial testing reduced a warm production build of a newly generated project from ~2.3 seconds to ~2.0 seconds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27752","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(@angular/build): use direct transpilation with isolated modules\" (#27752)"},{"Id":"2325719292","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-30T13:56:36","Actor":"alvaro-b-enguidanos","Number":"27751","RawContent":null,"Title":"flag to run or skip all the optional migrations","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nupdate\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen running `ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18` a prompt appears  asking which migrations  would you like to run.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1131\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/29378422/96364862-b45d-4078-912f-5589423eb78b\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my company the migrations are executed through a CI system, so there are no human interaction.

The pre-built theme's accent and warn colors are applied correctly in those cases.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-g9u5la\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. **Create a new Angular project or use an existing one**:\r\n   - If creating a new project, run: `ng new color-theme-issue`\r\n   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd color-theme-issue`\r\n   \r\n2. **Install Angular Material 18**:\r\n   - Run: `ng add @angular/material`\r\n   - Choose custom theme\r\n\r\n3. **Define custom themes in a Sass file (e.g., styles.scss)**:\r\n   ```scss\r\n      @use \"@angular/material\" as mat;\r\n   \r\n      @include mat.core();\r\n\r\n       $theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n       (\r\n          color: (\r\n              theme-type: dark,\r\n              primary: mat.$violet-palette,\r\n                    ),\r\n    .                   ..\r\n             )\r\n         )\r\n\r\n     :root {\r\n         @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n         }\r\n\r\n4. **Use Angular Material components in your template**:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <button mat-flat-button>This should use the primary color</button>\r\n   <button mat-flat-button class=\"mat-button-accent\">This should use the accent color (not visible)</button>\r\n   <button mat-flat-button class=\"mat-button-warn\">This should use the warn color (not visible)</button>\r\n   ```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll colors defined in a custom theme should be applied correctly to the Angular Material components, just like when using the pre-built themes from @angular/material/prebuilt-themes.\r\n\r\n![m3-colors-work](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/55688722/13cbd941-4ae3-4872-b79e-7431900f7de1)\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the primary color is reflected. The accent and warn colors are not visible in the components.\r\n\r\n![m3-colors-bug](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/55688722/eea56f02-1834-485a-8537-5f41d22bb1bc)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29160","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material 18 (Material 3) Custom Theme: Only Primary Color Applies \" (#29160)"},{"Id":"2327875850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T19:44:38","Actor":"admin-pilotds","Number":"29163","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(M3 mat-card): Elevated card uses the wrong surface color","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nMDC M3 specification (https://m3.material.io/components/cards/specs) dictates that enabled elevated card container color should be **md.sys.color.surface-container-low**\r\n\r\nHowever, in @material/tokens/v0_161/_md-comp-elevated-card.scss we have\r\n\r\n...\r\n'container-color': map.get($deps, 'md-sys-color', 'surface'),\r\n...\r\n\r\nShould be changed to\r\n\r\n'container-color': map.get($deps, 'md-sys-color', 'surface-container-low'),\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nNo need for reproduction -- this is clearly not according to specification.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAn elevated card with 'surface-container-low' background\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAn elevated card with 'surface' background\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29163","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(M3 mat-card): Elevated card uses the wrong surface color\" (#29163)"},{"Id":"2331895616","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T19:36:28","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29180","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/snack-bar): fix overrides mixin name typo","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #29172","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29180","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/snack-bar): fix overrides mixin name typo\" (#29180)"},{"Id":"2331739343","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T18:00:55","Actor":"atscott","Number":"29176","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/testing): TestbedHarnessEnvironment should work when Zone is …","State":"open","Body":"…not present\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the harness environment which assumes Zone is always defined on the page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29176","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/testing): TestbedHarnessEnvironment should work when Zone is …\" (#29176)"},{"Id":"2330435893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T16:24:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29171","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): theming API migration not working with CRLF line endings","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the migration didn't account for CRLF line endings when figuring out the Sass namespace.\r\n\r\nFixes #29147.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29171","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/schematics): theming API migration not working with CRLF line endings\" (#29171)"},{"Id":"2329517245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T16:24:27","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29168","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/table): simplify structural styles","State":"closed","Body":"Simplifies the table's structural styles to make them smaller and easier to maintain.

Immediately after creation, the ripple state is set to `RippleState.FADING_IN` ([source](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/core/ripple/ripple-renderer.ts#L184)). However, the actual `FADING_IN` transition does not occur because the button is removed from the DOM.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nModify the code at line 184 to set the state to `RippleState.VISIBLE`, and then set it to `RippleState.FADING_IN` on the `transitionstart` event. This way, the ripple will be removed here:\r\n[Remove Ripple](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/core/ripple/ripple-renderer.ts#L414)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n-

In this site, I used `mat.define-theme` to create a theme using the `$violet-palette` and everything was working well, except the chip component carried the same style from M2.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of researching, I found that my `angular.json` file includes `prebuilt-themes/ indigo-pink.css` in `styles`, which based on #28779, appears to not have been updated for M3. Switching my import statement to `prebuilt-themes/magenta-violet.css` fixed the issue, and now `mat-chip` has the correct styling.\r\n\r\nI may have just been approaching fixing the problem incorrectly (or perhaps my styling setup is not correct), but I think that mentioning which prebuilt themes work for M3 somewhere in the documentation would be extremely helpful, especially for those upgrading their site to Angular Material v18 from an older version, or for someone starting out!\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-theme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29152","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Mention Importing Prebuilt Themes for M3 Support\" (#29152)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-06-04T03:30:02.8170597Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1598}

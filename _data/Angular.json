I think this update tool has worked for me in the past but most of the time I just \"rebase\" my code onto a new project. I'm used to spring boot where to get everything updated I have to copy/paste one or two versions belonging to \"bom\" bill of material dependencies that set the version for everything else transitively. When I run `ng update` or `npm audit fix --force` what is it trying to do? Every time I read an error from one of these things I feel like I need a visual aid to figure out which version is too far up or down from where the other versions want them to be.\r\n`ng update` proposed that everything be set to 13.3.6/13.3.5. That sounded good. How is 14.0.0-next.16 entering the picture? I certainly didn't add it. Is there a full proof guide for everything I need to do to update things and make the vulnerabilities go away?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23102","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng update says there are incompatible peer dependencies\" (#23102)"},{"Id":"1228863464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-08T11:29:11","Actor":"sixcorners","Number":"23101","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update says it checked package.json but it seems that can be misleading","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> no\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> ng update says that it checked package.json but if you take an old project, update the dependencies, npm install, then go back to the old package.json versions it will say that all the versions are fine.

By way of example here are some screenshots, taken from the same browser just my page versus angular page: Note the \"+1\" in the screenshot is a <mat-mini-fab> but renders larger than the <mat-fab> shown on your website.\r\nSimilar issues with other controls: (\"Binding Type\" is in a  <mat-card-title> element and the text below is <mat-card-subtitle> -- compare to screenshot taken from the material website of a mat card with a title and subtitle.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 2 13 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846394-62349276-4988-4c1c-b8d8-93e8dde88cbe.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846597-28ff5250-352a-446e-9ad1-397d2e8f34ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nNo idea how to approach this.  Fiddling with css directly seems like the wrong approach, as changing height/width of buttons doesn't shrink text. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot for size comparison from your <mat-card> examples with a title and subtitle.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166857688-8995e0c9-028a-45a0-9746-01b63584eef7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.3\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24879","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Componets are all too big relative to angular.material.io\" (#24879)"},{"Id":"1226006078","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-04T22:27:17","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"24877","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v14.1.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the feature-freeze phase.

This greatly limits and even blocks some Angular applications.\r\n\r\nThere are timeswhen the actual index file of the app is hosted on a separate domain. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGiven the following criteria: \r\n* The build Angular app's assets are uploaded to a **cdn**. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/<contents-of-the-dist-folder>`\r\n* The `index.html` file of the app is then **\"deployed\"** to a separate domain. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/index.html` is moved to `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/index.html`\r\n\r\nThe combined use of `--deployUrl` and `--baseHref` gives Angular apps the ability to do this. \r\n\r\nHowever, this cannot be accomplished with _only using_ the `--baseHref` option. The two outcomes:\r\n1. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **cdn** (ie. `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/...`)\r\n    * assets are able to load\r\n    * route _throws an error_ and does not load the app (see error below)\r\n2. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **\"deployed\"** domain (ie. `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/`)\r\n    * assets _cannot load_ because they are not uploaded to **deployed** domain\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a minimum reproduction repo. It has a detailed README with setup and testing instructions. It also adds a little more context and clarity around the difference between a **cdn** url and the **deployed** url. \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/djhouseknecht/angular-deploy-url-repro\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Unhandled Navigation Error: SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'http://localhost:8080/fake-cdn/#/' cannot be created in a document with origin 'http://localhost:4200' and URL 'http://localhost:4200/thor/'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n> Error is taken from the mini repo above\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nExtra relevant information in the minimum repo.

As you know it is non trivial to resize the elements, is there any way to apply some setting to make things the same size as on the angular material website?  By way of example here are some screenshots, taken from the same browser just my page versus angular page: Note the \"+1\" in the screenshot is a <mat-mini-fab> but renders larger than the <mat-fab> shown on your website.\r\nSimilar issues with other controls: (\"Binding Type\" is in a  <mat-card-title> element and the text below is <mat-card-subtitle> -- compare to screenshot taken from the material website of a mat card with a title and subtitle.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 2 13 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846394-62349276-4988-4c1c-b8d8-93e8dde88cbe.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166846597-28ff5250-352a-446e-9ad1-397d2e8f34ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nNo idea how to approach this.  Fiddling with css directly seems like the wrong approach, as changing height/width of buttons doesn't shrink text. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot for size comparison from your <mat-card> examples with a title and subtitle.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/166857688-8995e0c9-028a-45a0-9746-01b63584eef7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.3\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24879","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Componets are all too big relative to angular.material.io\" (#24879)"},{"Id":"1226006078","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-04T22:27:17","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"24877","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v14.1.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the feature-freeze phase.

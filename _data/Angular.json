([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n                ╵                 ^\n\n    These parenthesized literals followed by a colon look like the start of an arrow function expression followed by a TypeScript return type (e.g. `([]) : 1` could be the start of the TypeScript arrow function `([]): 1 => 1`). Unlike in JavaScript, parsing arrow functions in TypeScript requires backtracking. In this case esbuild correctly determined that this expression wasn't an arrow function after all but the check for destructuring was incorrectly not covered under the backtracking process. With this release, the error message is now only reported if the parser successfully parses an arrow function without backtracking.\n\n-   Fix generated TypeScript `enum` comments containing `*/` ([#&#8203;2369](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2369), [#&#8203;2371](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2371))\n\n    TypeScript `enum` values that are equal to a number or string literal are inlined (references to the enum are replaced with the literal value) and have a `/* ... */` comment after them with the original enum name to improve readability. However, this comment is omitted if the enum name contains the character sequence `*/` because that would end the comment early and cause a syntax error:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript\n    enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Generated JavaScript\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This was originally handled correctly when TypeScript `enum` inlining was initially implemented since it was only supported within a single file. However, when esbuild was later extended to support TypeScript `enum` inlining across files, this special case where the enum name contains `*/` was not handled in that new code. Starting with this release, esbuild will now handle enums with names containing `*/` correctly when they are inlined across files:\n\n    ```ts\n    // foo.ts\n    export enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n\n    // bar.ts\n    import { Foo } from './foo'\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2 /* */ */);\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Allow `declare` class fields to be initialized ([#&#8203;2380](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2380))\n\n    This release fixes an oversight in the TypeScript parser that disallowed initializers for `declare` class fields. TypeScript actually allows the following limited initializer expressions for `readonly` fields:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare const enum a { b = 0 }\n\n    class Foo {\n      // These are allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly a = 0\n      declare readonly b = -0\n      declare readonly c = 0n\n      declare readonly d = -0n\n      declare readonly e = 'x'\n      declare readonly f = `x`\n      declare readonly g = a.b\n      declare readonly h = a['b']\n\n      // These are not allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly x = (0)\n      declare readonly y = null\n      declare readonly z = -a.b\n    }\n    ```\n\n    So with this release, esbuild now allows initializers for `declare` class fields too. To future-proof this in case TypeScript allows more expressions as initializers in the future (such as `null`), esbuild will allow any expression as an initializer and will leave the specifics of TypeScript's special-casing here to the TypeScript type checker.\n\n-   Fix a bug in esbuild's feature compatibility table generator ([#&#8203;2365](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2365))\n\n    Passing specific JavaScript engines to esbuild's `--target` flag restricts esbuild to only using JavaScript features that are supported on those engines in the output files that esbuild generates. The data for this feature is automatically derived from this compatibility table with a script: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/.\n\n    However, the script had a bug that could incorrectly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be supported in a given engine even when it doesn't actually work in that engine. Specifically this bug happened when a certain aspect of JavaScript syntax has always worked incorrectly in that engine and the bug in that engine has never been fixed. This situation hasn't really come up before because previously esbuild pretty much only targeted JavaScript engines that always fix their bugs, but the two new JavaScript engines that were added in the previous release ([Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) and [Rhino](https://togithub.com/mozilla/rhino)) have many aspects of the JavaScript specification that have never been implemented, and may never be implemented. For example, the `let` and `const` keywords are not implemented correctly in those engines.\n\n    With this release, esbuild's compatibility table generator script has been fixed and as a result, esbuild will now correctly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be unsupported in a given engine if there is some aspect of that syntax that is broken in all known versions of that engine. This means that the following JavaScript syntax features are no longer considered to be supported by these engines (represented using esbuild's internal names for these syntax features):\n\n    Hermes:\n\n    -   `arrow`\n    -   `const-and-let`\n    -   `default-argument`\n    -   `generator`\n    -   `optional-catch-binding`\n    -   `optional-chain`\n    -   `rest-argument`\n    -   `template-literal`\n\n    Rhino:\n\n    -   `arrow`\n    -   `const-and-let`\n    -   `destructuring`\n    -   `for-of`\n    -   `generator`\n    -   `object-extensions`\n    -   `template-literal`\n\n    IE:\n\n    -   `const-and-let`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The situation is the following: we make a build and deploy it, some customers use the website and in this process cache the JS files. We make some changes to the codebase and then one week later we make another build and deploy it. One of the JS files in the new bundle has the same content hash (and file name) but a different intergrity hash. This leads to customers complaining about bugs, because the browser still has the file cached from the old build, but since the integrity hash is different (and we don't cache the `index.html` file) the integrity check fails as the cached JS file from the old build is hashed against the integrity hash from the new build, which causes the browser to block the JS file.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we can't reproduce this behavior, when we try to locally build the same commit hashes that were deployed, the contents of the JS files of the two builds are identical. In the last case the JS file from the old build always included an exception variable in the catch blocks (`} catch (n) {`), while the new build omitted them (`} catch {`) with everything else being equal (we also didn't change any dependencies or configuration). Since we can't reproduce it I can't open a bug for this, but this is a big issue for us.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `outputHashing` can only be configured to generate a content hash. If it was possible to configure `outputHashing` to always create unique file names on every build, while it would not fix the underlying issue, it would resolve the problem, since when deploying a new build we could be sure the browsers would not already have a cached file with the same name and the file would not be blocked from execution as the integrity check wouldn't fail.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd another configuration option next to `outputHashing` which would allow to define whether the file names generated as part of `outputHashing` should be based on the file content (current behavior, default) or be unique with each build (new).\r\n\r\nTo ensure the file names are unique per build, one option would be adding an epoch timestamp to the filenames, either in replacement of the content hashes or additional to them. So the file names would look something like this `main.1657103379.js` or `main.eaf4225277726a91.1657103379.js`. Another option would be to include an epoch timestamp / randomness when calculating the content hash.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be fixing the underlying issue, as that would also fix the problem. But as I mentioned the issue is not reproducible and very sporadic. Seeing there are quite a lot of issues already here on this topic but no one so far has been able to make it reproducible I don't think it's likely this is a viable solution, unless someone from reading the issue description of the differently written catch clauses knows what the issue is.\r\n\r\nA workaround would be for us to do the same as described in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10641#issuecomment-517290830 to add a post build script which would manually transform the file names to include the timestamp. But this would be quite a brittle solution, as it could break at any point, should Angular introduce changes in the way the files are built or named.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23510","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unique content hash per build\" (#23510)"},{"Id":"1295491355","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T09:41:03","Actor":"Srikor","Number":"23509","RawContent":null,"Title":"--base-href does not modify the path of script files in index.html","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nPer angular documents for ng build command, deployUrl is deprecated and  the --base-href option should be used.

Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The stackblitz is very very hard to read. There is one .ts file with 2 components and 3 classes, and one of the components in the file references a separate template file with a completely different name. Why not just use another file altogether for the .ts and use the same name as the template?\r\n- The accessibility section briefly mentions things like setDescribedByIds(), but the actual implementation doesn't even use many things mentioned (and when I tried to use the exact example, was met with many errors I couldn't get past).\r\n- accommodate strict typescript settings, which many people use/are forced to use at work. I ran into many problems with this. Many @Inputs needed to be initialized, and I wasn't sure if I should just use the safe navigation or non-null assertion operators. I think the official documentation should be using the strictest forms of typechecking/null checking instead of the many \"any\" types that are so often used (not in this guide, but elsewhere in angular docs). It would make things much easier, and also stop teaching so people bad habits.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Custom Form Field Control documentation is very confusing and hard to read\" (#25244)"},{"Id":"1299592034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-09T07:02:15","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25243","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): prevent outside clicks from going to other overlays","State":"open","Body":"Adds a subscription to the outside click stream of the autocomplete overlay so that the events don't propagate to other overlays which may close the autocomplete prematurely.\r\n\r\nFixes #25238.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25243","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): prevent outside clicks from going to other overlays\" (#25243)"},{"Id":"1298598476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-09T06:27:57","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25241","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: attempt to de-flake harness integration test","State":"closed","Body":"Tries to de-flake the harness e2e integration test by swapping out `mat-select` with `mat-selection-list`. `mat-select` has been causing flakes in its own Firefox tests too so it's possible that it may be the reason for the integration test flakes as well.\r\n\r\nThe component being tested doesn't really matter since the integration test is primarily verifying our npm packages.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25241","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: attempt to de-flake harness integration test\" (#25241)"},{"Id":"1299404423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-08T20:06:45","Actor":"michaelfaith","Number":"25242","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(schematics): ng-add prebuilt styles config isn't compatible with yarn pnp","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe current implementation of `ng-add` adds an entry to the `angular.json` styles array for whichever prebuilt style was selected, and that entry is a relative path involving `node_modules`, which doesn't work with yarn pnp.  \r\n\r\nPer [this](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16980#issuecomment-1179295109) discussion, styles added to an application's `angular.json` work with module resolution, but not with styles exported via package `exports`, which is the case for the prebuilt styles.  \r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```json\r\n\"./prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\": {\r\n  \"style\": \"./prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what can be done to adjust this right now, until the module resolution for `angular.json` will work with package `exports`, (unless you think adding the style import to the `styles.css/scss` is preferable. I personally don't think it is).  But once it does support `exports`, I believe the styles path in https://github.com/angular/components/blob/b5c935ad3f187e86aa0748cb439e793edd8b37cb/src/material/schematics/ng-add/theming/theming.ts#L111 will need to be adjusted to something like `\"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\"`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNg Add should create a configuration that is compatible with yarn pnp\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt doesn't currently.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.0.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25242","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(schematics): ng-add prebuilt styles config isn't compatible with yarn pnp\" (#25242)"},{"Id":"1297960520","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T22:48:22","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25240","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add tooltip example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25240","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add tooltip example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25240)"},{"Id":"1297926676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T19:10:36","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25239","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add tabs example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25239","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add tabs example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25239)"},{"Id":"1296423082","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T15:42:31","Actor":"UltimateGemini","Number":"25235","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to set mutli-colored circles on google map?","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to set different colors for circles on map using the options attribute but it's not working.\r\n\r\nI'm using a function to set the circle options for each item in a observable array:\r\n```\r\nsetCircle() {\r\n   this.service.circles$.subscribe((res) => {\r\n      res.forEach((x) => {\r\n        this.circleOptions = {\r\n          strokeColor: x.color,\r\n          strokeOpacity: 1,\r\n          strokeWeight: 1,\r\n          fillColor: x.color,\r\n          fillOpacity: 0.2\r\n        };\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circles show but they all show 1 color and not the color value for each different item.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the documentation provided: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/polygon#Circle\r\n\r\nand it seems the only way to set the fillColor is through the options. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this issue?

A common solution is to use a library like momentjs or dayjs or write our own adapter, but if we want to continue using native dates the best way is to just extend the `NativeDateAdapter` and override its `parse` method with a more sophisticated implementation. The problem is that we cannot just extend the `NativeDateAdapter` since the `parse` method signature narrows down the arguments from `value: any, parseFormat: any` to just `value: any` because the current implementation does not honor the `parseFormat`. This is suboptimal since I want to use the `parseFormat` when overriding the implementation and I do not want to extend `DateAdapter` directly. This would cause a lot of overhead.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I overlooked something and there may be a better way to achieve what I want.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix: making the parse format available for native date adapter extension\" (#25226)"},{"Id":"1296249081","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T19:04:23","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"25234","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/progress-bar): Switch progress-bar implementation to use MDC","State":"open","Body":"Old implementation is still available under @angular/material/legacy-progress-bar\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n- DOM and CSS classes for mat-progress-bar have changes\r\n- Typescript API is largely the same but may have minor differences\r\n- See the MDC migration guide for more information about the changes and\r\n  how to migrate your app (TODO: link when available)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25234","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/progress-bar): Switch progress-bar implementation to use MDC\" (#25234)"},{"Id":"1294893387","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T16:57:09","Actor":"oliverkierepka","Number":"25230","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Fix two links in CONTRIBUTING.md","State":"closed","Body":"In CONTRIBUTING.md there are two broken links:\r\n1)  `full list` that should point to the renamed `commit-message.mts` file\r\n2) `gitter` that probably should point to `https://gitter.im/angular/material2`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25230","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: Fix two links in CONTRIBUTING.md\" (#25230)"},{"Id":"1295809059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T13:00:44","Actor":"richardsengers","Number":"25233","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(SELECT): You have to click twice when select is open","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSo when you have a select which is openend and you have a button next to it, you cannot click the button.

I'm workin on.\r\nThis is a regression since version 13.\r\n\r\nI think the best will be if you can give to the tooltip directive a new input which keep the tooltip open in case cursor is move toward

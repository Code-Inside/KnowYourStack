The trouble arises when an error panel overlaps with the text input, hindering the visibility and editing of the code.\r\n\r\nThis overlap creates a cumbersome user experience and makes it challenging to identify and correct errors. To improve the usability, I'd like to suggest two potential solutions:\r\n\r\nDisplay the error directly under the mouse, similar to how TypeScript errors are handled. This would avoid any overlap with the code and enable the user to see the error without obstructing the code view.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the error panel could be placed on the side of the IDE. This would keep the coding area clear and allow for easier access to error details.\r\n\r\nPlease look into this issue to enhance the error handling experience and the overall useability of the IDE.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n*ISSUE*\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6935240/b8ad1dfd-c796-4245-98f2-b43d19babc12)\r\n\r\n*RECOMMENDATION 1 - Under the mouse* \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6935240/e2d74429-2f3b-4331-8c59-25e2ad3253ad)\r\n\r\n*RECOMMENDATION 2 - To the side*\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6935240/4b587bcd-0ab7-4928-819e-f9983cb7b7f1)\r\n\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52760","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-infra: fix IDE error panel visibility\" (#52760)"},{"Id":"1986516784","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-09T22:36:38","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"52759","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump DevTools version to 1.0.8","State":"open","Body":"This release actually happened yesterday, I just forgot to merge the version bump.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52759","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"release: bump DevTools version to 1.0.8\" (#52759)"},{"Id":"1986506894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-09T22:29:03","Actor":"AppleLAN","Number":"52758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image tutorial example not working with provideImgixLoader without extra configuration","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nI found an issue in the NgOptimizedImage example when using provideImgixLoader.

in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n16.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn our applications, we have built CSS for the MDC components without applying an MDC theme. We include mat.core(), and we build on that. It seems that in v17, the base non-themed CSS for many (all?) components, as defined in the published .mjs files, no longer include fallback values for when the --mdc* variables are not defined. Take slider for example. Here is a rule published in 16.x as part of slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape, 50%); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn v17, there is no fallback value in slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am guessing this change was intentional, but not having those fallback values is breaking the styling of our applications. For example, given the lack of the above fallback, the slider thumb knob is no longer rounded How can we get the default values present in 16.x to be present in 17? Is there some way to set the variables to their defaults?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-cawym5\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Include only mat.core() in the application's CSS\r\n2.

These services offer limited flexibility, especially for SSR-focused applications where managing tags like `<link>` or dynamic metadata updates is crucial. Currently, <ins>**there is no clean way to create `<link>` tags in SSR context**</ins> that are hydrated, defined at the component level, and integrated with Angular’s lifecycle. A new, declarative component e.g. `<ng-head>` would enhance the developer experience by providing a more intuitive and comprehensive way to handle metadata and head elements in an Angular project.\n\nWhile it is possible to create a custom library to address this problem, it feels like this functionality should be available out of the box in Angular. Features like adding `<link>` tags to the header or automatically handling title and meta tags (adding and removing them when a component is created or destroyed) should not require writing a custom service to manage. Having these capabilities natively would greatly enhance Angular’s usability in SSR contexts and make metadata management simpler and more consistent.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```html\n<ng-head>\n  <title>Example</title>\n  <meta name=\"description\" [attr.content]=\"example$ | async\" /> <!-- with observables -->\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" [attr.href]=\"example()\" /> <!-- or with signals -->\n</ng-head>\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile a new service for head management supporting [all elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head#see_also) could be an option, I personally don’t find this approach ideal.\n\n\n### Current approaches \nCurrently, I'm aware of two indirect approaches to achieve this, both of which feel very developer-unfriendly:\n\n1. **Creating a Service**: A custom service can be created that listens to `RouterEvents`, loading metadata from the `data` property on the route and handling automatic removal. This approach requires custom event handling and can become complex to maintain.\n   \n2. **Managing Metadata in Each Component**: Another method is to add and remove meta tags directly within each component, using `ngOnInit` to add tags and `ngOnDestroy` to remove them. This requires repetitive code in each component and increases the risk of metadata inconsistencies.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Native Component for Dynamic Metadata in Angular – Essential for SSR in SEO context\" (#58377)"},{"Id":"2615671384","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T08:53:46","Actor":"vinuvatassery","Number":"58376","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content security policy Issue for ZAP scan with -unsafe-inline' option","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-browser\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn my application, I am configuring the Content Security Policy for script-src and style-src.

The resolver fetches data asynchronously from an API and then tries to set the page title based on this data, but it’s not working as expected. This issue only occurs when running the production build on a Node server. Everything seems to work fine when using ng serve.\n\nI tried setting a static title in the resolver to test the behavior, and the static title does appear. However, when I attempt to set the title after the asynchronous API call, it doesn’t update. The title set before the asynchronous access reflects correctly, but any title updates after the asynchronous processing are not reflected.\n\nconst day_ymd = route.paramMap.get('day_ymd');\n\n title.setTitle(day_ymd ); <-- works fine\n const data = await displayService.race_program_all2();\n\n\n const data = await displayService.race_program_all2();\n title.setTitle(day_ymd ); <-- title do not set\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 22.9.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.3\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                              Version\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect            0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular        18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core                 18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics           18.2.10\n@angular/cdk                         18.2.10\n@angular/cli                         18.2.10\n@angular/material                    18.2.10\n@angular/material-date-fns-adapter   18.2.10\n@angular/material-moment-adapter     18.2.10\n@angular/pwa                         18.2.10\n@angular/ssr                         18.2.10\n@schematics/angular                  18.2.10\nng-packagr                           18.2.1\nrxjs                                 7.8.1\ntypescript                           5.5.4\nzone.js                              0.14.10\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"resolver function cannot set page title with asynchronous data fetch\" (#58374)"},{"Id":"2615464823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T02:35:54","Actor":"karthikuncc","Number":"58373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added any","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [x] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

With the prior implementation, a change of the `request` will queue the effect, but the state remains unchanged until the effect actually runs. For a brief period, the resource is in a state where the request has changed, but the state has yet to update.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic if we want to use resources in certain contexts where we care about the state of the resource in a synchronous way. For example, an async validator backed by a resource might be checked after an update:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue.set(123);\r\n\r\nif (validator.value()) {\r\n  // value is still valid, even though the resource is dirty and will soon flip\r\n  // to loading state (returning value(): undefined) while revalidating.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo address this timing concern, `linkedSignal()` is used within the `resource()` now to to synchronously transition the state in response to the request changing. This ensures any followup reads see a consistent view of the resource regardless of whether the effect has run.\r\n\r\nThis also addresses a race condition where `.set()` behaves differently on a `resource()` depending on whether or not the effect has run.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58372","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): port resource() to linkedSignal()\" (#58372)"},{"Id":"2615152859","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T21:35:28","Actor":"szeinedd-nrel","Number":"58371","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing documentation for FormControl","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe documentation page for `FormControl` is essentially blank.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControl\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nSomething akin to https://v17.angular.io/api/forms/FormControl","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58371","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing documentation for FormControl\" (#58371)"},{"Id":"2614579908","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T21:17:43","Actor":"Rutaer","Number":"58364","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signals?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDear Angular Team.

Initially, the SSR-generated HTML renders correctly:\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f234271e-952b-4fb7-932f-9564700ff104)\n\n2. Then, for a brief moment, both elements appear visible:\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d8f291-9f39-49e6-ab5c-bf33c001c2af)\n\n3. Once hydration completes, the server-rendered element disappears:\n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60a33d1-2f52-4c3e-a46e-d3c7f71ba59e)\n\nThe more lazy components there are, the longer hydration takes, leading to both elements being visible simultaneously. This issue occurs even if the conditions are outside the `<router-outlet>` and in the `AppComponent` itself.\n\nAfter trying various approaches, here are my observations:\n\n1. Using:\n   - `@if(isBrowser) {};` + `@if(!isBrowser) {};`\n   - `*ngIf=\"isBrowser\"` + `*ngIf=\"!isBrowser\"`\n   - `@if(isBrowser) {} @else {}`  \n   all cause this issue.\n\n2. Using:\n   - `*ngIf=\"isBrowser; else servTpl\"` + `<ng-template #servTpl>`  \n   **does not** cause the issue.\n\nDisabling hydration or using eager routes also prevents the issue.\n\nWhen testing a reproduction repository, I suggest throttling the CPU and network to better observe the issue.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/jakubsobel/angular-hydration-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 20.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.10\n@angular/cli                    18.2.10\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.10\n@schematics/angular             18.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58354","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Server-only content removed to late when lazy route is used with hydration enabled\" (#58354)"},{"Id":"2613094730","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T05:33:08","Actor":"sheikalthaf","Number":"58353","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone migration making standalone: true to standalone: false","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI tried to update to next version of Angular and migration marks all the components standalone: false (note: all my components are standalone).\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d388674a-441d-413b-8b8f-1e9cce105185)\n\nI upgrade from Angular 19.0.0-next.10 -> 19.0.0-next.11\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0-next.13\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.8.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0-next.11\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0-next.13\n@angular/build                  19.0.0-next.13\n@angular/cdk                    18.1.1\n@angular/cli                    19.0.0-next.13\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.0-next.13\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0-next.13\nng-packagr                      19.0.0-next.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58353","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Standalone migration making standalone: true to standalone: false\" (#58353)"},{"Id":"2613093444","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T05:10:47","Actor":"kw-pro","Number":"58352","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(forms): Correct Comment at FormControl Constructor","State":"open","Body":"## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.0.0-next.9\n\n### Description\n\nOOTB Angular 19.0.0-next.13 app triggers prerendering when `prerender` property is set to `false` in `angular.json` as well as when parameter `--prerender=false` is passed to the `build` command.\n\nPrerendering is triggered even after removing `app.server.routes.ts` which by default sets `renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender` for routes.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- create new Angular 19.0.0-next.13 app with SSR/SSG\n- in OOTB app, inside `angular.json`, add `\"prerender\": false` to `architecture` -> `build` -> `options` object\n- run `npm run build`\n- in console, verify if any static route is prerendered\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a17a313-e04a-4923-8e16-b109560e531c)\n- in `dist/<your_app>` location, verify if `prerendered-routes.json` is generated\n- discard changes from the `angular.json` file\n- run `npm run build -- --prerender=false`\n- follow previous steps to verify that perrendering was triggered\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n###

The applications will be kept in step with each other in terms of versions. \nMy first attempt at doing this involved having a common library and two applications in the same workspace, but I really want separation of code, I don't want code from one application getting into the other or the common library, I also want to avoid the appearance of that via Visual Studio intellisense\n\nThe second attempt was to have a workspace per app and one for the common library. That worked better as now Visual Studio doesn't show paths from one App in the other. I use \"npm install \"file://...\" to create a link between the two. The version number won't change, it won't be published\n\nThe problem here was that I have to switch off angular caching as otherwise changes in the common library weren't getting built into the application\n\nUltimately I just want a solution that is as simple as what you would do in C#, have 3 standalone projects with explicit references between them\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA solution that would work for me would be a flag that disabled caching for individual npm file link packages, I suspect there are better answers though\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPutting the 2 apps and common code in the same workspace.

first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nNot certain, just started using Angular Material, so no experience with previous versions.\n\n### Description\n\nI have been working with Angular Material tree version 18.2.10.\nI am mocking my code after the  Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\" on the Angular Material website:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nMy code matches their code exactly but if the very first top level tree node has no children but other tree nodes have children then the children get duplicated and appear as lop level nodes.\nI verified this from the example link above which has a button to open it up on StackBlitz and I am able to change the array used for the tree slightly which replicates the issue. \n\nFor instance this is the datasource used in the example linked above.  In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"},{"Id":"2615017503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T20:11:50","Actor":"FlorinCiocirlan","Number":"29926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in function comment","State":"open","Body":"There is a typo in file _**[components](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main)/[src](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src)/[cdk](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk)/[schematics](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics)/[update-tool](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics/update-tool)/index.ts**_\n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_form_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */\n\nshould be \n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_from_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typo in function comment\" (#29926)"},{"Id":"2614399233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T15:16:29","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29925","RawContent":null,"Title":"merge material.angular.io repo","State":"open","Body":"Used git-filter-repo to rewrite history, so commits appear to have always been beneath the `material.angular.io` folder.\r\n\r\nFollows https://blog.aspect.build/otherrepo-to-monorepo\r\n\r\nNote, this MUST be a merge commit so care should be taken when merging to prevent squashing the history and losing the git blame layer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29925","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"merge material.angular.io repo\" (#29925)"},{"Id":"2613273783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T07:03:29","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29924","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): remove CommonModule imports","State":"open","Body":"Removes all the imports of `CommonModule` from the individual components since it isn't being used anywhere.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29924","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): remove CommonModule imports\" (#29924)"},{"Id":"2613213774","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T06:31:01","Actor":"caleniuc","Number":"29923","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAnchor): aria-disabled not applied with disabledInteractive","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`MAT_ANCHOR_HOST` applies `aria-disabled` differently than `MAT_BUTTON_HOST`.

This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\nThis phenomenon only occurs on the FIRST click post-column-add, and only if you include the 2nd (sub)header in your table definition, i.e. commenting out `<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>` mitigates the bug.\n\n# Possible root cause of the bug\n\nI think this is happening because Angular somehow rerenders the subheader as a result of dirty-checking the header, but does not update its internal records of the subheader's state in the process. Clicking the button causes the table to re-check its subheader's columns, at which point its differ discovers it hasn't officially added the newest column to the list (although it is already visually displaying the newest column).\n\nThis bug disappears if I modify `CdkTable._renderUpdatedColumns` in the following manner at [angular/components/src/cdk/table/table.ts:1087](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L1087):\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => \n    acc || !!def.getColumnsDiff();\n```\n\nFixed code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => {\n    const diff = def.getColumnsDiff();\n    return acc || !!diff;\n  };\n```\n    \nI think that the lazy computation of `def.getColumnsDiff()` is causing the subheader state not to get updated.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nThere is no exception. The error is that, when the user clicks their first button on a table header, all the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating each `<th mat-header-cell>` element and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"xokrrnnaegq.angular\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.4.0\",\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.6.4\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.8.29\",\n    \"hammerjs\": \"2.0.8\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"angular-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.5.4\",\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^18.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.10.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~7.0.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.8\",\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\n    \"karma\": \"~3.0.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.2\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"protractor\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.11.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.1.1\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers\" (#29922)"},{"Id":"2611853158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T14:52:14","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29920","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): remove unused motion system vars","State":"open","Body":"None of our components use these 36 motion variables and it takes up quite a bit of space in the styles","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29920","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): remove unused motion system vars\" (#29920)"},{"Id":"2610922876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T09:00:28","Actor":"azimuthdeveloper","Number":"29919","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(treeview): Add guide on how to migrate from old treeview to new treeview","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the sudden deprecation of the various tree controllers, it would be nice if there were some kind of documentation on how to remove tree controller and migrate to the new way of doing things.

Initially, I assumed this was a personal issue, but several team members have reported the same experience.\n\nUpon reviewing the CSS code, I found that the backdrop color is [set to a single value](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/5ad133d07341fa8647e81277e7f1b9f54b15059a/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L9), regardless of the theme. Currently, it's a faded black, which works fine for light themes but leads to poor contrast in dark themes. This reduces the legibility of the dialog content, making it harder to distinguish between the page background and the overlay.\n\nIn previous Material 2 theling API, dark themes used a faded white backdrop, which provided better contrast and enhanced readability.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/specs and see that dialog example use a white backdrop on dark mode\n2. Go to https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview, select a dark theme and open dialog in any example\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0043da65-f28c-4cce-bb3a-dcb6bf0cf517)\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d542b0d-fcc4-423d-85a9-02f6cd61f411)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Chrome (latest)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu 24.10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29903","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): low contrast for dialog backdrop in dark theme\" (#29903)"},{"Id":"2602336016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T12:01:04","Actor":"simonkovtyk","Number":"29902","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference","State":"open","Body":"Hi there ...\r\n\r\nRecently, I made some own implementations to support multiple paletts for m3 and I orientated my code at the token generation here.\r\n\r\nI found out, that Angular Material is not using the right tokens for some color rules as described in the [offical Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460).\r\n\r\nHere is an overview:\r\n| Token                    | Hue (Angular Material) | Hue (Material spec)                      |\r\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\r\n| on-primary-container     | Primary 10             | Primary 30                               |\r\n| on-primary-fixed-variant | Primary 30             | Secondary 30 (from primary palette)      |\r\n| on-secondary-container   | Secondary 10           | Secondary 30                             |\r\n| on-tertiary-container    | Tertiary 10            | Tertiary 30                              |","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29902","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference\" (#29902)"},{"Id":"2599961927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T04:21:23","Actor":"K0n4ta13","Number":"29898","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added","State":"open","Body":"I add the README file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29898","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added\" (#29898)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-10-27T03:30:02.2588762Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1536}

This can happen, for example, if the signal is set during the lifecycle hook of a directive within the same template that reads the signal.\r\n\r\nThis can cause a few things to happen:\r\n\r\n* Straightforwardly, it can cause `ExpressionChanged` errors.\r\n* Surprisingly, it can cause an assertion within the `ReactiveLViewConsumer` to fail.\r\n* Very surprisingly, it can cause change detection for an `OnPush` component to stop working.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of these later behaviors is subtle, and is ultimately a desync between the reactive graph and the view tree's notion of \"dirty\" for a given view. This will be fixed with further work planned for change detection to handle such updates directly. Until then, this commit improves the DX through two changes:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism of \"committing\" `ReactiveLViewConsumer`s to a view is changed to use the `consumerOnSignalRead` hook from the reactive graph. This prevents the situation which required the assertion in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. A `console.warn` warning is added when a view is marked dirty via a signal while it's still executing.\r\n\r\nThe warning informs users that they're pushing data against the direction of change detection, risking `ExpressionChanged` or other issues. It's a warning and not an error because the check is overly broad and captures situations where the application would not actually break as a result, such as if a `computed` marked the template dirty but still returned the same value.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52234","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): replace assertion with more intentional error\" (#52234)"},{"Id":"1946016302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-16T20:15:13","Actor":"qmonmert","Number":"52233","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo","State":"open","Body":"Fix word: standalone\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'm putting a ticket here and officially with Heroku in hopes one of the two services in question understands what the issue is, and whether it's with their service (or more likely) with incorrect configuration on my end.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance -- first time using Angular Universal, and it's also my first time deploying to Heroku. Both seemed easy when I was testing them individually, but combining them for this project has been... aging.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate angular universal app and attempt to deploy it to Heroku using Heroku CLI.\r\n\r\nI build my projects, then deploy them to heroku. I do not add an explicit build step or package installation step within my `npm run start`, as I believe Heroku already handles these steps.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 20.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n\r\nWarning: The current version of Node (20.5.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n20.5.0 is the version of node that it installed for me.

It is still overflowing outside the button wrapper and causing UI issues being distorted\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 15.2.4\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n- Browser(s): chrome, firefox etc \r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.4\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, material\r\n... material-moment-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.4\r\n@angular/flex-layout            15.0.0-beta.42\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.4\r\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27941","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): bug(mat-menu/mat-icon-button/radio-button/checkbox): Unable to reduce ripple size\" (#27941)"},{"Id":"1945859655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-16T18:37:03","Actor":"esprehn","Number":"27949","RawContent":null,"Title":"Minor optimizations to button-base","State":"open","Body":"Use vararg version of classList.add which has been allowed since https://github.com/angular/components/commit/cac8359747582b1bd606344f95fa8ab017a8bd02\n\nalso don't use a loop to check the attribute, it's only ever a single thing.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27949","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Minor optimizations to button-base\" (#27949)"},{"Id":"1945546734","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-16T16:27:40","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"27948","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button): buttons in toolbars","State":"closed","Body":"* increase specificity of mat-toolbar overrides","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27948","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/button): buttons in toolbars\" (#27948)"},{"Id":"1945172116","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-16T13:02:15","Actor":"gintarasgraciovas","Number":"27947","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(chips): impossible to define max length of mat-chip-row","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have an issue while working with MatChipRow.

There is currently a rule like this in `expanion-panel`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.scss#L78\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since `expanion-panel` has `ViewEncapsulation.None`, Angular won't limit the rule's scope using `[_nghost]`/`[_ngcontent]` attribute selectors, *and* Angular will copy the rule into any `ShadowDom`-encapsulated components.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.ts#L82\r\n\r\n###### *This issue was first noted [in this comment](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/c12347cafb18e900d19f613ce91afcca970d66d1#commitcomment-99447256).*\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-bsuofa?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Observe the animation is janky.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that `expansion-panel` is responsible:\r\n1. Delete the `<mat-expansion-panel>` element (and its children) from `example-component.html`.\r\n2. Reload (to force Angular to clear unused component styles).\r\n3. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that the `[style]` selector is responsible:\r\n1. Right-click > Inspect Element on \"expanstion panel contents\".\r\n3. In DevTools, ensure that `<div class=\"mat-expansion-panel-body\">` is selected.\r\n4. (optionally) Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 10,001 elements and takes a long time.\r\n5. Close the expansion panel.\r\n6. In DevTools, edit the CSS selector `.mat-expansion-panel-content[style*=\"visibility: hidden\"] *` to remove `[style*=...]`\r\n7. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n8. (optionally)  Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 1 element and is very fast.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth regardless of if an expansion panel exists or what the expansion panel component does internally.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth only after modifying an expansion-panel-internal CSS rule.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 19.9.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@angular/material               16.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27946","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion-panel): `[style*=...]` attribute selector causes whole-page slowdown in Chromium\" (#27946)"},{"Id":"1943760330","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-15T07:12:42","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27945","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch kitchen sink to standalone","State":"open","Body":"Switches the kitchen sink to standalone which allows us to get rid of some unnecessary files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27945","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: switch kitchen sink to standalone\" (#27945)"},{"Id":"1942775277","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T23:30:23","Actor":"zarend","Number":"27944","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/a11y): add example of LiveAnnouncer inside dialog","State":"open","Body":"Update the live-announcer demo in the dev-app. Add an example of calling LiveAnnouncer inside of a Dialog.

This means, that once Angular v17 is out, one would be forced to use the mdc-based components only.\r\n\r\nWhile this might have been a reasonable choice for your team - also conforming to your update and deprecation policies - there are codebases out there (including ours) that haven't migrated to the new components yet.\r\nReasons for that are probably diverse, but one major reasons for us was the knowledge about your efforts on eventually offering a brand-new token-based theming API.\r\n\r\nWe work on a bigger enterprise grade application with a design system that's based on customized material components. Due to limited official support for customizations on the current theming API (as of v16 with legacy components) , we tend to override a lot of (global) component styles.\r\nWhile eagerly waiting for the new token-based theming API to evolve and stabilize, we hoped to have the chance to upgrade directly to this new theming API, component by component.\r\nWith the discontinued support of legacy components in v17 however, this is now impossible and our migration path to the mdc-based components is very steep (either high effort or high risk).\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI can only see 2 options for us to move forward right now:\r\n\r\n1. While staying on v16, migrate each legacy component to the new mdc-based ones, component by component. This will require us to integrate with a new but still not latest theming API of the mdc-components first. After that migration is completed we would upgrade to v17 and have to re-integrate with the latest theming API once more, resulting in doubled theme integration effort. (high effort)\r\n2. Upgrade to v17 and migrate to mdc-based components at the same time. This would require us to migrate all components at once, which would tremendously increase the risk of the migration. However, we would only need to integrate with the latest theming API once. (high risk)\r\n\r\nIs there maybe another scenario that I am missing?\r\n\r\nIn case there's really no other option than these two, which I both consider as \"not ideal\", I would kindly ask you to re-consider still supporting legacy components in v17!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27942","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(multiple): still support legacy components in v17\" (#27942)"},{"Id":"1940540831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-12T20:53:31","Actor":"gpaimla","Number":"27940","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/button): firefox renders weird lines on certain zooms","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI don't know if this is a components issue or browser issue but for some reason, lines are being rendered on top of material buttons that have the same color as a parent divs background color for example: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/14272566/a971d081-44f9-4cac-be1c-cba3b2738232\r\n\r\nTemporary fix is to set background: transparent on the parent div\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/g7dcqg?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbutton-overview-example.css\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1.

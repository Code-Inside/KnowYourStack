This can be a problem if the DOM node is retained in memory, because the `LView` has references to all of the child nodes of the view, as well as other internal data structures.\r\n\r\nPreviously we tried to resolve the issue by clearing the `__ngContext__` when a node is removed (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36011), but we decided not to proceeed, because it can slow down destruction due to a megamorphic write.\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to address the issue while reducing the performance impact by assigning a unique ID when an `LView` is created and adding it to `__ngContext__`. All active views are tracked in a map where their unique ID is used as the key. We don't need to worry about leaks within that map,  because `LView`s are an internal data structure and we have complete control over when they are  created and destroyed.\r\n\r\nFixes #41047.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41908","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(core): avoid storing LView in __ngContext__\" (#41908)"},{"Id":"871171245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T21:20:26","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"41882","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): handle multiple i18n attributes with expression bindings","State":"closed","Body":"When there are multiple attributes that are marked for i18n translation,\r\nwhich contain expression bindings, we were generating i18n update op-codes\r\nthat did not accurately map to the correct value to be bound in the lView.\r\nEach attribute's bindings were relative to the start of the lView first\r\nattributes values rather than to their own.\r\n\r\nThis fix passes the current binding index to `generateBindingUpdateOpCodes()`\r\nwhen processing i18n attributes to account for this.\r\n\r\nFixes #41869\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41882","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): handle multiple i18n attributes with expression bindings\" (#41882)"},{"Id":"872931758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T21:13:04","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"41901","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"perf(core): avoid storing LView in __ngContext__ (#41358)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 18b33e79d3d64f98f80838503e802d0369fcdb16.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41901","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"perf(core): avoid storing LView in __ngContext__ (#41358)\"\" (#41901)"},{"Id":"872993106","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T20:30:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"41904","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: update dependency karma to v6 (#41696)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 595a75cda4dc38a3e55c6fbfc97ffad275ab5990.\r\n\r\nThis is the likely cause of timeouts in the monitoring job.\r\n\r\nEx: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/angular/angular/32184/workflows/29f0bbee-c9e0-483b-8850-c538998a9533/jobs/978109/parallel-runs/0/steps/0-106","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41904","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: update dependency karma to v6 (#41696)\"\" (#41904)"},{"Id":"873027774","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T18:20:42","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"41905","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(dev-infra): Set up new common release notes generation tooling","State":"open","Body":"Enables the new common release notes generation within the ng-dev release publishing tooling.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(dev-infra): Set up new common release notes generation tooling\" (#41905)"},{"Id":"872985119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T17:59:29","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"41903","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): revert `watchr` to v3.0.1 to restore `docs-watch` performance","State":"open","Body":"[`watchr` v4.0.0][1] changes the way watched directories are scanned/watched, thus causing a great increase in the consumed CPU and RAM.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen I generate a component, with `--minimal` ( inlineTemplate, inlineStyle, skipTests => true, style: scss), it is generated with test, template and css. \r\n\r\n \r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created a NG app with `ng new bug-ng-cli --create-application false --strict false`. \r\nI run `ng add @angular-eslint/schematics`\r\nI run `ng g application demo --minimal --minimal --routing --style scss`\r\nI run `ng g @angular-eslint/schematics:convert-tslint-to-eslint --remove-tslint-if-no-more-tslint-targets --ignore-existing-tslint-config demo`\r\nI run `ng g library foo`\r\n\r\nIf i run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n‚ñ∂ ng g c components/authComponent --project=demo -d\r\nCREATE projects/demo/src/app/components/auth-component/auth-component.component.ts (288 bytes)\r\nUPDATE projects/demo/src/app/app.module.ts (516 bytes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is Ok.\r\n\r\nBut, If **I change my defaultProject from demo to foo (library)**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n‚ñ∂ ng g c

But when I choose to use Angular 7, it works like a charm.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI tried to find out from which version the bug appears and it seems that this one appears in version 10 of angular. Indeed the drag and drop works with version 10.0.1 of \"@ angular / cdk\".\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI made 2 Stackblitz examples to illustrate my question, you can find them here :\r\n\r\nAngular 7: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wmvtan-vcspfw?file=package.json\r\n\r\nAngular 11: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wmvtan-co9kyn?file=package.json\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22592","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Drag and Drop): Drag and Drop an SVG element fails on Angular 11 but works with Angular 7\" (#22592)"},{"Id":"870843332","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-29T10:07:01","Actor":"ThonyBat","Number":"22591","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): add set centered with class mat-ripple-centered","State":"open","Body":"you have setting unbounded with class but not same with centered so added","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22591","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): add set centered with class mat-ripple-centered\" (#22591)"},{"Id":"870735406","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-29T08:07:53","Actor":"lukasmatta","Number":"22590","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(stepper): Make `CdkStepper` generic to support extended CdkStep","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when I want to use `CdkStepper` with a custom class for a step (extension of a class `CdkStep`, e.g. `MyStep extends CdkStep`), I am not able to as `CdkStepper` is not generic and is fixed to `CdkStep` class for a step.

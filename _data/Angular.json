An Observable Under Test - the easiest way\r\n2. Testing multiple values - using observer spies\r\n3. Faking dependencies with Observable returning methods\r\n4. Marble Tests\r\n\r\nI believe this would make the whole notion of Observable testing much easier to digest and get easy wins in both Angular and also NgRx code (like testing effects) and will help lower the entry barrier for testing Observable.  \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. If we move forward, I could create a draft of the content and work with your documentation team to include it on Angular.io.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve Observables Testing documentation\" (#39144)"},{"Id":"716056695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-06T22:14:11","Actor":"atscott","Number":"39143","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): wrap RHS of property write in parens","State":"open","Body":"The right needs to be wrapped in parens or we cannot accurately match its\r\nspan to just the RHS.

However, since the Angular CLI merges\r\ncompiler options across all referenced config files, the Angular LS\r\nshould do the same, and watch for changes in any relevant config file.\r\n\r\nThis commit does the following:\r\n   - Defer compiler option parsing to\r\n     `perform_compile.readConfiguration`, which already merges compiler\r\n     options across extended config files. Furthermore, return all\r\n     extended config files from `readConfiguration`.\r\n   - Attach file watchers to the project root config file, and all known\r\n     extended config files as determined by `readConfiguration`. On a\r\n     change to any config file, refresh the compiler options known by\r\n     the Angular LS, and attach file watchers for any newly-extended\r\n     config files.\r\n     - Also: properly clean up file watchers, closing them when a file\r\n       is deleted.\r\n\r\nTo test these changes, the mock server host is extended to support a\r\nmock filesystem. This is needed because ngtsc reads files from a file\r\nsystem interface, which the mock service does not provide. Furthermore,\r\nmethods on the mock filesystem defer to the mock host, so the host was\r\nchosen to implement a filesystem rather than the service doing so.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39134","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(language-service): merge compiler options, watch extended configs\" (#39134)"},{"Id":"715705555","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-06T15:06:26","Actor":"Omi0","Number":"39133","RawContent":null,"Title":"ActivatedRoute data type mismatch BehaviorSubject<Data> vs Observable<Data>","State":"closed","Body":"As long as createActivatedRoute() construct data as [BehaviorSubject](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3817e5f1dfeb9de26fa2ea4068a37565f435214f/packages/router/src/create_router_state.ts#L79) shouldn't we define it accordingly in [ActivatedRoute constructor](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cf9a47ba53738bf3b8ce282938211370e946bbf9/packages/router/src/router_state.ts#L131)\r\n\r\nvalue getter is only available on BehaviorSubject but not Observable","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39133","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ActivatedRoute data type mismatch BehaviorSubject<Data> vs Observable<Data>\" (#39133)"},{"Id":"715664642","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-06T13:10:07","Actor":"Mohamed-M","Number":"39132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Required validator does not work with number","State":"open","Body":"Re-opened a bug issue that wasn't resolved, but closed due to inactivity.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6932\r\n\r\n> The required validator does not work with a input whose type is number :\r\n> <input type=\"number\" ngControl=\"weight\" />\r\n> \r\n> this.form = fb.group({\r\n>   weight: [\"\", Validators.required]\r\n> });\r\n> When the input is empty, no error appear.\r\n> \r\n> The reason is that the NumberValueAccessor selector match the input, and set the value of the Control to a number.

When the other one is opened, the background is not scrollable anymore (because of the blocking class), so it removes it again, making the page in the background scrollable again.\r\n\r\nMy use case is only with bottom sheets, but since the similar issue, https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16864, describes the same problem, I assume dialogs and bottom sheets work the same in this behaviour.

Moreover, the `trackBy` function must be dead simple and fast, if the view port is large, showing enough rows with enough columns it becomes a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nUsually, most performant way to do the trackBy is just return the index.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the rowDef has changed, it will not be possible to detect it.\r\n\r\nOnce diff has been calculated, the call to `renderRows` will ignore the change in the row template definition\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/4152aec5d421d993246b1ede3803027082330492/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L611-L623\r\n\r\nIt will not call `_renderCellTemplateForItem` leaving it with the old template cached in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qvzms7?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-flex-basic-example.ts\r\n\r\nBasically, we need to have multiple row definitions (CdkRowDef) but `multiTemplateDataRows` is set to false.\r\nWe define 2 row templates with `when` predicates, where the 2 predicates are opposite, if one is on the other is off and vice versa.\r\n\r\nUsing a simple button to toggle a boolean flag we switch between the 2 predicates.\r\n\r\nIf we use a simple button it will not work, we switch the flag but it does not change the rendered template for the row.\r\n\r\nUsing the `ChangeDetectorRef` to run manual CD will not work as well because the table handles it's own diff mechanism when it comes to row diffing.\r\n\r\nThe only way (I found so far...) to force the proper row template to render is calling `_forceRenderDataRows();`  which is private. The will force render the entire dataset, using the new row template. This is bad of course, as it's using a private method and it will force render ALL rows, while in real scenarios one will only want some to re-render.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nBeing able to change the row definition template and have the CDK Table autodetect and render it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nCDK Table fail to detect changes in the row definition template.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10+\r\n- CDK/Material: 10+\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-table): Row differ (trackBy) does not detect row template changes\" (#20717)"},{"Id":"714035303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:40:44","Actor":"paco76","Number":"20711","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ripple is being triggered when scrolling <mat-selection-list> on mobile","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[link to stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-lists-scrolling-triggers-ripple?file=src/app/app.component.html)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  open on mobile and scroll\r\n2.  ripple is triggered while scrolling\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen I scroll ripple should not be triggered !!\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.0.9\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20711","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ripple is being triggered when scrolling <mat-selection-list> on mobile\" (#20711)"},{"Id":"714282539","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-04T10:22:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20714","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/testing): add the ability to dispatch arbitrary events","State":"open","Body":"Allows for arbitrary events to be dispatched through a `TestElement`.

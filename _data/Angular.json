This wrapper is written in TypeScript but isn't using ng-packagr for building. Instead I've written my own build script, and I'm compiling it with `ngc` the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars/tree/master/packages/overlayscrollbars-ngx). \r\nThe wrapper isn't very complex and also isn't using any special, exotic or deprecated features of Angular.\r\n\r\nSince Angular9 user have reported issues ([here](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars/issues/190) and [here](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars/issues/141)) with the wrapper, which are related to ivy. After a bit of experimenting I found out, that you have to run `npx ngcc` to make it function (at least its working in my project).\r\n\r\nMy question is, how do I prevent this? I know that Angular is running the `ngcc` command if you compile your project with `ng serve` but for some reason this isn't enough for my library. I have to run it manually in order to not getting a error in the browser console.\r\n\r\nI checked the `package.json` before and after running `ngcc` manually and the difference is small, but there is a difference in the `__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__` section:\r\n**Before running ngcc manually:**\r\n```json\r\n\"__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__\": {\r\n  \"module\": \"9.0.6\",\r\n  \"typings\": \"9.0.6\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**After running ngcc manually:**\r\n```json\r\n\"__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__\": {\r\n  \"main\": \"9.0.6\",\r\n  \"module\": \"9.0.6\",\r\n  \"typings\": \"9.0.6\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHow can I tell angular to run ngcc also on the main module without executing `ngcc` manually, or how can I solve the whole issue differently?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36062","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular9 - Need to run ngcc for library to function with ivy enabled\" (#36062)"},{"Id":"580643470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-13T19:35:42","Actor":"atscott","Number":"36058","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): Update transplanted views benchpress test to support VE","State":"closed","Body":"Remove uses of render3 internal `detectChanges` calls to allow test to\r\nbe run against VE code as well as Ivy.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36058","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(core): Update transplanted views benchpress test to support VE\" (#36058)"},{"Id":"580755637","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-13T17:53:37","Actor":"babaliaris","Number":"36061","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgModel with *ngFor Slow down the broswer and the page never loads!","State":"open","Body":"[Image](https://i.ibb.co/54pjR8R/Deepin-Screenshot-select-area-20200313193654.png)\r\n\r\nI've used ngModel so many times and this is the first time this is happening. When I run `ng serve --open` the browser is loading the request forever and eventually after clicking **stop it** I'm getting a warning `script terminated after timeout` or something like that.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the ngModel then the app is working correctly.\r\nAlso if I remove the *ngFor and keep the ngModel, the app is still working.\r\n\r\nOnly when they are combined together I have this issue.\r\n\r\n1.

The problem might be there, or in the compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with 8.2.13 this wasn't a problem.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI generated a library project (`ng g lib cyclic`) in which I created two components with a cyclic dependency: ParentComponent includes ChildComponent in its template, while ChildComponent injects ParentComponent. In the app component, the ParentComponent is used in the template with the *ngIf directive bound to a flag that is set to true when a button is clicked.\r\n\r\nIf I build the library project (`ng build cyclic`) without the --prod flag, then serve the app with the --prod flag, when clicking the button, the component does not appear.\r\n\r\nDebugging the problem, it seems that when creating  the TView of the ParentComponent, the directiveRegistry is null, and the flags are 0, so Angular does not see the associated node as a component. I noticed that if I serve the app without the --prod flag, after the module, a call to \r\n`ɵɵsetComponentScope` is inserted. This is done, as I understand it, in cases of cyclic dependencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, when serving with the --prod flag, this call is not there, and that's why the flags are not set, and directiveRegistry is null.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AndreiVajnaII/ivy-cyclic-dependency-in-lib-production-bug\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm i\r\nng build cyclic\r\nng serve --prod\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick the \"Show\" button.

Press \"Shift-Tab\" on the keyboard several times, and you'll notice that the focus is hitting elements behind the dialog.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\nNeed to be able to open a truly modal dialog that does not allow a user to escape the focus trap in an uncontrolled manner.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\n@angular/material 9.1.2\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nAs a less-than-ideal workaround, I'm able to subscribe to the \"backdropClick\" observable via \"MatDialogRef\". If I've injected a \"ViewContainerRef\" instance into the component, then I can grab the \"ElementRef.nativeElement\" for the component, run a \"querySelector\" to find the first focusable element, and then call the \"focus()\" function on any such element that I find.\r\n\r\nThat code looks like this:\r\nif (matDialogConfig.disableClose)\r\n{\r\n\tmatDialogRef.backdropClick().subscribe((event: MouseEvent) => {\r\n\t\t//console.log(\"Called backdropClick subscription\", event, matDialogRef);\r\n\t\tconst element: any = matDialogRef.componentInstance.viewContainerRef.element.nativeElement;\r\n\t\t//console.log(\"Element for dialog component\", element);\r\n\t\tconst querySelector: string = `button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex=\"-1\"])`;\r\n\t\tconst elements_selectable: any = element.querySelector(querySelector);\r\n\t\t//console.log(\"Selectable elements\", elements_selectable);\r\n\t\tif (elements_selectable)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tconst element_target: any = Array.isArray(elements_selectable) ? elements_selectable[0] : elements_selectable;\r\n\t\t\t//console.log(\"Target element\", element_target);\r\n\t\t\telement_target.focus();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n}","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18799","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dialog focus trap not working when clicking on backdrop\" (#18799)"},{"Id":"579608107","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-11T23:50:17","Actor":"axos88","Number":"18798","RawContent":null,"Title":"fr(Slider): 0-based +/- values","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a slider that has the value 0 in the middle, and values range from -x to +x.\r\nThe line should be colored from the middle to the selected value (currently it's always from the left or right in case it's inverted).\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nPersonality axis antagonist trait slider, for ex: (introvert ... extrovert)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18798","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"fr(Slider): 0-based +/- values\" (#18798)"},{"Id":"579579601","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-11T22:24:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18797","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(select): don't select active item when tabbing away while closed","State":"open","Body":"When the user tabs away from a select, we pick out the active option automatically.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nCurrently, the most used way by developers to define validation messages in form fields is in HTML itself. With that in mind, I decided to add a new parameter to the Validator's methods, making it possible to add a specific message to the field in the form itself.\r\n\r\n#### Creating the form:\r\n```\r\nthis.personForm = this.fb.group({\r\n  name: ['', [Validators.minLength(3), Validators.required]],\r\n  age: ['', Validators.min(18)],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Getting validation message:\r\n```\r\n<small *ngIf=\"form.get('name').hasError('required')\">Name is required</small>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #43423\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n####Creating the form:\r\n```\r\nthis.personForm = this.fb.group({\r\n  name: ['', [Validators.minLength(3), Validators.required('Required message')]],\r\n  age: ['', Validators.min(18, 'Min. message')],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Getting validation message:\r\n```\r\n<small *ngIf=\"form.get('name').hasError('required')\">\r\n  {{ form.get(\"name\").getError(\"required\").message }}\r\n</small>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n#### BREAKING CHANGES\r\nChange in syntax of required, requiredTrue and email validators.\r\nNow the syntaxes have changed, and it is mandatory to add the parentheses for these methods, for example:\r\n\r\n* 'Validators.required' to 'Validators.required()';\r\n* 'Validators.requiredTrue' to 'Validators.requiredTrue()';\r\n* 'Validators.email' to 'Validators.email()';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46449","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms) added optional validation message in Validators\" (#46449)"},{"Id":"1278908674","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T19:56:01","Actor":"fallXone","Number":"46448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navigating to an Angular Route from AngularJS (Hybrid) runs Resolvers and Guards twice","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[#45240](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45240) Specifically removed some logic that was responsible for preventing duplicate navigation in hybrid apps, stating that\r\n\r\n> There have been many updates to the routing pipeline to tolerate\r\nduplicate navigations. That is, duplicate navigations can happen and\r\nrouting should still complete successfully.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that, when this duplicate navigation occurs, all angular resolves and guards are running twice for the route.  As a result of upgrading to @angular/router@13.2.6, all of our resolves are running twice, making duplicate server requests for many of our pages. In one instance where this was found, it actually completely broke navigation as the second network request of the same payload will always error out. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n@angular/router: 13.2.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI was quite shocked that this change specifically was not at all documented in the changelog for 13.2.6, as this seems very breaking to me.  Even worse, it's included in a patch.

If you don't provide a PAT token, Scorecards will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` available in the workflow. Due to limitations of the permissions model and GitHub APIs, be aware of the following limitations:\n\n1.  Without a PAT, the Branch-Protection is not supported, so it will be disabled. You will not receive alerts for this check.\n2.  Scorecards only supports PAT on private repositories. If you want to install Scorecards on a private repository, you still need to use a PAT.\n\nFor more information, visit the [README.md](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/v1.1.0#readme)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;rohankh532](https://togithub.com/rohankh532) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112)\n-   [@&#8203;justaugustus](https://togithub.com/justaugustus) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126)\n-   [@&#8203;jamietanna](https://togithub.com/jamietanna) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145)\n-   [@&#8203;jonasbb](https://togithub.com/jonasbb) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129)\n-   [@&#8203;azeemshaikh38](https://togithub.com/azeemshaikh38) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10pm on monday,before 4am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I'm trying to figure out what's causing this, and if that's expected behavior from the service worker, but I can't find anything in the docs about this.\r\n\r\n[This](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-config#urls) documentation says:\r\n\r\n> A list of URL patterns. URLs that match these patterns are cached according to this data group's policy. Only non-mutating requests (GET and HEAD) are cached.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to think that a PUT request will be relayed through the service worker to the API (but not cached), and that the response also will on the way back.\r\n\r\nWhat really happens is that the service worker responds with a 504 Gateway Timeout. If I bypass the service worker, I get a status code 0 (which is what I was expecting because I read it somewhere in the Angular docs I think, though I can't find it again).\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on how one is supposed to handle detecting that the app is missing connection?\r\n- Are you supposed to bypass the service worker to be able to detect this?\r\n- If not, is a 504 response code from the service worker expected for a PUT method when offline? Or am I missing something?\r\n- Is 504 a better way of detecting network issues than 0 (as it seems like code 0 is a generic error code)?\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this behavior would be documented on the referred page. If this isn't related to the Angular implementation of the service worker, but more a question about how service workers are supposed to work in general, let me know. I couldn't find any good resources on the subject.\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/service-worker-config\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Arguments like `noBuild`, `noSilent`, `noDotFiles` no longer work, but `buildTarget` and `dryRun` do. I assume this is related with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22778 and the fact that Yargs supports `--no-flags`. In the past, the word `no` had no meaning, now it has one: https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/main/docs/tricks.md#negate\r\n\r\nIn Angular 13 i was able write `no-build` as an argument and it was used as it-is, but now this is interpreted as the negation of `build` – which is an unknown argument. This breaks a couple of builders that all share some code/ideas and use the same argument called `no-build`.\r\n\r\n* [@netlify-builder/deploy](https://github.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder/blob/b915395041d61d460f3a312c1a9c7cc9a683cda2/src/deploy/schema.json#L17)\r\n* [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages#no-build)\r\n* as well as [ngx-deploy-docker](https://github.com/kauppfbi/ngx-deploy-docker), [ngx-deploy-npm](https://github.com/bikecoders/ngx-deploy-npm), and [ngx-deploy-ftp](https://github.com/bohoffi/ngx-deploy-ftp)\r\n* there could be more...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nPlease follow our [README for contributors](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/blob/master/docs/README_contributors.md), which is essentially:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the project\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   git clone https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages.git\r\n   cd angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Install the dependencies\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd src\r\n   npm install\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Build the project:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm run build\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Create a local npm link:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd dist\r\n   npm link\r\n   ```\r\n \r\n 5. Go to a new folder and create a fresh angular project:\r\n \r\n    ```sh\r\n    ng new test\r\n    cd test\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n6. Add the local version of `angular-cli-ghpages`.\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm link angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n7. Now execute the `ng-add` schematic.\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ng add angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n6.

In Angular 13, when I click a dropdown for the Angular Material MatMenu, it will sometimes position the dropdown options underneath the bottom of the page. I can get it to do it reliably by clicking \"Refresh\" in my browser over and over (it happens roughly 50% of the time so I can usually get the behavior to come out with the 4th refresh or so).\r\n\r\n2. When I inspect the css in DevTools, I see that `cdk-overlay-container` does not have the styles like `position: fixed;` that place it in the right location. In other words, the material styles do not seem to have loaded.\r\n\r\n3. This bug does **not** occur in development, only when building (`ng build`) or serving in production (`ng serve --configuration production`). Moreover, if I set `optimization: false` within `angular.json` for `production`, the bug also disappears. This is why I am posting this issue within the angular-cli repo as I am guessing that the issue stems from the minification process or something else in the optimization process.\r\n\r\n4. In looking around, a lot of other people who have experienced the same Angular Material issue experience it when they do not load the prebuilt themes (e.g. https://github.com/angular/components/issues/1387), but I do have the prebuilt themes loaded correctly (which is why for me it works around 50% of the time, but doesn't work 50% of the time). I was able to find one other case in which others experienced \"random\" occurrences of missing styles like what I'm experiencing. In that issue (links below), it was found that \"Chrome loads styles for Material later then application starts rendering in Angular\". So my **guess** is that the bug I'm experiencing is also related to the timing of when styles are being loaded.\r\n\r\n* https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t915721/devextreme-material-theme-doesn-t-load-properly-in-production-build\r\n* https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t917577/devextreme-does-not-attach-additional-classes-to-dx-viewport-in-chrome-84-on-the-first\r\n\r\nAny chance all of those clues mean something to someone?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI haven't quite been able to create a simple reproduction in Stackblitz, but I got pretty close with this Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-afy6ka?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.css,src%2Fstyles.scss,angular.json. When I first created that stackblitz and started working towards a reproduction, I recreated the problem by just removing the `aot: true` from `angular.json` and adding a simple example of a mat-menu within a page with `height: 100%;` for `html`, `body`, and all containers. However, once I used the \"Share\" link from the Stackblitz, the problem wasn't there anymore. I created a screen recording to show that I really did create the effect in this Stackblitz, but it somehow disappeared when I Shared it and also after I refreshing the browser\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863081/174004841-7edb886f-f8dc-4085-8bc5-3dea3fc883c2.mov\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that the combination of all these clues will give someone an idea of what the issue is.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are

What is the reason to implement it like this? What problems does you implementation solve or prevent? From what I can see, it's just limiting a very common use-case, without any reasonable benefits. If you really insist on this, at least make it optional with an input binding, so we can opt-out of it when we don't need it. \r\n\r\nThe only workaround for this is to use some other value, e.g. '' and then map it back and forth all over the place, for each mat-select.

implementing control value accessor, which wraps a mat-select. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/i919jzNOoXhlPeN4hxxE?p=preview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSelect should display text

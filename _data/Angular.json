The reason was the following:\r\n- One of the components, the `CountdownTimerComponent` component, which is used by the `CountdownLocalVarParentComponent` components and the `CountdownViewChildParentComponent` component, was triggering a periodic asynchronous task (via `setInterval()`), which prevented the app from stabilizing and caused tests to fail.\r\n- In order to prevent this from happening, the example's `AppModule` had special provisioning to not include the problematic components in its declarations when testing.\r\n- Since this had to be determined dynamically at runtime (via inspecting the URL query params), the `AppModule`'s config could not be statically determined in AOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the example to make it compatible with AOT compilation and removes the custom test-command from its `example-config.json` (allowing it to be run with the default e2e test command in production mode).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38994","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(docs-infra): fix the `component-interaction` example to run in prod mode\" (#38994)"},{"Id":"709155666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-25T17:44:00","Actor":"atscott","Number":"39000","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): Add keySpan to bindings in the TCB","State":"open","Body":"The `keySpan` is needed as a way to distinguish inputs of microsyntax\r\nbindings because they will all have the same sourceSpan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar _t1 = _ctor();\r\n_t1.ngForOf = something /**sourceSpan*/\r\n_t1.ngForTrackBy = trackByFn /**sourceSpan*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adding the `keySpan` to the left hand side of the assignment, we can\r\nuse that to identify the correct node in the TCB, given a\r\n`BoundAttribute`.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this produces diagnostics that are more in line with what\r\nTypeScript would produce.

Furthermore, we cannot mark the property name as empty in any\r\nother way (e.g. an EmptyExpr) because the property name, as of present,\r\nis a string field rather than an AST itself.\r\n\r\nNote that tokens past a malformed property read are not preserved in the\r\nAST (for example in `foo.1234`, `1234` is not preserved in the AST).\r\nThis is because the extra tokens do not belong to the singular\r\nexpression created by the property read, and there is not a meaningful\r\nway to interpret a secondary expression in a single parsed expression.\r\n\r\nPart of #38596\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38998","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(compiler): add tests for parsing of malformed property reads\" (#38998)"},{"Id":"709018438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-25T15:15:25","Actor":"aamanunin","Number":"38996","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in Pipes guide (aynchronous --> asynchronous)","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I have also a button attached to the form container which should be disabled if the form (in the form container) is invalid. The problem is that the form container is valid, although the parent form and its child are invalid. \r\n\r\nOnce I attach any validator to the parent form, the invalid event will be propagated to the form container. I'm not sure if it's a bug but I would expect that if the both forms are invalid (parent and child), the status should be also propagated to the form container and it's not. It's only propagated once the parent form has a validator attached. \r\n\r\nI prepared a stackblitz so that you can reproduce the issue.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It looks like it is related to the refactoring to get ready for TS 4 (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21?branch=a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21&diff=unified#diff-b2c222e0f78a5c4cf888115c56457e2dR87).  \r\n\r\nIn particular a change to this line: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blame/a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21/packages/angular_devkit/architect_cli/bin/architect.ts#L87\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nWhen running a serve target through the architect cli, it results in a schema validation error \"Data path \"\" should NOT have additional properties(_).\"\r\n\r\nTracing through the code, it looks like the validation error was caused by the build options schema.  \r\n\r\nIt looks like minimalist npm library introduces an extra _ property when parsing args and those args are passed directly as build options for the serve target.  In the refactor commit mentioned above, it looks like the code changed from `delete argv['_']` to `argv['_']=[]`, this looks to be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nI did try reverting the line back to delete and the serve worked as expected.   This could affect other targets, it just manifested under the serve target for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include:

It's also fairly easy to imagine another user who might have multiple videos displayed on the page in different components and re-load this script as a result of that.\r\n\r\nI've solved this for my own use, however I feel that it would be wise and helpful to guide new implementers towards this as well.\r\n\r\nOne potential solution to this would be to recommend hardcode adding the script at a global level. However, it's possible that the developer may not have access to this (for whatever reason), and makes the implementation of this grow beyond the immediate component. This would also slow the initial load time of the app (slightly).\r\n\r\nA better solution, I feel, would be to recommend checking against the document if the script already exists, and only adding it if it doesn't exist yet. ie:\r\n```\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (document && document.body && document.body.querySelector && !document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better still, would be to encourage use of Angular/Common's Document Injection, rather than accessing the document directly. ie:\r\n```\r\n// example-module.ts\r\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {YouTubePlayerModule} from '@angular/youtube-player';\r\nimport { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    YouTubePlayerModule,\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [YoutubePlayerExample],\r\n})\r\nexport class YoutubePlayerExampleModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// example-component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: '<youtube-player videoId=\"PRQCAL_RMVo\"></youtube-player>',\r\n  selector: 'youtube-player-example',\r\n})\r\nclass YoutubePlayerExample implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    @Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document,\r\n  ) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (this.document && this.document.body && this.document.body.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = this.document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      this.document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could go on to encourage use of the ? existence check to simplify the if statement to \r\n```\r\nif (this.document?.body?.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]')\r\n```\r\nbut I felt that it was best to recommend a TypeScript version agnostic change (while still encouraging defensive checking).\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts/criticism/input is obviously more than welcome. I'm happy to make a PR for this if the proposed fix is viewed favourably/requested.

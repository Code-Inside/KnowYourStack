Moves `git pull` command before initial `git log` to make sure we're up to date before checking if a release is necessary.\r\n2.  Updates both `git log` commands to limit to `fix`, `feat`, and `perf` changes. This ignores more than just `refactor`, such as `build`, `ci`, etc. and should be more meaningful to end users.\r\n    *   I considered doing something with `Revert` commits, but opted not to. Instead, it will treat this just like their original commit. This does mean we might send a slightly more complicated changelog than it needs to be, but it's not worth making these commands even weirder.\r\n3.  Removes install step prior to bumping the version numbers, as its just not needed and we have to reinstall later anyways.\r\n4.  Switches PR target from `patch` to `minor`. We only need to merge this to the `main` branch, and it's not worth the effort to keep the `patch` branch in sync.\r\n5.  Switches source code zip command to `git archive`. This is more portable than `zip *`, which depends on the shell configuration to determine what is included in `*` (mainly whether or not that includes dotfiles such as `.nvmrc` and `.bazelrc`).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62352","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular DevTools release docs\" (#62352)"},{"Id":"3184320992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T23:52:19","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"62351","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): remove `version_name` from `manifest.json`","State":"open","Body":"This field defaults to `version`, so there's no need to have it when it's exactly the same.

This leads to an infinite loop within the service worker, which the browser eventually terminates by serving the index.html file as a fallback.\n\nThis behavior makes it impossible to stream media from external CDNs using libraries like hls.js, as these rely on Range Requests to fetch video segments.\n\nCrucially, this faulty logic has a higher precedence than the dataGroups configuration in ngsw-config.json. Any dataGroups rule intended to create a \"pass-through\" for external URLs (e.g., for https://*/**) is completely ignored for requests containing a Range header.\n\nReproduction\n\nSetup: Create a new Angular application using Angular v20 and add @angular/pwa.\n\nConfiguration: Configure the ngsw-config.json with a \"pass-through\" dataGroup intended to let all external HTTPS requests go directly to the network.\n\nJSON\n\n// ngsw-config.json\n{\n  // ...\n  \"dataGroups\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"external-https-passthrough\",\n      \"urls\": [\n        \"https://*/**\"\n      ],\n      \"cacheConfig\": {\n        \"maxSize\": 0,\n        \"maxAge\": \"0u\",\n        \"strategy\": \"freshness\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nAction: In a component, attempt to play a video from any external CDN that delivers video via HLS or DASH. A library like hls.js will trigger requests for media segments (.mp4, .ts) which include a Range: bytes=... header.\n\nObservation: Open the browser's developer tools and inspect the Network tab.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe dataGroups rule for https://*/** should be respected for all external data requests, including those with a Range header.\n\nThe service worker should intercept the request, match it against the dataGroup's pattern, and apply the freshness strategy, fetching the resource directly from the network.\n\nThe video player should receive the correct video segment data and playback should start correctly.\n\nActual Behavior\n\nThe network request for the video segment fails.\n\nThe \"Size\" column in the Network tab shows that the request was handled by the (ServiceWorker).\n\nThe \"Response\" tab for the failed request shows the content of the application's index.html file.\n\nThe hls.js library fails with a mediaError of type fragParsingError because it cannot parse the received HTML content.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue lies in the onFetch method of the Driver class in the compiled ngsw-worker.js.\n\nJavaScript\n\n// ngsw-worker.js (un-patched) in Driver.onFetch(event)\nonFetch(event) {\n  const req = event.request;\n  // ...\n  if (req.headers.has(\"range\")) {\n    event.respondWith(this.handleRangeRequest(req));\n    return; // <-- Problematic early return\n  }\n  // ...\n  // The logic that processes dataGroups is only reached here:\n  event.respondWith(this.handleFetch(event)); \n}\nThe if (req.headers.has(\"range\")) check has high precedence and executes near the beginning of the onFetch listener.\n\nIf a request has a Range header, it immediately calls this.handleRangeRequest(req) and then returns.\n\nThis completely bypasses the main event.respondWith(this.handleFetch(event)) call at the end of the method, which is responsible for invoking the logic that evaluates the dataGroups configuration.\n\nThe handleRangeRequest method then calls await fetch(req). Since this is called from within the onFetch listener for the same request, it is re-intercepted by the service worker, causing an infinite loop.\n\nThe browser breaks this loop and serves the index.html as a fallback.\n\nThis special handling for Range Requests seems intended for serving cached media, but it incorrectly intercepts and mishandles all Range requests, including external ones it should be ignoring.\n\nWorkaround\n\nThe only viable solution is to manually patch the generated ngsw-worker.js file after the build process. By injecting a check at the very beginning of the onFetch method, the faulty logic can be bypassed for external requests.\n\nThis sed command in our build script resolves the issue:\n\nBash\n\nsed -i '' \"s/onFetch(event) {/onFetch(event) { const url = new URL(event.request.url); if (url.origin !== self.location.origin) { return; }/g\" dist/path/to/ngsw-worker.js\nThis patch correctly instructs the service worker to immediately cede control for any request not originating from the application's own origin, allowing the browser to handle it normally.

I used to start-up my frontend via the following CLI command:\n`ng serve --ssl true --ssl-cert ssl/server.crt --ssl-key ssl/server.key`\nIn previous version: 19.2.7 of the CLI, it starts up without errors. After I upgraded to Angular CLI 20.0.4, when I run the above command, I get the following error at the end of the CLI's log:\n\n> Watchpack Error (initial scan): Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'D:\\System Volume Information'\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f573b4a2-4f59-4315-87b4-7255c04c21b1)\n\nMy

Command Prompt inside the project root folder.\n- Run the command: `ng serve --ssl true --ssl-cert ssl/server.crt --ssl-key ssl/server.key`\n\n**Expected Result**:\nThe Application start up without any error(s)\n\n**Actual Result**\nThe CLI's log contains at the end the following error:\nWatchpack Error (initial scan): Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'D:\\System Volume Information'\n\n\n**Notes**\nMy Operating System is: Windows 10 (22H2)\nThe serve command is run from within an Elevated Command Prompt (with Admin rights).\nI am not a \"Full Admin\" on my Dev station.\nI cannot even access the above-mentioned folder even from Windows Explorer (Access Denied).\nIn Previous Angular (CLI version 19.2.7) the error Does not appear.\n\n### Exception or

previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2.20 (18.2.x latest)\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using `@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.4`, running `yarn` shows this warning:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn\nyarn install v1.22.22\n...\nwarning \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.4 > @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl@2.0.0\"\n        has unmet peer dependency \"vite@^6.0.0\".\n```\nThis happens because `@angular-devkit/build-angular` includes `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`, which has a peer dependency on `vite`.\nHowever, `build-angular` itself does not actually use this plugin, so the dependency is unnecessary.\n\nThis issue was fixed once in v18.2.x (issue: #29921 , PR: #29928 ),\nbut the problem exists in v19 and v20, as well as in older v18.x versions before the fix.\n\n To fix this, the dependency on `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` should be removed from `@angular-devkit/build-angular`, just like in v18.2.x.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIn package.json:\n\n```json\n{\n...\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"20.0.1\",\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"20.0.0\"\n  }\n...\n}\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nYou will get:\n\n```bash\nwarning \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.0 > @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl@2.0.0\" has unmet peer dependency \"vite@^6.0.0\".\n```\n\n\n###

This clarifies API expectations and aligns with standard\nJavaScript behavior. It may warn or error in future versions.\n\nContributed by Yagiz Nizipli in [#&#8203;58518](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58518).\n\n##### `options.shell = \"\"` in `node:child_process`\n\nUsing an empty string for `shell` previously had undefined behavior. This change\nencourages explicit choices (e.g., `shell: true` or a shell path) and avoids\nrelying on implementation quirks.\n\nContributed by Antoine du Hamel and Renegade334 [#&#8203;58564](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58564).\n\n##### HTTP/2 priority signaling\n\nThe HTTP/2 prioritization API (e.g., `stream.priority`) is now deprecated due to\npoor real-world support. Applications should avoid using priority hints and expect future removal.\n\nContributed by Matteo Collina and Antoine du Hamel [#&#8203;58313](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58313).\n\n##### ✅ Features graduated to stable\n\n##### `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()`\n\nThis method compares only a subset of properties in deep object comparisons,\nuseful for flexible test assertions. Its stabilization means it's now safe for\ngeneral use and won't change unexpectedly in future releases.\n\nContributed by Ruben Bridgewater in [#&#8203;57370](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57370).\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n\n- `dirent.parentPath`\n- `filehandle.readableWebStream()`\n- `fs.glob()`\n- `fs.openAsBlob()`\n- `node:readline/promises`\n- `port.hasRef()`\n- `readable.compose()`\n- `readable.iterator()`\n- `readable.readableAborted`\n- `readable.readableDidRead`\n- `Duplex.fromWeb()`\n- `Duplex.toWeb()`\n- `Readable.fromWeb()`\n- `Readable.isDisturbed()`\n- `Readable.toWeb()`\n- `stream.isErrored()`\n- `stream.isReadable()`\n- `URL.createObjectURL()`\n- `URL.revokeObjectURL()`\n- `v8.setHeapSnapshotNearHeapLimit()`\n- `Writable.fromWeb()`\n- `Writable.toWeb()`\n- `writable.writableAborted`\n- Startup Snapshot API\n- `ERR_INPUT_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`\n- `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`\n- `ERR_UNKNOWN_MODULE_FORMAT`\n- `ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE`\n\nContributed by James M Snell in\n[#&#8203;57513](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57513) and\n[#&#8203;58541](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58541).\n\n##### Semver-minor features\n\n##### 🔧 `fs.FileHandle.readableWebStream` gets `autoClose` option\n\nThis gives developers explicit control over whether the file descriptor should\nbe closed when the stream ends. Helps avoid subtle resource leaks.\n\nContributed by James M Snell in [#&#8203;58548](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58548).\n\n##### 🔧 `fs.Dir` now supports **explicit resource management**\n\nThis improves ergonomics around async iteration of directories. Developers can\nnow manually control when a directory is closed using `.close()` or with `Symbol.asyncDispose`.\n\nContributed by Antoine du Hamel in [#&#8203;58206](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58206).\n\n##### 📊 `http2` gains diagnostics channel: `http2.server.stream.finish`\n\nAdds observability support for when a stream finishes. Useful for logging,\nmonitoring, and debugging HTTP/2 behavior without patching internals.\n\nContributed by Darshan Sen in [#&#8203;58560](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58560).\n\n##### 🔐 Permissions: implicit allow-fs-read to entrypoint\n\nNode.js permissions model now allows read access to the entry file by default.\nIt makes running permission-restricted apps smoother while preserving security.\n\nContributed by Rafael Gonzaga in [#&#8203;58579](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58579).\n\n##### 🎨 `util.styleText()` adds `'none'` style\n\nThis lets developers remove styling cleanly without hacks. Useful for overriding\ninherited terminal styles when composing styled strings.\n\nContributed by James M Snell in [#&#8203;58437](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58437).\n\n##### 🧑‍💻 Community updates\n\n- \\[[`0105c13556`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/0105c13556)] -

For existing projects, ng update will enable suffix generation by updating your angular.json. To enable suffix generation in new projects, use the following schematic configuration:\n\n```\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"app\": {\n      ...\n      \"schematics\": {\n        \"@schematics/angular:component\": { \"type\": \"component\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:directive\": { \"type\": \"directive\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:service\": { \"type\": \"service\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:guard\": { \"typeSeparator\": \".\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:interceptor\": { \"typeSeparator\": \".\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:module\": { \"typeSeparator\": \".\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:pipe\": { \"typeSeparator\": \".\" },\n        \"@schematics/angular:resolver\": { \"typeSeparator\": \".\" }\n      },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### The solution:\n\nTo add an option to the new command, to be able to create a new application with suffixes:\n\n`ng new angular-app --with-suffix`\n\nThis command will automatically add **schematics** to the `angular.json` and creates e.g. `app.component.ts` instead off `app.ts`\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe only way to achive this, add manually the schematics and rename the auto generated files manually.\nThis is time consuming.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30594","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CLI: [command new] add option to enable previous suffix generation on create\" (#30594)"},{"Id":"3172683503","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-24T18:44:30","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30591","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): provide partial custom postcss configuration support","State":"closed","Body":"The `browser` builder now supports providing a custom postcss configuration similar to the functionality available in the `@angular/build:application` builder.

[#&#8203;1022](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1022)\n\n##### API\n\n[envapi](https://redirect.github.com/webpod/envapi) is a tiny 100 LOC [dotenv](https://redirect.github.com/motdotla/dotenv)-inspired parser and serializer that we've integrated into zx.\n\n```ts\nimport { dotenv, fs } from 'zx'\n\n// parse\nconst env = dotenv.parse('A=A\\nFOO=BAR') // { A: 'A', FOO: 'BAR' }\n\n// serialize\nconst raw = dotenv.stringify(env) // A=A\\nFOO=BAR\nawait fs.writeFile('.env', raw)\n\n// load\ndotenv.load('.env') // { A: 'A', FOO: 'BAR' }\n\n// update the process.env\ndotenv.config('.env')\nprocess.env.A // A\n```\n\n##### CLI\n\n```sh\nzx --env .env script.mjs\nzx --env-file .env script.mjs\n```\n\n##### QnA\n\n— Why not use `dotenv` directly?\\\n— 1) Size does matter  2) We'd like to avoid internal vaults.\n\n— Why not load `.env` by default?\\\n— 1) Explicit is better than implicit 2) Runtime itself (like bun) may provide the feature.\n\n#### Chore\n\n- Provided `stdall` piping [#&#8203;1033](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1033)\n- Exposed ProcessPromise `fullCmd` and unique `id`

[`v8.3.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/8.3.0): – Pipes of Steel\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/compare/8.2.4...8.3.0)\n\nA few weeks ago zx took a part in **OSS Library Night** 🎉\\\nMany thanks to the organizers and contributors who have boosted the project with their pull requests!\n\nToday we are releasing the zx with a huge bunch of new features and improvements.\n\n#### Features\n\n##### API\n\n- Implemented `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` API for `ProcessPromise` [#&#8203;984](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/984) [#&#8203;998](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/998) [#&#8203;1000](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1000)\n  Now you can iterate over the process output using `for await` loop from any point of the process execution.\n\n```ts\nconst process = $`sleep 0.1; echo Chunk1; sleep 0.1; echo Chunk2; sleep 0.2; echo Chunk3; sleep 0.1; echo Chunk4;`\nconst chunks = []\n\nawait new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 250))\nfor await (const chunk of process) {\n  chunks.push(chunk)\n}\n\nchunks.length //  4\nchunks[0]     // 'Chunk1'\nchunks[3]     // 'Chunk4'\n```\n\n- zx version is available via JS API [#&#8203;986](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/986)\n\n```ts\nimport { version } from 'zx'\nconst [major] = (version || '').split('.').map(Number)\nif (major < 6)\n  throw new Error('zx >= 6 is required')\n```\n\n##### Pipes\n\n- Enabled stream picking for `pipe()` [#&#8203;1023](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1023)\n\n```ts\nconst p = $`echo foo >&2; echo bar`\nconst o1 = (await p.pipe.stderr`cat`).toString()\nconst o2 = (await p.pipe.stdout`cat`).toString()\n\nassert.equal(o1, 'foo\\n')  // <- piped from stderr\nassert.equal(o2, 'bar\\n')  // <- stdout\n```\n\n- Added `signal` handling on piping [#&#8203;992](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/992)\n\n```js\nconst ac = new AbortController()\nconst { signal } = ac\nconst p = $({ signal, nothrow: true })`echo test`.pipe`sleep 999`\nsetTimeout(() => ac.abort(), 50)\n\ntry {\n  await p\n} catch ({ message }) {\n  message // The operation was aborted\n}\n```\n\n- Added direct piping to file shortcut [#&#8203;1001](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1001)\n\n```js\n// before\nawait $`echo \"Hello, stdout!\"`.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/output.txt'))\n\n// after\nawait $`echo \"Hello, stdout!\"`.pipe('/tmp/output.txt')\n```\n\n##### CLI\n\n- Provided `$.defaults` setting via `ZX_`-prefixed environment variables [#&#8203;988](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/988) [#&#8203;998](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/998)\n\n```bash\nZX_VERBOSE=true ZX_SHELL='/bin/bash' zx script.mjs\n```\n\n- Introduced `--env` option to load dotenvs [1022](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1022) [#&#8203;1030](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1030)\n\n```bash\nzx --env=/path/to/some.env script\n```\n\n- Landed installation registry customization [#&#8203;994](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/994)\n\n```bash\nzx --install --registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com script.mjs\n```\n\n- Added `--prefer-local` option [#&#8203;1015](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/1015)\n\n#### Fixes\n\n- Fixed temp assets clutter on `process.exit()` [#&#8203;993](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/issues/993) [#&#8203;997](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/997)\n- Handle tslib-generated string templates

[retry()](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx#retry) & [spinner()](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx#spinner) now available in **zx** without the experimental flag.\n- Added support for `~~~` blocks in [markdown](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx#markdown-scripts) scripts.\n- Updated npm dependencies.\n- Added support for **ssh** commands via [webpod](https://redirect.github.com/webpod/webpod).\n\nPS: [Plan](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/issues/589) for the next **v8** release.\n\n###

Autoinstall\n\nThis release introduces a new flag `--install` which will parse and install all required or imported packages automatically.\n\n```js\nimport sh from 'tinysh'\nsh.say('Hello, world!')\n```\n\nAnd running `zx --install script.mjs` will trigger installation of tinysh package! It even possible to specify a needed version in comment with `@` symbol:\n\n```js\nimport sh from 'tinysh' // @&#8203;^1.0.0\n```\n\n##### PowerShell\n\nAnother big change is for Windows. Now, the default shell on Windows is `powershell.exe`.\n\nThis should fix a lot of issues with \"dollar\" signs.\n\n##### Fixes\n\n- Minimist now correctly parses argv when using zx cli.\n\n### [`v7.0.8`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/7.0.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/compare/7.0.7...7.0.8)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- fix: avoid redundant `$.verbose` reassignment on CLI init by [@&#8203;antongolub](https://redirect.github.com/antongolub) in [https://github.com/google/zx/pull/475](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/475)\n- fix: let $.spawn be configurable by [@&#8203;antongolub](https://redirect.github.com/antongolub) in [https://github.com/google/zx/pull/486](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/486)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/google/zx/compare/7.0.7...7.0.8\n\n### [`v7.0.7`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/7.0.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/compare/7.0.6...7.0.7)\n\n- Fixed $ to be more like a normal function in [https://github.com/google/zx/pull/472](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/pull/472)\n\nNow it's possible to do:\n\n```js\nconst my$ = $.bind(null)\nconst foo = await my$`echo foo`\n```\n\n### [`v7.0.6`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/7.0.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/compare/7.0.5...7.0.6)\n\n- Bunch of fixes and improvements. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ\n\n### [`v7.0.5`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/7.0.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/compare/7.0.4...7.0.5)\n\n- Fixed types definitions for autocomplete in VSCode [#&#8203;466](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/issues/466)\n\n### [`v7.0.4`](https://redirect.github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/7.0.4)\n\n[Compare Source](htt\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

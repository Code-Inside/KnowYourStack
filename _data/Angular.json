We would like to expose the types of the Language Service to external\r\n   users (like the VSCode extension) via the npm package, on the top\r\n   level of the package\r\n2. We would like the View Engine and Ivy LS to share a common interface\r\n   (notably after the inclusion of `getTcb`, the Ivy LS upholds a\r\n   strict superset of `ts.LanguageService`; previously both VE and Ivy\r\n   LS were aligned on `ts.LanguageService`.)\r\n\r\nTo this end, this commit refactors the exports on the toplevel of the\r\n`language-service/` package to just be types common to both the VE and\r\nIvy language services. The VE and Ivy build targets then import and use\r\nthese types accordingly, and the expectation is that an external user\r\nwill just import the relevant typings from the toplevel package without\r\ndiving into either the VE or Ivy sources.\r\n\r\nFollow up on #40607\r\n\r\nPR Close #40621\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

formatting issues with a `BAZEL.build` file and fails. It suggests (or prompts the user) to run `ng-dev format files ...` to fix the issue, but that command does not fix the linting failure.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the problem was a glob pattern that included a constant string (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40621#issuecomment-772482472). The fix was to manually change the pattern as follows:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-srcs = glob([\"constant.string\", \"glob/*.pattern\"]),\r\n+srcs = [\"constant.string\"] + glob([\"glob/*.pattern\"]),\r\n```\r\n\r\n##\r\nNot sure what is the best way to fix this.

This means the build can be broken because the `assets` folder doesn't contain all required runtime assets, but we won't realize until runtime.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe feature request is to add an array field `files` that can be used instead of `glob` to tell exactly which files to copy: `\"files\": \r\n```\r\n    \"assets\": [\r\n        ...\r\n        {\r\n            \"files\": [\"jquery.min.js\", \"jquery.min.map\"],\r\n            \"input\": \"./node_modules/jquery/dist\",\r\n            \"output\": \"/assets/jquery\"\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI considered listing the `jquery.min.js` file in the `scripts` section of `angular.json`, but this solution doesn't work perfectly for cases when it's not a \"js\" file I want in the assets folder. For example, mapbox comes with a folder with images, that I need copied to the assets folder.\r\n\r\nAn alternatively feature implementation I considered recommending was you could add an option `failIfNoMatch` to make the build fail if the glob doesn't match anything: `\"failIfNoMatch\": true`. But this solution is not as useful as the `files` one though, as the glob `jquery.min.{js,map}` would succeed even if it finds only one of the required files.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19952","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow failing build if there are missing runtime assets\" (#19952)"},{"Id":"800338564","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-03T13:40:44","Actor":"yjaaidi","Number":"19951","RawContent":null,"Title":"LoggerApi.error should accept messages of type Error","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n`LoggerApi.error` only accept string messages:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/efb97c87f023497dc59a2f4fa3825a2ca78606da/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/logger/logger.ts#L91\r\n \r\nWhen implementing a custom builder, we have to convert errors to strings before logging them with some logic like:\r\n```ts\r\ncontext.logger.error(error.stack ?? error.toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWould that make sense to move this logic inside the logger and change the signature to:\r\n```ts\r\nerror(error: string | Error, ...)\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19951","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"LoggerApi.error should accept messages of type Error\" (#19951)"},{"Id":"800209789","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-03T12:35:07","Actor":"Neutrino-Sunset","Number":"19948","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I get Angular to ignore typescript 'errors'","State":"closed","Body":"I'm adding functionality to a large and complex Angular 11 application. I have `ng build watch` running and typically making large changes, testing them, and then iterating.\r\n\r\nThe biggest waste of my time at the moment is waiting for Angular to build a set of changes, go to test it, finding it's not working, then finding it's not working because the browser bundles haven't been updated and the code is stale because Typescript is pissed because there is an unused variable somewhere in the codebase.\r\n\r\nGiven the scale of the changes I'm making, time spent polishing the code to conform to every single Typescript rule ever invented, after every single change I make, when my current changes are still highly speculative and liable to change repeatedly just totally kills any productivity.

To enable tailwindcss for a project, two actions must be taken:\r\n1) Install `tailwindcss` into the Angular workspace (`npm install -D tailwindcss`/`yarn add -D tailwindcss`)\r\n2) Create a tailwindcss configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) in either the workspace root or the project root.  A configuration file in the project root takes precedence over one in the workspace root.\r\n\r\nWhen both conditions are met, the Angular CLI will initialize and integrate tailwindcss into the stylesheet build pipeline.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19935","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): detect and use tailwindcss in projects\" (#19935)"},{"Id":"800080553","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-03T08:11:37","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"19944","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update stylus-loader to version 5.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [stylus-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader) | [`4.3.3` -> `5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/stylus-loader/4.3.3/5.0.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/5.0.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/5.0.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/5.0.0/compatibility-slim/4.3.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/5.0.0/confidence-slim/4.3.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/stylus-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;500-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribstylus-loadercomparev433v500-2021-02-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/compare/v4.3.3...v5.0.0)\n\n##### Notes\n\n-   using `~` is deprecated and can be removed from your code (**we recommend it**), but we still support it for historical reasons. \n\nWhy you can removed it?\nThe loader will first try to resolve `@import`/`@require` as relative, if it cannot be resolved, the loader will try to resolve `@import`/`@require` inside [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules).\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   minimum supported `webpack` version is `5`\n\n##### Features\n\n-   supported the [`resolve.byDependency`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvebydependency) option, you can setup `{ resolve: { byDependency: { stylus: { mainFiles: ['custom', '...'] } } } }`\n\n##### [4.3.3](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3) (2021-01-15)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   respect the `compress` option ([#&#8203;303](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/issues/303)) ([e964abc](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/commit/e964abcf18147c1a3894e47cc9e8970379ae33e6))\n\n##### [4.3.2](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.2) (2021-01-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   convert relative paths to absolute paths in dependencies ([#&#8203;301](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/issues/301)) ([3ded080](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/commit/3ded080fdc0425c3ebdf41f3204a36bae2eaa02c))\n\n##### [4.3.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1) (2020-12-02)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   prevent search nested imports in css files ([#&#8203;298](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/issues/298)) ([092e52a](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/commit/092e52a5463f7997b3a9545bf636f3bee8fd9dd3))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

There are both ES6 (ES2015) and ES5 code versions available. Here's the start of my package.json:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"@tubular/util\",\r\n  \"version\": \"3.3.0\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Miscellaneous utility functions\",\r\n  \"browser-es5\": \"dist/web5/index.js\",\r\n  \"browser-es6\": \"dist/web/index.js\",\r\n  \"main\": \"dist/es5/index.js\",\r\n  \"module\": \"dist/index.js\",\r\n  \"es2015\": \"dist/es6/index.js\",\r\n  \"esm2015\": \"dist/index.js\",\r\n  \"typings\": \"dist/index\",\r\n  \"sideEffects\": false,\r\n```\r\nThe code at `dist/index.js` looks like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport * from './browser-graphics-util';\r\nexport * from './browser-util';\r\nexport * from './misc-util';\r\nexport * from './string-util';\r\n```\r\n...and all the code that is exported above is written in the ESM style, using `import`, not `require`.\r\n\r\nSo why is Angular complaining about the CommonJS code, instead of happily grabbing the ESM code and using that instead, without any need for warnings?\r\n\r\nFull source code here: https://github.com/kshetline/tubular_util\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-zqghjw?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\nSince stackblitz doesn't show the warnings that can be seen when doing `npm start` or `npm run build`, so you'll have to download this project to see the problem. I suspect you've all see the warning before anyway:\r\n\r\n> WARNING in /Users/kshetline/programming_projects/svc-ng/node_modules/@tubular/time/dist/date-time.js depends on '@tubular/util'.

We store when the map is available via an injection token so google-map components don't try to render before the API is ready -\r\n```\r\nexport const MAP_API_KEY = new InjectionToken<string>('Google Maps API Key');\r\nexport const MAP_API_LOADED = new InjectionToken<Observable<boolean>>('Google Maps API Loaded');\r\nexport const MAP_CONFIGURATION = new InjectionToken<IMapConfiguration>('Map Feature Configuration');\r\n\r\nfunction loadMapApi(httpClient: HttpClient, apiKey: string, config: IMapConfiguration) {\r\n  let url = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${apiKey}`;\r\n  if (config?.libraries) {\r\n    const libParams = config.libraries.join(',');\r\n    url = `${url}&libraries=${libParams}`;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return httpClient.jsonp(url, 'callback').pipe(\r\n    shareReplay({bufferSize: 1, refCount: true}),\r\n    map(() => true),\r\n    catchError(e => {\r\n      console.log(e);\r\n      return of(false);\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [HttpClientModule, HttpClientJsonpModule],\r\n  exports: [GoogleMapsModule]\r\n})\r\nexport class MapFeatureModule {\r\n\r\n  static forRoot(apiKey: string, config?: IMapConfiguration): ModuleWithProviders<MapFeatureModule> {\r\n    return {\r\n      ngModule: MapFeatureModule,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        {provide: MAP_API_KEY, useValue: apiKey},\r\n        {provide: MAP_CONFIGURATION, useValue: config},\r\n        {provide: MAP_API_LOADED, useFactory: loadMapApi, deps: [HttpClient, MAP_API_KEY, MAP_CONFIGURATION]}\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis works great for lazy loading into any given module -\r\n```\r\n// no libraries, just maps\r\nimport: [MapFeatureModule.forRoot(key)]\r\n// maps with libraries\r\nimport: [MapFeatureModule.forRoot(key, {libraries: ['drawing]})]\r\n```\r\nThis is a handy use case for us because only a small portion of our app needs to be able to draw shapes on maps, the rest of it is just for displaying. However, if the user routes to the module with drawing after having already routed to another module with maps the console logs an error that the Maps API has been included multiple times. While the components appear to function correctly this is obviously not desirable. It would be nice to be able to lazy load different API configurations like this even if it meant unloading and re-loading the API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21797","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(google-maps): Provide a mechanism to lazy load the Maps API multiple times with different libraries\" (#21797)"},{"Id":"800672266","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-03T20:24:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21796","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): focus restoration not working inside shadow dom","State":"open","Body":"Our focus restoration works by checking `document.activeElement` before the panel is opened and restoring to that element on close.

AFAIK there is nothing that says that the user must be interrupted to do so. In most screen readers the usage of the `role=\"alert\"`, on inline dynamic errors that occur when focus leaves a field, can cause the error message to supersede announcing the new control that has focus. This can lead to additional errors where the user changes the value of the wrong field\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nHappy to contribute myself.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-error): Make mat-error politeness configurable and/or have a less disruptive default.\" (#21781)"},{"Id":"799816279","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-02T23:33:31","Actor":"dwaynelavon","Number":"21780","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): Standard appearance select's ripple is not visible in high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lh4cau?file=src/app/select-overview-example.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

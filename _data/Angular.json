This token knows how its value is defined and does not need to trust consumers to provide the value properly + your factory function is not exposed and cannot be used elsewhere. \r\n* You can instantly start using this token without needing to set up anything else / create any other kind of boilerplate code. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you want this token to be provided in a component level, and not the root level, you can't do that. As angular's component \"providers\" property does not allow for InjectionTokens.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport passing an injection token in the \"providers\" array of a component (and module). If this token defines its own factory - it should be used. If not - a runtime exception should be thrown. It's better if we could even type the injection token differently, so only ones that define their factory can be used. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUse the \"FactoryProvider\" syntax, which is less ideal based on what I described above. \r\n\r\nI'm willing to try to implement this myself, if someone with more experience with the Angular source code can point me in the right direction.

This encourages code that is not modular and not well split, since:\r\n\r\n1. If I want to add a new provider, I have to not only define it on one file, I also have to provide it in another place (the component). before I want to consume it. Ideally - if I can define it in one place, it would make my code more modular. \r\n2. If I want to split a component-level provider to smaller services - I need to add all of them to the component providers list, which makes for a cumbersome code. It's likely that I will be discouraged from doing so for that reason, even though splitting my code to smaller service might make it easier to manage. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd support for specifying a component in the `providedIn`, like was done for modules.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: MyComponent\r\n})\r\nclass MyService {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if I'm using an injection token:\r\n```\r\nconst MY_TOKEN = new InjectionToken('MY_TOKEN', {\r\n  providedIn: MyComponent,\r\n  factory: () => { ... }\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe alternative is to explicitly list the the new provider in the component decorator, which is not ideal because of the reason I described above. I could not find any workaround that enable me to accomplish this with the current tools. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to have a go in trying to implement this, if someone with more experience with Angular source code can point me at the right direction.

Feel free to close this issue if you think it's duplicated.\r\n\r\nI updated my project to Angular v16 and I wanted to test a little bit the new Signals API.\r\n\r\nI have some components that are created dynamically using the `createComponent()` API.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to use `effect()` or `takeUntilDestroy()` inside these dynamically created components I get an error that I can't use them because I'm not inside an injection context.\r\n\r\nI thought a component was a valid injection context.\r\n\r\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that `toSignal()` and `inject()` do work fine inside the component but not `effect()` or `takeUntilDestroy()`. This for me is a surprise because when I look at the source code of `toSignal()` I see that it's being called `assertInInjectionContext` and it doesn't throw any error.\r\n\r\nI have attached a codesandbox with the reproduction but I will also explain what it's happening:\r\n\r\n- I have the `AppComponent` that has a simple button that when clicked opens a native dialog and inside it, it renders a component.\r\n\r\n- The service for creating the component is called `DialogService` and there you can find how the component is created dynamically (feel free to correct me if the way I'm creating the component is not correct).\r\n\r\n- Finally we have the `DialogComponent` that is the component that will be rendered inside the native dialog\r\n\r\n- Inside the `DialogComponent` as an example I'm using `inject()`, `toSignal()`, `effect()` and `takeUntilDestroy()`\r\n\r\n- You can comment the lines of the `effect()` and `takeUntilDestroy()` that are causing the error and leave the `effect()` and `takeUntilDestroy()` that receive as arguments the injector and the `DestroyRef` and you will see that everything now works fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nCodeSanbox:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/cold-sunset-csz6b2?file=%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts%3A6%2C20\r\n\r\nGithub repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/jordimarimon/test-injection-context-angular\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nERROR Error: NG0203: effect() can only be used within an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.

If the folder is not present, it will use the declaration files that come with the TypeScript compiler (`/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts`).\r\n\r\nWhen I execute the `ng update` command, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n✔ Packages successfully installed.\r\nUsing package manager: npm\r\nCollecting installed dependencies...\r\nFound 16 dependencies.\r\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\r\n✖ Migration failed: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n  See \".../angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the Angular CLI is trying to fetch `@typescript/lib-dom` but this is not the name of the package, the correct name to fetch is `@types/web`.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created the following repository that reproduces the issue. \r\n\r\nYou don't need to clone it, you can follow the steps explained in the `README.md`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jordimarimon/angular-cli-update-issue\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] HttpErrorGeneral: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n    at /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/npm-registry-fetch/lib/check-response.js:95:15\r\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)\r\n    at async RegistryFetcher.packument (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/pacote/lib/registry.js:87:19)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 3)\r\n    at async /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/update/schematic/index.js:671:36\r\n    at async callRuleAsync (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/rules/call.js:77:18)\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.2.8\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25224","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`ng update` not resolving the correct NPM package when using `npm:<name>` syntax as version range\" (#25224)"},{"Id":"1708763504","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-16T09:04:47","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25209","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency jasmine-core to v5","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [jasmine-core](https://jasmine.github.io) ([source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine)) | devDependencies | major | [`~4.6.0` -> `~5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine-core/4.6.0/5.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.0.0): 5.0.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

now compiles with the ESBuild option (using Angular 16), sass files no longer import external resources (using the `url`) correctly.\r\nEssentially, behavior is such that if a Sass file (let's call it module A) imports another sass file (let's call it module B), and module B lives in a different directory than Module A, and Module B uses a url to point to a relative file (like a font file), when Sass compiles everything into a single Sass file, the url that's used from Module B remains the same (which is relative to the original Module B location), resulting in errors around resolving file locations (because the compiled file doesn't have the same file location as the original).\r\nOriginal behavior didn't care about this, and the compiled output correctly brought linked files up and changed the url paths.\r\nWhile ESBuild is called a \"drop-in\" replacement, this needs to be resolved.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

[`v0.17.19`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01719)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.18...v0.17.19)\n\n-   Fix CSS transform bugs with nested selectors that start with a combinator ([#&#8203;3096](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3096))\n\n    This release fixes several bugs regarding transforming nested CSS into non-nested CSS for older browsers. The bugs were due to lack of test coverage for nested selectors with more than one compound selector where they all start with the same combinator. Here's what some problematic cases look like before and after these fixes:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      > &a,\n      > &b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    .bar {\n      > &a,\n      + &b {\n        color: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo :is(> .fooa, > .foob) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar :is(> .bara, + .barb) {\n      color: green;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo > :is(a.foo, b.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar > a.bar,\n    .bar + b.bar {\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix bug with TypeScript parsing of instantiation expressions followed by `=` ([#&#8203;3111](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3111))\n\n    This release fixes esbuild's TypeScript-to-JavaScript conversion code in the case where a potential instantiation expression is followed immediately by a `=` token (such that the trailing `>` becomes a `>=` token). Previously esbuild considered that to still be an instantiation expression, but the official TypeScript compiler considered it to be a `>=` operator instead. This release changes esbuild's interpretation to match TypeScript. This edge case currently [appears to be problematic](https://sucrase.io/#transforms=typescript\\&compareWithTypeScript=true\\&code=x%3Cy%3E%3Da%3Cb%3Cc%3E%3E\\(\\)) for other TypeScript-to-JavaScript converters as well:\n\n    | Original code | TypeScript | esbuild 0.17.18 | esbuild 0.17.19 | Sucrase | Babel |\n    |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n    | `x<y>=a<b<c>>()` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a();` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a()` | Invalid left-hand side in assignment expression |\n\n-   Avoid removing unrecognized directives from the directive prologue when minifying ([#&#8203;3115](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3115))\n\n    The [directive prologue](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-directive-prologues-and-the-use-strict-directive) in JavaScript is a sequence of top-level string expressions that come before your code. The only directives that JavaScript engines currently recognize are `use strict` and sometimes `use asm`. However, the people behind React have made up their own directive for their own custom dialect of JavaScript. Previously esbuild only preserved the `use strict` directive when minifying, although you could still write React JavaScript with esbuild using something like `--banner:js=\"'your directive here';\"`. With this release, you can now put arbitrary directives in the entry point and esbuild will preserve them in its minified output:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    'use wtf'; console.log(123)\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(123);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    \"use wtf\";console.log(123);\n    ```\n\n    Note that this means esbuild will no longer remove certain stray top-level strings when minifying. This behavior is an intentional change because these stray top-level strings are actually part of the directive prologue, and could potentially have semantics assigned to them (as was the case with React).\n\n-   Improved minification of binary shift operators\n\n    With this release, esbuild's minifier will now evaluate the `<<` and `>>>` operators if the resulting code would be shorter:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(10 << 10, 10 << 20, -123 >>> 5, -123 >>> 10);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10<<10,10<<20,-123>>>5,-123>>>10);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10240,10<<20,-123>>>5,4194303);\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This was particularly useful for updating values in real-time during a drag operation. For instance, consider the following setup:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"minSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"maxSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync dragSliderStartMin(index: number) {\r\n  await this.loadFile(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nminSliderValueChange(value: number, index: number) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the newly released v16.0.0, this behavior appears to have changed. The `valueChange` event only emits a value when the slider dragging operation ends, as opposed to continuously during the drag.\r\n\r\nTo restore the previous behavior, one workaround I found is using `ngModel` for template-driven binding:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    [(ngModel)]=\"sliderValue\"\r\n    (ngModelChange)=\"sliderValueChange($event)\"\r\n    matSliderThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I achieved the same result by using `formControl` with reactive forms and subscribing to `valueChange`:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMin($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMax($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.addSubscriptions();\r\n}\r\n\r\naddSubscriptions() {\r\n  this.expectationMin(this.index)\r\n    .valueChanges.pipe(distinctUntilChanged())\r\n    .subscribe((value) => {\r\n      console.log('min value changed', value);\r\n      this.minSliderValueChange(value, this.index);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  // same for expectationMax and maxSliderValueChange\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring up this change in behavior as it may impact other users who relied on the continuous value emission during slider drags in their projects. Can anyone confirm if this change was intentional or if it's a bug?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduction of the issue in Angular v16.0.0\r\n\r\nNavigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v16.0.0: [Angular 16 slider with valueChanges showing value only when drag ends](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-xdmmkz?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, notice that when you drag the slider, the value changes are only displayed when the dragging ends. This is the behavior we're discussing in this issue.\r\n\r\n2. Comparison with the behavior in Angular v15.1.0\r\n\r\nNow, navigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v15.1.0: [Angular 15, same source code, slider with valueChanges showing value when dragging the slider](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-fmmekv?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, when you drag the slider, the value changes are continuously displayed next to the slider as you're dragging. This is the previous behavior we're comparing to.\r\n\r\nBy observing the behavior in both versions of Angular with the same source code, you can clearly see the difference in valueChange event emissions during slider dragging.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 15.1.0, the `valueChange` event used with `matSliderThumb` was designed to emit values continuously as the slider was being dragged. This enabled real-time value updates during a drag operation. I expect to see this same behavior in Angular Material version 16.0.0.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 16.0.0, the `valueChange` event's behavior appears to have changed. Instead of emitting values continuously during the slider dragging operation, it now only emits a value when the slider drag operation ends. This change interrupts real-time value updates and only allows for updates when the user releases the slider.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Version 113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs Ventura, Version 13.3.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27097","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`valueChange` Event in v16.0.0 No Longer Emits Values Continuously During Slider Drag\" (#27097)"},{"Id":"1709995842","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T12:26:17","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"27098","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n13.3.9\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen using `dateFilter` on the date picker, the `selectedChange` event never emit\r\n\r\nfrom what I'm seeing in https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration, the date picker doesn't have any breaking changes, if I'm wrong please refer me to what I need to update to make it work again (and if possible please fix the reprod)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. use `mat-calendar` normally\r\n2. use `dateFilter` for it\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-syqmnz?file=src/main.ts\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event to emit\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event does not emit\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.2 (same behavior with 14.0.6)\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27098","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly\" (#27098)"},{"Id":"1709532152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T09:10:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create ng add integration test using ng new","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `ng add` integration test to run `ng new` first which should make it easier to keep up with changes to the project layout.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27096","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create ng add integration test using ng new\" (#27096)"},{"Id":"1709262962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T03:46:54","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"27095","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): SASS Theming Extension functions for button colors","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a utility API for button colors that could be used both internally and by external clients.\r\n\r\n[For example the Fab button](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/button/_fab-theme.scss) defines a `_fab-variant` mixin like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin _fab-variant($foreground, $background) {\r\n  @include mdc-fab-theme.theme((\r\n    container-color: $background,\r\n    icon-color: $foreground,\r\n  ));\r\n\r\n  --mat-mdc-fab-color: #{$foreground};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can't use this outside of Angular because its private.\r\n\r\nSomething like this can be used both within the current code base and as a client facing API for extending the Fab button colors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin fab-variant($color-class, $foreground, $background) {\r\n  &.#{ $color-class } {\r\n    @include mdc-fab-theme.theme(\r\n      (\r\n        container-color: $background,\r\n        icon-color: $foreground,\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n    background-color: var(--mdc-fab-container-color, transparent);\r\n    color: var(--mdc-fab-icon-color, inherit);\r\n    --mat-mdc-button-persistent-ripple-color: #{$foreground};\r\n    --mat-mdc-button-ripple-color: rgba(#{$foreground}, .1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt can be called like this with color extensions for the Fab button.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .mat-mdc-fab {\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-success, $on-success, $success);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-danger, $on-danger, $danger);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-info, $on-info, $info);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso `_mdc-helpers` is also private.

Especially since you're using `MAT_DATE_LOCALE_FACTORY()` -> `inject(LOCALE_ID)`, which is of type `InjectionToken<string>`, and [in your own datepicker example page](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/219c6d0874e568fe55f30bb5538cb4f1c724a836/src/components-examples/material/datepicker/index.ts#L113) you're also using a `string` as `useValue`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI'm getting the `TS2322: Type '{} | null' is not assignable to type 'string | null'.` error, unless I add an `as string` cast.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27087","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DateAdapter): `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` injection-type doesn't support most commonly used `string`\" (#27087)"},{"Id":"1707262357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T09:13:09","Actor":"Mawi137","Number":"27086","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): form field with mat-label and without mat-label not vertically aligned","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhen two mat-form-fields are in a div and one has a mat-label while the other one hasn't, the fields are not aligned vertically.\r\n\r\nThe `display` property on `.mat-form-field` was changed from `inline-block` to `inline-flex`.

When playing around with v15 and density i have noticed that some components seem to not care about the default density defined in my theme.\r\n\r\nA very obvious one is the checkbox which does not care about the default density at all.\r\n\r\nThere are two checkboxes, a default one and an explicitly denser one. In the theme.scss i have set the default theme density to 0.\r\n\r\nA \"denser checkbox\" is wrapped in a div with css-class \"dense\", which is used in theme.scss to include the checkbox-density(-3) explicity.\r\n\r\nGiven i change the theme default density to -3, i expect the default checkbox to shrink to the same size of the explicitly denser checkbox. However the default checkbox stays the same size, ignoring the default density.\r\n\r\nA simple form-field/input however proves that the theme is configured properly, since the input will shrink based on the provided theme default density.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSee a minimal reproduction on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-autocomplete-density-issue-pzrcpe?file=src/theme.scss)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect the checkbox to respect the theme density and shrink accordingly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe checkbox stays the same size no matter what the theme density is.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.2.8\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.8\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-checkbox): checkbox is not affected by theme default density\" (#27085)"},{"Id":"1706907908","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T04:31:45","Actor":"alexfung888","Number":"27084","RawContent":null,"Title":"matieral tab header: pagination controls flickering","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15\n\n### Description\n\nAt some particular widths, the tab header will jump between two states:\r\n\r\n-   display the tab headers with pagination control (ie < on far left and > on far right)\r\n-   display the tab headers without pagination controls\r\n\r\nI cannot make a sample code to show this, but it has already appeared on two of my pages.

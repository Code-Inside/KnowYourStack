Without both headers I the server render of the page is always done as a logged out user, which would force me to do weird duplicate requests on the client in order to load the data again, which really defeats a major point of SSR.\n\nThis is the interceptor I have that is setting up the headers required on all API requests to properly handle authentication:\n\n```typescript\nimport { HttpInterceptorFn, HttpXsrfTokenExtractor } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { inject, PLATFORM_ID, REQUEST } from '@angular/core';\nimport { isPlatformServer } from '@angular/common';\n\nexport const CSRF_TOKEN_NAME = 'X-XSRF-TOKEN';\n\nexport const httpTokenInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {\n    const extractor = inject(HttpXsrfTokenExtractor);\n    const request = inject(REQUEST);\n    const platform = inject(PLATFORM_ID);\n    const csrfToken = extractor.getToken();\n\n    if (!req.withCredentials) {\n        req = req.clone({ withCredentials: true });\n    }\n\n    if (isPlatformServer(platform) && request) {\n        const currentReferer = req.headers.get('referer');\n        const cachedReferer = request.headers.get('referer');\n        const currentCookies = req.headers.get('cookie');\n        const cachedCookies = request.headers.get('cookie');\n\n        if (currentCookies === null && cachedCookies !== null) {\n            req = req.clone({ headers: req.headers.set('cookie', cachedCookies) });\n        }\n\n        if (currentReferer === null && cachedReferer !== null) {\n            req = req.clone({ headers: req.headers.set('referer', cachedReferer) });\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (csrfToken !== null && !req.headers.has(CSRF_TOKEN_NAME)) {\n        req = req.clone({ headers: req.headers.set(CSRF_TOKEN_NAME, csrfToken) });\n        req = req.clone({\n            headers: req.headers.set('Referer', FRONTEND_URL.replace(/\\/$/, '')),\n        });\n    }\n\n    return next(req);\n};\n```\n\nThis was working on Angular 19.1.7, but upgrading to 20.0.4 referer is not longer in `request.headers`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.3\nNode: 24.2.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.0.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2000.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.0.3\n@angular-devkit/core            20.0.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.0.3\n@angular/cdk                    20.0.3\n@angular/cli                    20.0.3\n@angular/material               20.0.3\n@angular/ssr                    20.0.3\n@schematics/angular             20.0.3\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR REQUEST token no longer holds the referer header\" (#30581)"},{"Id":"3167973921","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-23T12:33:06","Actor":"domov44","Number":"30579","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic route issue, home is loaded first","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI guess Angular does not immediately find the dynamic product/:slug route on first direct loading (refresh or manually entered URL).\n\nAs a result, by default Angular loads the root route ‘’ (home), then, after API resolution, displays the product content. As a result, home is initially displayed before the product.\n\nTechnical analysis\nAngular Router on the client side does not know at bootstrap time all the dynamic routes based on slug.\nIt cannot directly match /product/whatever.\n\nThe SSR uses serverRoutes with server-side rendering that serves the right page.\nBut on the client side, Angular must first recognize the route, and resolving the

but use 4.6.1","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nThe package.json file generated by `ng new` includes the dev dependency `\"jasmine-core\": \"~5.7.0\"`, but jasmine-core 4.6.1 is also installed and used to run tests in Karma.\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Install @angular/cli 20.0.3.\n2. Run `ng new some-name` and accept all the defaults.\n3. Note the jasmine-core dependency in package.json.\n4. Run `npm test` and note the Jasmine version displayed in the browser.\n5. Run `npm ls jasmine-core`.\n\nExpected: The versions from steps 3 and 4 agree, and step 5 shows that only a single version of jasmine-core is installed.\nObserved: Step 3 and 4 show different major versions, and step 5 shows that two different versions of jasmine-core are installed.\n\nThe problem is that karma-jasmine declares a dependency on jasmine-core 4.x. `ng new` tries to set up the project to use jasmine-core 5.x, but it doesn't add [the necessary override](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html#001-karma).\n\nNote: I'm not an Angular user, but I do maintain Jasmine. I've seen this version mismatch cause a couple of problems. One is that Angular users are occasionally confused about which major version of jasmine-core they're actually using. The other is that it makes jasmine-core download statistics pretty much useless for determining uptake of the latest major version, since an unknown but probably large portion of 5.x downloads are from Angular users who are actually still running 4.x.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.0.3\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.0.4\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.3\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.3\n@angular/build               20.0.3\n@angular/cli                 20.0.3\n@schematics/angular          20.0.3\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30575","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New Angular projects install jasmine-core ~5.7.0 but use 4.6.1\" (#30575)"},{"Id":"3165205798","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T17:06:59","Actor":"olfek","Number":"30574","RawContent":null,"Title":"There is no way to add `\"use strict\";` to top of generated JavaScript files","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nEven after enabling `alwaysStrict` - https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#alwaysStrict\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30574","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"There is no way to add `\"use strict\";` to top of generated JavaScript files\" (#30574)"},{"Id":"3160493872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T13:39:23","Actor":"aron123","Number":"30566","RawContent":null,"Title":"CLI does not generate suffix for components by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.1.0\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I try to generate a new component, files are expected to have a suffix `.component` and class name expected to have a suffix `Component`.\n\nHowever in version 20.0.3, these suffixes are not generated by default:\n```\n> ng g c login\nCREATE src/app/login/login.spec.ts (544 bytes)\nCREATE src/app/login/login.ts (193 bytes)\nCREATE src/app/login/login.scss (0 bytes)\nCREATE src/app/login/login.html (21 bytes)\n```\n\nThis also applies to services.

This occurs because the dependency `@xmpp/resolve` uses the `\"browser\"` field in its `package.json` to indicate that certain modules should be replaced or ignored for browser builds. However, the Angular build system (using ESBuild for production builds) does not honor the `\"browser\"` field, unlike the previous Webpack-based setup.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\nThe build process should respect the `\"browser\"` field in dependencies' `package.json` files, replacing or ignoring Node.js-only modules as indicated, resulting in a successful production build.\n\n#### Actual Behavior\n\nThe build fails with errors similar to the following:\n```\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:http\"\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:https\"\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:fs\"\n...\n```\nThis did not occur with older versions of Angular that used Webpack for production builds.\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Clone the example repository:  \n   `git clone https://github.com/andsouto/angular-build-error-example.git`\n2. Install dependencies:  \n   `cd angular-build-error-example && npm install`\n3. Attempt to build the project for production:  \n   `ng build`\n4. Observe the build failure with unresolved Node.js module errors.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/andsouto/angular-build-error-example\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nApplication bundle generation failed.

The calendar component’s header control buttons (such as month selection and view mode selection) currently use aria-label attributes to provide accessible names for assistive technologies.\n\n**Current Limitation:**\nWhile the use of aria-label helps screen reader users, there are still usability and accessibility gaps:\n\nSighted users, users with cognitive difficulties, and users unfamiliar with icon-only interfaces may not easily understand the buttons' purposes.\nThere is no visible label or tooltip on these buttons, making their function unclear for many users.\nProposed Solution:\nEnhance the Angular Material calendar component to allow tooltips on header control buttons. These tooltips would display descriptive labels (e.g., “Choose date”, “Next month”) on hover or focus, benefiting all users and further aligning with WCAG 3.3.2.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nImproves accessibility and usability for all users, not just those using assistive technology.\nProvides visible contextual guidance, reducing confusion for first-time or infrequent users.\nFurther supports compliance with WCAG 3.3.2 by providing both programmatic (aria-label) and visible (tooltip) labels.\nExample:\nWhen the user hovers or focuses on a calendar header control button, a tooltip should appear with an appropriate label for the button’s action.\n\nReferences:\n\n[WCAG 3.3.2: Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31378","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(material/calendar-header): Add Tooltip Support for Calendar Header Control Buttons to Provide Visible Accessible Labels\" (#31378)"},{"Id":"3153871102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-23T08:36:53","Actor":"theoarav","Number":"31373","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/overlay): Output isn't recognized as a signal","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen trying to bind output through a component instanciated with `@angular/cdk` and passed to `ng-dynamic-component` library, the signal output isn't recognized as a Signal output.\n\nI opened an issue on `ng-dynamic-component`: [https://github.com/gund/ng-dynamic-component/issues/527](https://github.com/gund/ng-dynamic-component/issues/527)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-cwmkaoqj](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-cwmkaoqj)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

This feature request proposes a configuration option to bridge that gap and align Angular Material theming more closely with Material Design’s intended behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Background  \nThe [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) includes a checkbox labeled:\n\n> **Color match**  \n> Stay true to my color inputs.\n\n- When **checked**, role colors closely follow the input seed palettes.  \n  <img width=\"1719\" alt=\"Color match ON\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14caa32d-768a-4864-b3f4-5de1d6ea4a51\" />\n\n- When **unchecked**, role colors are optimized — adjusted for better contrast and visual harmony.  \n  <img width=\"1721\" alt=\"Color match OFF\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3144faa-ae14-47a1-ad2e-8d4de737b6ee\" />\n\n#### Current Material 3 Custom Theme schematic\n[Angular Material Custom Theme schematic](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/schematics/ng-generate/theme-color/README.md) currently behaves like “Color match” checked — it uses palette tones that stay true to the input colors.\n\n---\n\n### Feature Request  \nPlease add support for a **configuration option** to let developers choose between:\n\n- **“Color match checked”** — use palette tones exactly as input (current default behavior).  \n- **“Color match unchecked”** — use optimized role colors (tone adjustments per role) for improved harmony and accessibility, like Material Theme Builder’s unchecked mode.\n\n**This could be implemented by:**\n- Providing a CLI flag or configuration parameter to specify the preferred mode during theme generation.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits  \n- Allows developers to choose between exact color fidelity or an optimized theme.  \n- Aligns Angular Material theming closer to Google’s Material Design and the official Theme Builder behavior.  \n- Creates a consistent and accurate workflow across design and code, improving collaboration between designers and developers.\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n### Design-to-code accuracy  \n\n  Developers can faithfully implement themes exported from the Material Theme Builder — especially those created with **“Color match” unchecked** — without manually extracting and assigning role-based tones.\n\n  For example, if I design a theme in the Theme Builder with “Color match” **unchecked** (to get optimized role colors for better visual harmony), I currently have no direct way to use those exact role-based colors in my Angular Material project. While I could technically apply those colors manually using alternative approaches (e.g., setting CSS variables or custom tokens), it's not an elegant or scalable solution — especially when compared to the integrated experience provided by the [Material 3 Custom Theme schematic](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/schematics/ng-generate/theme-color/README.md).\n\n  Additionally, the official [Figma Material Theme Builder plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder) behaves the same way as [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/), generating role colors based on the “Color match” setting. Having support for this behavior in Angular Material would create a consistent and accurate workflow across design and code, improving collaboration between designers and developers.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31392","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(THEMING): Support configuration option for “Color match” (stay true to inputs) vs optimized role colors in Angular Material theming\" (#31392)"},{"Id":"3164837957","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T07:04:43","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31391","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/input): revert wheel workaround","State":"open","Body":"Reverts the workaround from #29074, because it appears to make the behavior inconsistent between browsers and users don't have an easy way to opt out.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding the event from Material, users that care about this behavior can add a `wheel` event themselves.\r\n\r\nFixes #31372.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31391","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/input): revert wheel workaround\" (#31391)"},{"Id":"3164628071","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T01:11:49","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31389","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: add density scale to system map","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31389","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: add density scale to system map\" (#31389)"},{"Id":"3164450524","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T22:00:36","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31388","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk-experimental/tabs): add default aria-labelledby to tab panel","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31388","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk-experimental/tabs): add default aria-labelledby to tab panel\" (#31388)"},{"Id":"3164002431","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T19:35:02","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31387","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(cdk-experimental/accordion): add examples to dev-app","State":"closed","Body":"Adds several new examples for the cdk-experimental accordion component:\r\n- Single expansion\r\n- Multi expansion\r\n- Disabled items that are focusable\r\n- Disabled items that are skipped","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31387","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(cdk-experimental/accordion): add examples to dev-app\" (#31387)"},{"Id":"3158305682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T17:22:36","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31382","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk-experimental/tabs): fix tabs example styles","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31382","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk-experimental/tabs): fix tabs example styles\" (#31382)"},{"Id":"3163193130","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T12:38:46","Actor":"jmheretik","Number":"31386","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(expansion panel): height doesnt resize in safari while expanded","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nheight of the expansion panel doesnt resize in safari while the panel is expanded\n\nin chrome it works OK\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/fcr7qrn2?file=src%2Fexample%2Fexpansion-overview-example.html\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. resize the window while the panel is open\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nthe expansion panel body height should resize in safari too, just like it does in chrome\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nthe expansion panel body height doesnt resize in safari and content overflows\n\n(note: if i close it and open it again the height is fixed)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: ^19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Safari\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31386","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion panel): height doesnt resize in safari while expanded\" (#31386)"},{"Id":"3162647902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T09:52:19","Actor":"fableplay13","Number":"31385","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Deprecation warning: color.blue() is deprecated in _token-definition.scss (Sass 1.62+)","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nHi,\nwhen using Angular Material v19 with a recent version of Sass, I get the following warning during compilation:\n\nDeprecation Warning on line 232, column 31 of .../node_modules/@angular/material/core/tokens/_token-definition.scss:232:31:\ncolor.blue() is deprecated.

We now ship a behaviour that only some engines still support.\n- **Hard to opt out** — apps that prefer native behaviour must add custom directives just to undo the framework’s side-effect.\n- **Questionable default** — wheel-spin is widely regarded as error-prone; many design systems leave it off unless the app explicitly opts-in.\n- **Big change for a small bug** — the original issue surfaced only after a tooltip attached its own wheel listener; solving that by adding another listener to every number input feels disproportionate.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n1. Remove the automatic wheel listener from MatInput.\n2. Re-open #29074 and fix it at the tooltip level (e.g. use a scroll listener or attach wheel outside the event path of inputs).\n3. If needed, expose an opt-in flag like enableWheelIncrement for teams that really want the legacy behaviour.\n\nThis restores native defaults, keeps Material aligned with browser evolution, and lets developers choose the experience that fits their users.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n\n1. Open any Angular Material form that contains `<input matInput type=\"number\">` in **Chrome** (Blink)\n2. Focus the field, keep the cursor over it, and spin the mouse-wheel.\n3. **Actual result**: the numeric value increments or decrements.\n**Expected**: per MDN / HTML guidance, the wheel should scroll the page unless the site explicitly opts-in. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number\n4. Repeat the same steps in **Firefox** (Gecko).\n5. **Result**: the value **does not** change; only the page scrolls.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOn all modern browsers, the value **does not** change; only the page scrolls.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe automatic wheel listener makes Angular Material inputs behave differently across browsers and diverge from the default behaviour that modern engines are converging toward.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19 \n- Browser(s): Chrome / Safari\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31372","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(matInput): drop automatic wheel listeners on number inputs\" (#31372)"},{"Id":"3153244497","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T12:01:23","Actor":"chintankavathia","Number":"31371","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/menu): add setActiveMenuItem to cdkMenu","State":"open","Body":"See https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31370 for more details","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31371","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk/menu): add setActiveMenuItem to cdkMenu\" (#31371)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-24T03:30:02.7026734Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1914}

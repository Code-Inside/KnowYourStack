Before app bootstrap.\r\n2. During HTTP calls.\r\n\r\nThe second is fine, but the first appears to be a real problem.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to use a technique that allows to put content inside `<app-root></app-root>` in `index.html`, which disappears after app bootstrap.\r\n\r\nWhile simple `<app-root>Loading...</app-root>` works well, I didn't find any way to use custom component instead of plain `Loading...` text.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples like the following, but, as I said, I don't want to duplicate code, so, markup and styles are in one place.\r\n```\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <style>/* fancy styles */</style>\r\n  <div><!-- fancy markup --></div>\r\n</app-root>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhat have I tried:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n</app-root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing happens. It seems that component wasn't shown at all.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"spinner\"></ng-container>\r\n</app-root>\r\n<ng-template #spinner>\r\n  <loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing happens. It seems that component wasn't shown at all.\r\n\r\n3. \r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule],\r\nbootstrap: [SpinnerComponent]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root></app-root>\r\n<loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n\r\n// main.ts\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).then((): void => {\r\n  const loadingSpinner: Element = document.getElementsByTagName('loading-spinner')[0];\r\n  document.body.removeChild(loadingSpinner);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent was shown for a second, but it seems that it appeared together with `AppComponent`. I double checked this by wrapping `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` with `setTimeout()`. In this case it doesn't make sense to show it at all, since it should be shown **during** `AppComponent` load, not **after**.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWell, I'd need to either abandon showing the spinner before app bootstrap or duplicate its markup and styles in both `loading-spinner.component.html` and `index.html`. I was also thinking that maybe it's possible to kind of pre-compile `SpinnerComponent`, but I'm not sure how to do that.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41823","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Show Custom Component Inside Root or as Root Sibling Before Bootstrap\" (#41823)"},{"Id":"867982439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-26T18:08:02","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"41820","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Node.js supported version statement","State":"open","Body":"Update the statement expressing Angular's supported versions of Node.js.

This would allow the cache to grow quite large, which in turn would lead to slow-down in CI jobs. See, also, angular/angular-cli#17533 for more details of the impact of a growing CircleCI cache.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, using something like the lockfile checksum in the fallback cache key would cause too many cache misses (esp. with automatic updates via Renovate), again slowing CI down.\r\n\r\n(The problem was originally discussed [here][2].)\r\n\r\nThis commit uses the technique described in [this blogpost][1] to invalidate the cache monthly.

Sometimes I end up having multiple editors open for the same project (different copy) which makes the laptop and editors quite unresponsive. \r\n\r\nNothing is posted in the log that would look ouf of ordinary, except the number of watchers. Smaller test project seems to work OK, but not the main one.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what can I do debug this further? Or what else I can do limit CPU impact? \r\n\r\nFor now basically I'm forced to disable the service :/\r\n\r\nCurrent laptop specs are: i7-10610U CPU / 32GB RAM / NVME SSD\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1985429/116111861-5332db80-a6b7-11eb-9805-5f145c7ff319.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a verbose log from the extension:\r\n\r\n````\r\nInfo 0

The current URL (`https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install`) is about the `npm install` command and not about installing the `npm` CLI.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -which is installed with `Node.js` by default\r\n  +which is installed with Node.js by default\r\n  ```\r\n  ...for consistency, since \"Node.js\" is used without backticks in several other places in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The tutorial recommends creating a project in the `Desktop` directory. I think this is not a great idea, because not all OSed have a `Desktop` directory and for some that do have one (such as Windows), it is not a good practice to create large directories on the `Desktop` (as it can slow down the whole system).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Nit (it is more common to use uppercase letters in key combinations):\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -press `Ctrl+c` while in the terminal\r\n  +press `Ctrl+C` while in the terminal\r\n  ```\r\n  Also, does this work on macOS?\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"`app.component.ts`: Also known as the class\"_:\r\n  That sounds weird :grin: I've never heard anyone calling this \"the class\" :smiley:\r\n  Cold this be a typo (for example, missing a word or something)? Maybe _\"`AppComponent` class\"_ or _\"component class\"_?\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"TypeScript offers [...] a more concise syntax than plain JavaScript\"\r\n  That's quite a controversial statement.

It doesn't have any benefit over a regular method (afaict) and it covers up the fact that accessing the property results in a function invocation.\r\n  Also, I don't think it is a good idea to use an array-returning function with `*ngFor` as it can result in many unnecessary invocations. I believe it is better to use a property (and update the value of that property every time the filter criteria change).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -which calls the same`addItem()` method.\r\n  +which calls the same `addItem()` method.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"Pressing the **Enter** key also resets the value of `<input>` to an empty string.

It gives the impression that you can somehow bind methods to arbitrary child-component properties, which is not true. `ItemComponent#remove` is not a regular property; it is an `@Output`.\r\n  Maybe change that clause to _\"which is bound to the `remove` output in the `ItemComponent`\"_\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"The following CSS adds basic styles, flexbox for the buttons, and custom checkboxes.\"_:\r\n  This is a little confusing as well, since the styles below have very little to do with Flexbox for buttons.

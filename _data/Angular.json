Upon returning and attempting the nested navigation again, the router fails to destroy the previous view. Instead of swapping components, the new route's component is appended to the DOM, resulting in stacked components and missing animations.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-c3jfenwn?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n**Reproduction Steps**\n1. Load the initial state of the application.\n2. Click \"Start animations\" to enter the nested route context.\n3. Navigate between child components (e.g., Route A to Route B).\n   * *Observation:* Transitions animate correctly, and views are swapped as expected.\n4. Click \"Restart navigation\".\n5. Click \"Start animations\" again to re-enter the nested context.\n6. Attempt to navigate between child components again.\n\n**Current Behavior**\nAfter re-entering the nested route workflow, the router fails to remove the deactivated component. The new route component is appended to the `RouterOutlet` container, resulting in multiple stacked views. No exit animations occur.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nThe router should consistently handle component destruction and ViewContainer cleanup regardless of how many times the route tree is entered or exited. The previous view should be removed (with the defined `animate.leave` transition) before or while the new view is added.\n\nTested both on Angular v20.2 and v21\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.12\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.15\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.12\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.12\n@angular/build               20.3.12\n@angular/cli                 20.3.12\n@schematics/angular          20.3.12\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65804","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"RouterOutlet fails to remove components in nested routes when using animate.leave after re-navigation\" (#65804)"},{"Id":"3687976158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-03T00:24:37","Actor":"29naks2005","Number":"65805","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): use getComponentDef in stringify_utils","State":"open","Body":"# Refactor `stringify_utils.ts` to use `getComponentDef`\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `packages/core/src/render3/util/stringify_utils.ts` to use the `getComponentDef()` helper from `packages/core/src/render3/def_getters` instead of directly accessing the `NG_COMP_DEF` property.\r\n\r\nThis change removes an outdated TODO and improves maintainability by using the canonical API for retrieving a component definition.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Imported `getComponentDef` from `../def_getters`.\r\n- Replaced `(type as any)[NG_COMP_DEF]` with `getComponentDef(type)`.\r\n- Removed the outdated TODO comment.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\n- `getComponentDef()` is the recommended public getter internally.\r\n- Centralizes logic for reading component definitions.\r\n- Makes the code consistent with other Render3 utilities.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Existing tests continue to pass.\r\n- No functional changes — pure refactor.\r\n\r\n## Diff Example\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```ts\r\nlet componentDef = (type as any)[NG_COMP_DEF] || null;\r\n// TODO: use getComponentDef once available\r\n```\r\n**After:**\r\n```ts\r\nimport { getComponentDef } from '../def_getters';\r\n\r\nlet componentDef = getComponentDef(type);","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/65805","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): use getComponentDef in stringify_utils\" (#65805)"},{"Id":"3687939243","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-03T00:02:20","Actor":"29naks2005","Number":"65803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Refactor: Use getComponentDef in debugStringifyTypeForError to clean up TODO","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThere is a small refactor opportunity inside debugStringifyTypeForError where a TODO comment indicates that the logic should eventually switch to using getComponentDef for improved consistency with the rest of Angular’s internal type introspection utilities.\n\nCurrently, the function manually checks component metadata instead of using the shared helper.

compilation is used as fallback.\n\nIdeally, the library is processed using the Angular Linker to become fully AOT compiled.\nAlternatively, the JIT compiler should be loaded by bootstrapping using

This improves performance on high-core systems [#&#8203;10068](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.\n- Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#&#8203;10217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).\n- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#&#8203;10205](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).\n- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This improves performance on high-core systems [#&#8203;10068](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.\n- Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#&#8203;10217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).\n- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#&#8203;10205](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).\n- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, when the user keeps the Shift key pressed, the focus does not move anymore. This breaks keyboard flows that involve Shift while navigating, like multi select.\n\n**Question**\nIs this intentional? If not, could `ngGrid` keep processing Arrow key navigation even when Shift is pressed so modified selection patterns remain functional?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Use any `ngGrid` (e.g., the [official demo](https://angular.dev/guide/aria/grid)).\n2. Focus a row/cell.\n3. Hold Shift and press Arrow Down (or any arrow).\n4. Focus no longer changes.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nArrow navigation should continue to work while Shift is held so users can move focus and extend range selections or perform other Shift-modified shortcuts.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nHolding Shift prevents the grid from moving focus; the active row/column stays frozen until Shift is released.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular CLI       : 21.0.1\n- Node.js           : 22.20.0\n- Package Manager   : npm 11.6.0\n- Operating System  : macOS darwin arm64\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32452","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Grid): Shift+Arrow does not move selection\" (#32452)"},{"Id":"3684559584","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T10:47:23","Actor":"DerKapp","Number":"32457","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Datepicker): Datepicker navigation button tooltips not translated and appearing in English","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.1.7\n\n### Description\n\n### Description\nBetween versions 20.1.7 and 20.2.14, tooltip labels were added to the datepicker's next and previous month navigation buttons.

This improves performance on high-core systems [#&#8203;10068](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.\n- Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#&#8203;10217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).\n- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#&#8203;10205](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).\n- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"engines\": {\n      \"runtime\": {\n        \"name\": \"node\",\n        \"version\": \"^24.11.0\",\n        \"onFail\": \"download\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If the package with the Node.js runtime dependency is a CLI app, pnpm will bind the CLI app to the required Node.js version. This ensures that, regardless of the globally installed Node.js instance, the CLI will use the compatible version of Node.js.\n\n  If the package has a `postinstall` script, that script will be executed using the specified Node.js version.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10141](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10141)\n\n- Added a new setting: `trustPolicy`.\n\n  When set to `no-downgrade`, pnpm will fail installation if a package’s trust level has decreased compared to previous releases — for example, if it was previously published by a trusted publisher but now only has provenance or no trust evidence.\n  This helps prevent installing potentially compromised versions of a package.\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8889](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8889).\n\n- Added support for `pnpm config get globalconfig` to retrieve the global config file path [#&#8203;9977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9977).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When a user runs `pnpm update` on a dependency that is not directly listed in `package.json`, none of the direct dependencies should be updated [#&#8203;10155](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10155).\n- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#&#8203;10160](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10160).\n- Setting `gitBranchLockfile` and related settings via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` should work [#&#8203;9651](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9651).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

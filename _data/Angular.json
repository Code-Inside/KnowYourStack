will be first in directives list","State":"closed","Body":"`TNode`s have the `directiveStart` and `directiveEnd` properties that indicate the indexes at which directive instances (including components) have been stored. Currently there are several places throughout the codebase which assume that if a component matches a node, its index will always be `directiveStart`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, we probably ended up accumulating these assumptions, because we needed a quick way of accessing the component instance and it happened to be conventiently stored at `directiveStart`. The reason why it's always stored at `directiveStart` is likely to match the lifecycle hook execution order from ViewEngine.\r\n\r\nWith host directives these assumptions won't be valid anymore, because we want the host directives to _always_ execute before the host component that they're on so that the host has a chance to override them. To achieve this we have to insert host directives before the component.\r\n\r\nThese changes address the issue by introducing a new `TNode.componentOffset` property which indicates the offset after `TNode.directiveStart` at which the component is stored. Furthermore, I've removed the `isComponentHost` flag since it was duplicating the information from `TNode.componentOffset` and I've audited and fixed all the places where we read `directiveStart` to account for the changed data structure.\r\n\r\nReasons for some of the decisions I made along the way:\r\n* In the case of host directives, I decided to go against our current convention of executing the component lifecycle hooks before the directive, because lifeycle hooks are a chance to change the component state (e.g. in `ngOnChanges`) and running the component hooks first would allow the host directives to undo any overrides made by the host.\r\n* I decided to go with a `componentOffset`, instead of a `componentIndex` indicating the exact index the component is at, because as the runtime is set up at the moment, it would be difficult to know what index the component is going to end up at. Another problem is that we appear to have some logic that moves the entire \"directive window\" by incrementing both `directiveStart` and `directiveEnd`. By using an offset, we don't have to worry about the index remaining correct.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47490","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): remove assumptions that component will be first in directives list\" (#47490)"},{"Id":"1380177240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-21T01:20:44","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47502","RawContent":null,"Title":"Http/standalone/independent","State":"open","Body":"* New design using the `with*` feature pattern for `provideHttp`\r\n* No `providedInRoot` fallback - it's a weird half-working state\r\n* Immutable interceptor sets, with no inheritance by default","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47502","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Http/standalone/independent\" (#47502)"},{"Id":"1380176938","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-21T01:20:31","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47501","RawContent":null,"Title":"HTTP updates for standalone, take 3","State":"closed","Body":"* New design using the `with*` feature pattern for `provideHttp`\r\n* No `providedInRoot` fallback - it's a weird half-working state\r\n* Immutable interceptor sets, with no inheritance by default","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47501","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"HTTP updates for standalone, take 3\" (#47501)"},{"Id":"1380145487","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-21T00:33:33","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"47500","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): merge `RouterLink` and `RouterLinkWithHref` classes","State":"open","Body":"IMPORTANT: this is a \"work in progress\" PR and it's missing the following items:\r\n- `RouterLinkWithHref` -> `RouterLink` migration/schematic\r\n- deprecation note for `RouterLinkWithHref` (in a commit and in deprecations guide)\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the Router packages code and merges `RouterLink` and `RouterLinkWithHref` classes into one. The motivation for this change is to improve the DX when those directives are used as standalone ones. Currently, developers need to either import `RouterLink` or `RouterLinkWithHref`, depending on whether a host element for the directive is an `<a>` tag or not. This is pretty inconvenient and when a wrong directive is imported, there are no errors or logs, which makes it harder to find the problem.

We keep these modules entirely independent and self-sufficient and, as such, have their own ErrorHandler overrides. The modules are route lazy loaded as needed into parent apps that require their functionality. Note, although not relevant, the modules are federated (see webpack) and are lazy loaded from other machines. But, for now, we don't believe their federation is the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe ErrorHandlers work fine and catch insider/client 'Error's when running in their own standalone apps. However, when loaded into the parent app which DOES NOT OVERRIDE their ErrorHandler's service, the insider Errors  are not caught. Important NOTE: The HTTPResponse/HttpErrorResponse, errors (ie outsider/server errors) ARE caught since each independent module calls their overridden ErrorHandler actively via the standard interceptor model-unike the insider/client errors that are called by Angular.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we add an ErrorHandler to the parent, the insider/client Error exceptions do start getting called. Which subverts the modularity required and separation of concerns  of our modules. Note, it seems the ErrorHandler must provided at 'root' of any app that requires this feature. Submodules that have that feature are not invoked (except for outsider/server errors).\r\n\r\nIt 'seems the ErrorHandl\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular 12.2.12\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47491","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error Handler Service 'insider/client' exceptions (of type 'Error') not working when lazy loaded by parent application\" (#47491)"},{"Id":"1379034422","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-20T08:37:39","Actor":"Vicachu42","Number":"47489","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): remove doubles of the word \"the\" in comments","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.15.8`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0158)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.7...v0.15.8)\n\n-   Fix JSX name collision edge case ([#&#8203;2534](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2534))\n\n    Code generated by esbuild could have a name collision in the following edge case:\n\n    -   The JSX transformation mode is set to `automatic`, which causes `import` statements to be inserted\n    -   An element uses a `{...spread}` followed by a `key={...}`, which uses the legacy `createElement` fallback imported from `react`\n    -   Another import uses a name that ends with `react` such as `@remix-run/react`\n    -   The output format has been set to CommonJS so that `import` statements are converted into require calls\n\n    In this case, esbuild previously generated two variables with the same name `import_react`, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    var import_react = require(\"react\");\n    var import_react2 = require(\"@&#8203;remix-run/react\");\n    ```\n\n    That bug is fixed in this release. The code generated by esbuild no longer contains a name collision.\n\n-   Fall back to WebAssembly on Android ARM ([#&#8203;1556](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1556), [#&#8203;1578](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1578), [#&#8203;2335](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2335), [#&#8203;2526](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2526))\n\n    Go's compiler supports trivial cross-compiling to almost all platforms without installing any additional software other than the Go compiler itself. This has made it very easy for esbuild to publish native binary executables for many platforms. However, it strangely doesn't support cross-compiling to Android ARM without installing the Android build tools.\n\n    So instead of publishing a native esbuild binary executable to npm, this release publishes a WebAssembly fallback build. This is essentially the same as the `esbuild-wasm` package but it's installed automatically when you install the `esbuild` package on Android ARM. So packages that depend on the `esbuild` package should now work on Android ARM. This change has not yet been tested end-to-end because I don't have a 32-bit Android ARM device myself, but in theory it should work.\n\n    This inherits the drawbacks of WebAssembly including significantly slower performance than native as well as potentially also more severe memory usage limitations and lack of certain features (e.g. `--serve`). If you want to use a native binary executable of esbuild on Android ARM, you may be able to build it yourself from source after installing the Android build tools.\n\n-   Attempt to better support Yarn's `ignorePatternData` feature ([#&#8203;2495](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2495))\n\n    Part of resolving paths in a project using Yarn's Plug'n'Play feature involves evaluating a regular expression in the `ignorePatternData` property of `.pnp.data.json`. However, it turns out that the particular regular expressions generated by Yarn use some syntax that works with JavaScript regular expressions but that does not work with Go regular expressions.\n\n    In this release, esbuild will now strip some of the the problematic syntax from the regular expression before compiling it, which should hopefully allow it to be compiled by Go's regular expression engine. The specific character sequences that esbuild currently strips are as follows:\n\n    -   `(?!\\.)`\n    -   `(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.)`\n    -   `(?!\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))`\n    -   `(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))`\n\n    These seem to be used by Yarn to avoid the `.` and `..` path segments in the middle of relative paths. The removal of these character sequences seems relatively harmless in this case since esbuild shouldn't ever generate such path segments. This change should add support to esbuild for Yarn's [`pnpIgnorePatterns`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#pnpIgnorePatterns) feature.\n\n-   Fix non-determinism issue with legacy block-level function declarations and strict mode ([#&#8203;2537](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2537))\n\n    When function declaration statements are nested inside a block in strict mode, they are supposed to only be available within that block's scope. But in \"sloppy mode\" (which is what non-strict mode is commonly called), they are supposed to be available within the whole function's scope:\n\n    ```js\n    // This returns 1 due to strict mode\n    function test1() {\n      'use strict'\n      function fn() { return 1 }\n      if (true) { function fn() { return 2 } }\n      return fn()\n    }\n\n    // This returns 2 due to sloppy mode\n    function test2() {\n      function fn() { return 1 }\n      if (true) { function fn() { return 2 } }\n      return fn()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    To implement this, esbuild compiles these two functions differently to reflect their different semantics:\n\n    ```js\n    function test1() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      function fn() {\n        return 1;\n      }\n      if (true) {\n        let fn2 = function() {\n          return 2;\n        };\n      }\n      return fn();\n    }\n    function test2() {\n      function fn() {\n        return 1;\n      }\n      if (true) {\n        let fn2 = function() {\n          return 2;\n        };\n        var fn = fn2;\n      }\n      return fn();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, the compilation had a subtle bug where the automatically-generated function-level symbols for multible hoisted block-level function declarations in the same block a sloppy-mode context were generated in a random order if the output was in strict mode, which could be the case if TypeScript's `alwaysStrict` setting was set to true. This lead to non-determinism in the output as the minifier would randomly exchange the generated names for these symbols on different runs. This bug has been fixed by sorting the keys of the unordered map before iterating over them.\n\n-   Fix parsing of `@keyframes` with string identifiers ([#&#8203;2555](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555))\n\n    Firefox supports `@keyframes` with string identifier names. Previously this was treated as a syntax error by esbuild as it doesn't work in any other browser. The specification allows for this however, so it's technically not a syntax error (even though it would be unwise to use this feature at the moment). There was also a bug where esbuild would remove the identifier name in this case as the syntax wasn't recognized.\n\n    This release changes esbuild's parsing of `@keyframes` to now consider this case to be an unrecognized CSS rule. That means it will be passed through unmodified (so you can now use esbuild to bundle this Firefox-specific CSS) but the CSS will not be pretty-printed or minified. I don't think it makes sense for esbuild to have special code to handle this Firefox-specific syntax at this time. This decision can be revisited in the future if other browsers add support for this feature.\n\n-   Add the `--jsx-side-effects` API option ([#&#8203;2539](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2539), [#&#8203;2546](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2546))\n\n    By default esbuild assumes that JSX expressions are side-effect free, which means they are annoated with `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` comments and are removed during bundling when they are unused. This follows the common use of JSX for virtual DOM and applies to the vast majority of JSX libraries. However, some people have written JSX libraries that don't have this property. JSX expressions can have arbitrary side effects and can't be removed. If you are using such a library, you can now pass `--jsx-side-effects` to tell esbuild that JSX expressions have side effects so it won't remove them when they are unused.\n\n    This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;rtsao](https://togithub.com/rtsao).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.11.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4111-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4110v4111-2022-09-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.11.0...v4.11.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The latest version of the spec have a different runtime behavior to TypeScript’s implementation but the same syntax. Therefore, we opt-out from using upcoming ECMA runtime behavior to better support the ECO system and libraries that depend on the non spec compliant output. One of biggest case is usages of the deprecated `@Effect` decorator by NGRX and potentially other existing code as well which otherwise would cause runtime failures.

You can't use `OverlayRef` as that will lead to the compiler error shown below. A workaround is to use `any` instead.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set strict mode to `true` in tsconfig\r\n2. Try to implement `ScrollStrategy` using `OverlayRef`\r\n\r\n[Repro on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-d5ewhx?file=tsconfig.json,src%2Fapp%2Fcustom-strategy.ts)\r\n\r\n(On StackBlitz I noticed when opening the link I sometimes have to set strict to false then back to true for the problem to appear)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEither `OverlayReference` should be exported, or at least it should be compat with `OverlayRef` even in strict mode in `ScrollStrategy`.\r\nAlso it's a bit confusing when you look at the `attach` signature (or you run the \"Implement interface\" action) and you find `OverlayReference` which can't be imported. There's no easy way to tell you actually need to change it to `OverlayRef`. This should be somehow documented on the method.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWe get the following compiler error:\r\n```\r\nProperty 'attach' in type 'Some' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'ScrollStrategy'.\r\n  Type '(overlayRef: OverlayRef) => void' is not assignable to type '(overlayRef: OverlayReference) => void'.\r\n    Types of parameters 'overlayRef' and 'overlayRef' are incompatible.\r\n      Type 'OverlayReference' is missing the following properties from type 'OverlayRef': _portalOutlet, _host, _pane, _config, and 29 more.\r\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Irrelevant\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n\r\n`ng version`:\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.3\r\nNode: 18.4.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.12.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(overlay): Compiler error using OverlayRef when implementing ScrollStrategy's attach method when in strict mode\" (#25650)"},{"Id":"1376705618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-17T09:34:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25649","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch remaining dev app demos to MDC","State":"closed","Body":"Switches all of the remaining demos of components that don't have MDC counterparts to use MDC components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25649","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: switch remaining dev app demos to MDC\" (#25649)"},{"Id":"1376351269","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T18:52:45","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"25648","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: move datepicker to MDC-based button & form-field","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25648","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: move datepicker to MDC-based button & form-field\" (#25648)"},{"Id":"1375560505","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T08:27:03","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25646","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(material/select): attempt to reduce test flakes","State":"closed","Body":"Tries to reduce the amount of flakes we've been seeing in the select tests by getting one of the slower tests to run faster.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25646","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(material/select): attempt to reduce test flakes\" (#25646)"},{"Id":"1374762514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T06:29:06","Actor":"AlexPshkov","Number":"25645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't type localized symbol","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI can't type russian letter 'б' at the angular material \"chips\" input.\r\nFor example, the first input: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/examples\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25645","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't type localized symbol\" (#25645)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-09-22T03:30:03.6909719Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2592}

In it, a change removing an example of **a service class as a provider-token selector for the ViewChild decorator** was made. The author of the change wrote in the PR description that:\r\n\r\n> `@ViewChild` doesn't work on service. However, the documentation says @ViewChild(SomeService) \r\n\r\nThe `@ViewChild` decorator does query services classes configured as providers tokens in child components. [Here's an example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/view-child-service-provider-selector). \r\n\r\nThe change was to the example of the third entry of acceptable selectors for `@ViewChild`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ff9f4de4f1147ba9ea6d17c31442a2eedcf4e0d2/packages/core/src/metadata/di.ts#L334-L335\r\n\r\nIn the change above, `SomeComponent` is not a provider but a component. The example given is more in line with the first entry of acceptable selectors (`@Component`). \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ff9f4de4f1147ba9ea6d17c31442a2eedcf4e0d2/packages/core/src/metadata/di.ts#L330-L331\r\n\r\nI believe this should be reverted back to what it was originally. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/1d844b9bd8140953487f291e352ff55656154b41/packages/core/src/metadata/di.ts#L334-L335\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThis isn't exactly a reproduction but an example to show that you can query service class providers using the `@ViewChild` decorator. https://stackblitz.com/edit/view-child-service-provider-selector\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/ViewChild\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<img width=\"1430\" alt=\"ViewChild Service Provider Selector Example\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54225554/89108488-9d956d80-d441-11ea-842f-c02d7a2c998a.png\">\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.4\r\nNode: 12.9.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.7\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38323","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Incorrect docs example of providers as acceptable selectors for the @ViewChild decorator\" (#38323)"},{"Id":"671161698","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T19:52:35","Actor":"zaracooper","Number":"38325","RawContent":null,"Title":"revert: docs(core): correct SomeService to SomeComponent","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit b4449e35bfd04c5858ded17c0ce56248d680e8d4.\r\n\r\nThe example given from the previous change was for a component selector and not a provider selector.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it.\r\n\r\nFixes #38323.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/service-worker from at least v8.x till latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Nope, as far as i can tell the issue was always there\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Adding the package to an angular app and registering the module via importing\r\n```\r\nServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })\r\n```\r\nbreaks the app in safari with error\r\n```\r\nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 't.getSubscription')\r\n```\r\nThe error is fired multiple times bringing the app to a crawl and eventually breaking Safari. After a refresh some times you get the following error also\r\n```\r\nMaximum call size exceeded\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nError seems to come from the following line in the package https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/service-worker/src/push.ts#L151\r\nIn constructor of SwPush service the check if service workers is done like this:\r\n```\r\nconstructor(private sw: NgswCommChannel) {\r\n    if (!sw.isEnabled) {\r\n      this.messages = NEVER;\r\n      this.notificationClicks = NEVER;\r\n      this.subscription = NEVER;\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSpecifically for Safari it is the case that service workers are supported but Push API is not.

The Angular compiler generates factory objects which are exported but typically not used, as they are\r\nonly needed for compatibility with View Engine. This results in top-level constructor calls, such as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const FooNgFactory = new NgModuleFactory(Foo);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`NgModuleFactory` has a side-effecting constructor, so this statement cannot be tree shaken, even if `FooNgFactory` is\r\nnever imported. The `NgModuleFactory` continues to reference its associated `NgModule` and prevents the module and all\r\nits unused dependencies from being tree shaken, making Closure builds significantly larger than necessary.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to wrap `NgModuleFactory` constructor with `noSideEffects(() => /* ... */)`, which tricks the Closure\r\ncompiler into assuming that the invoked function has no side effects. This allows it to tree-shake unused\r\n`NgModuleFactory()` constructors when they aren't imported. Since the factory can be removed, the module can also be\r\nremoved (if nothing else references it), thus tree shaking unused dependencies as expected.\r\n\r\nThe one notable edge case is for lazy loaded modules. Internally, lazy loading is done as a side effect when the lazy\r\nscript is evaluated. For Angular, this side effect is registering the `NgModule`. In Ivy this is done by the\r\n`NgModuleFactory` constructor, so lazy loaded modules **cannot** have their top-level `NgModuleFactory` constructor\r\ncall tree shaken. We handle this case by looking for the `id` field on `@NgModule` annotations. All lazy loaded modules\r\ninclude an `id`. When this `id` is found, the `NgModuleFactory` is generated **without** with `noSideEffects()` call,\r\nso Closure will not tree shake it and the module will lazy-load correctly.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\nClosure does not tree shake unused `NgModule`s from the bundle.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: http://b/161548609\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nClosure will now tree shake unused `NgModule`s.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [X] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38320","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Mark eager `NgModuleFactory` construction as not side effectful\" (#38320)"},{"Id":"670160615","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-31T22:33:04","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"38319","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): update unparsable character reference entity error messages","State":"closed","Body":"Within an angular template, when a character entity is unable to be parsed, previously a generic\r\nunexpected character error was thrown.

I've noticed that, even without making ANY changes to the library code, it will randomly build differently.  I can build it 10 times in a row without making any changes to the code and approximately 50% of the time (or more), it will build in such a way that causes a client application to fail to build.  It's important to note that the library itself always appears to build successfully - it produces no noticeable errors.  I'm using the \"--prod\" flag every time to build it with the View engine instead of Ivy.  However, the code only works when the dist build includes an \"__ivy_ngcc__\" directory and a file that ends with \".__ivy_ngcc_bak\".  There may be other differences in the dist contents as well, but those are the ones that immediately stand out.  If the build process fails to produce output that contains those 2 items, then an Angular app that consumes the library fails to build.  The consuming application produces errors that say:\r\n\r\n`ERROR in The target entry-point \"[library name]\" has missing dependencies:`\r\n\r\nfollowed by a long list of items (services, pipes, interfaces, etc.) from the library that it thinks are \"missing\".\r\n\r\nI can resolve this by simply rebuilding the library, then the client app several times until the library contains the \"ivy_ngcc\" items mentioned above - at which point the client app that consumes the library will build successfully.  Again... it is my understanding that the \"--prod\" flag makes the code build with View, not Ivy.  So I'm not sure why it ever produces the \"ivy_ngcc\" items and I'm not sure why it only works when they are present.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nUnfortunately, my library is almost 100% proprietary code so I can make it publicly available for testing.  However, I can describe the approach that I've taken:\r\n\r\n1) I built a brand new workspace, per the Angular library documentation\r\n2) I added a library to the workspace and added a large number of items (services, etc.), contained in about 6 modules.\r\n3) I added a test application to the workspace, which references the library (directly via filesystem reference - not through NPM yet)\r\n4) I'm simply repeating the following commands to test:\r\n\r\n`ng build my-lib --prod`\r\n\r\n`ng build my-app`\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nNode: 12.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core               10.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         10.0.4\r\n@angular/cdk                       10.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                       10.0.4\r\n@angular/material                  10.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   10.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular                10.0.4\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1000.4\r\nng-packagr                         10.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.9.7\r\nwebpack                            4.43.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18430","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Library randomly fails to build consistently, but reports no errors\" (#18430)"},{"Id":"672011471","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T19:41:17","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18429","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser to version 5.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18429","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update terser to version 5.0.0\" (#18429)"},{"Id":"670532727","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T19:39:12","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18418","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update css-loader to version 4.2.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [css-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) | dependencies | minor | [`4.1.1` -> `4.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/css-loader/4.1.1/4.2.0) |\n| [css-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) | devDependencies | minor | [`4.1.1` -> `4.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/css-loader/4.1.1/4.2.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/css-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v4.2.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;420-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribcss-loadercomparev411v420-2020-07-31)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add `module.type` option, the `icss` option is deprecated ([#&#8203;1150](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1150)) ([68f72af](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/68f72af2a09111f74dcacbf7af019fe7eb40cb6c))\n\n##### [4.1.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1) (2020-07-30)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   remove unnecessary `console` call ([#&#8203;1148](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1148)) ([b1b90ca](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/b1b90caaea8eb045177749729340c7906454a84b))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

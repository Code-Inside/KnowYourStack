[`v16.0.0-next.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600-next5-2023-03-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/16.0.0-next.4...16.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### bazel\n\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n\n##### common\n\n-   If the 'ngTemplateOutletContext' is different from the context, it will result in a compile-time error.\n\nBefore the change, the following template was compiling:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MyContext {\n  $implicit: string;\n}\n\n@&#8203;Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [NgTemplateOutlet],\n  selector: 'person',\n  template: `\n    <ng-container\n      *ngTemplateOutlet=\"\n        myTemplateRef;\n        context: { $implicit: 'test', xxx: 'xxx' }\n      \"></ng-container>\n  `,\n})\nexport class PersonComponent {\n  myTemplateRef!: TemplateRef<MyContext>;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it does not compile now because the 'xxx' property does not exist in 'MyContext', resulting in the error: 'Type '{ $implicit: string; xxx: string; }' is not assignable to type 'MyContext'.'\n\nThe solution is either:\n\n-   add the 'xxx' property to 'MyContext' with the correct type or\n-   add '$any(...)' inside the template to make the error disappear. However, adding '$any(...)' does not correct the error but only preserves the previous behavior of the code.\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   `entryComponents` has been deleted from the `@NgModule` and `@Component` public APIs. Any usages can be removed since they weren't doing anyting.\n    -   `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` injection token has been deleted. Any references can be removed.\n-   ComponentRef.setInput will only set the input on the\n    component if it is different from the previous value (based on `Object.is`\n    equality). If code relies on the input always being set, it should be\n    updated to copy objects or wrap primitives in order to ensure the input\n    value differs from the previous call to `setInput`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`. Please update the imports.\n\n```diff\n- import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n+ import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/core';\n```\n\n-   The `@Directive`/`@Component` `moduleId` property is now\n    deprecated. It did not have any effect for multiple major versions and\n    will be removed in v17.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   `PlatformConfig.baseUrl` and `PlatformConfig.useAbsoluteUrl` platform-server config options  are deprecated as these were not used.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

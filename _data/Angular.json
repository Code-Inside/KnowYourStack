The problem is that the `provideServerRendering()` under the hood adds the `provideHttpClient()` call, which effectively overrides any custom configuration of HttpClient, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/06b498f67f2ad16bb465ef378bdb16da84e41a1c/packages/platform-server/src/provide_server.ts#L32\r\n\r\nThis was done for historical reasons to mimic the ServerModule class that imported the HttpClientModule.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to move the `provideHttpClient(...)` *after* the `provideServerRendering()` call.\r\n\r\nSince there is no indication that the configuration was overridden, this leads to hard to debug situations.\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 possible options:\r\n\r\n- Ideally, we should probably drop the `provideHttpClient()` from the `provideServerRendering()` implementation, especially since we merge the client and server configs on the server (in the `app.config.server.ts`). We can only do that in v17 though, since it would be breaking.\r\n- As a possible solution, we can add some dev-mode only code that would use a trick like the one used with `ROUTER_IS_PROVIDED` and output a warning to mention that custom HttpClient configuration was overridden. We can try to do it in the interim before v17.\r\n\r\n// cc @alan-agius4 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"provideServerRendering() and provideHttpClient() ordering issue \" (#50454)"},{"Id":"1724832301","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-24T22:48:51","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"50453","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: resolve all circular dependency exceptions","State":"open","Body":"The circular deps test protects against real, runtime circular dependencies but will pick up false positives when a cycle only exists at the type level. Angular has a number of such type-only cycles, which were listed as exceptions in a circular deps golden file.\r\n\r\nHaving these exceptions is undesirable, because they can prevent *real* circular dependencies from being caught by the test. This commit clears all current exceptions by leveraging a recent change to circular dep testing: the test now understands `import type` syntax and does not consider such imports as contributing to import cycles.\r\n\r\n`import type` is used to mark imports that were involved in prior cycles in a way that satisfies the circular dep test.

It's quite complex (and error prone) to track all these changes manually\r\n- a BIG downside: The solution with comparing objects doesn't work with disabled fields. Since `valueChanges` emits only `myForm.value` and not `myForm.getRawValue()`, the state of disabled fields is not tracked and leads to bigger problems.\r\n- Sometimes you have cases like: You want to add an entire `FormControl` to a `FormArray`. Here you would have many changes between the previous values and the current values, and it's very hard to track them.\r\n- Sometimes your value is an object itself (for example a date object). Then, it's even harder to find out what changed, because the method for comparing the form objects might fail (it might think that it's a nested object where it has to go deeper, like for example in a nested form\r\n\r\nThat's just a few reasons I ran into my now 4 months old project in a corporate environment. There's many more, and most of them come down to the fact that I cannot determine the origin of the change.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could also put a listener on each control to track it's changed value. However, in my form there are about 50 controls and many of them are dynamic, so that's not an option at all.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n`valueChanges` could emit an object which holds all the necessary information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nformGroup.valueChanges.subscribe( (formValues: FormValueChange) => {\r\n   console.log({formValues});\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport interface FormValueChange {\r\n    // the actual form values, so the thing which is currently returned (key-value pair of the form values)\r\n    values: any;\r\n    changedControl: {\r\n        // changed formControlName\r\n        name: string;\r\n        oldValue: any;\r\n        newValue: any;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nSee my workaround from above.\r\nHowever, for complex forms it makes the form/app very error prone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50442","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reactive Forms valueChanges: Expose the name (and previous value) of the changed control\" (#50442)"},{"Id":"1723150127","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-24T04:21:14","Actor":"zjian107-su","Number":"50441","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix first-app-lesson-11.md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, if your method uses signals conditionally, which is quite normal, they won't execute on the initial run, and then the change detection won't work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis issue can be addressed from two sides - interface extension, for the run-time, and/or test-mode provisions.\r\n\r\nWe can add manual/override extension on what signals trigger the `effect` execution, by extending `CreateEffectOptions` with the following:\r\n\r\n* Option `signals` - optional array of signals that can trigger the `effect` execution.\r\n* Option `policy` / `strategy` - defines how `signals` option is to be treated:\r\n   * `add` (default) - specified list of `signals` is an addition to the ones that `effect` execution detects.\r\n   * `replace` - the `effect` won't be tracking signals from its execution, and instead execute `effect` when any of the specified signals trigger\r\n   * `match` - on the initial run and signal detection, `effect` will compare the list of triggered signals versus the list specified, and should the two sets not match, an error is to be thrown. This is primarily for automated tests.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIn addition, and partially instead, `EffectRef` should provide a protocol for subscribing to (at least) the initial run, and report (as parameters) the list of signals that triggered.\r\n\r\nThis in itself is quite necessary, and also, if implemented, will let us simplify the `policy` option above to just an `add/replace` boolean, as `match` will no longer be needed (though a nice-have addition), as tests can check the list of signals triggered during the initial run.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50435","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals - Extended Detection + Testability\" (#50435)"},{"Id":"1722560044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-23T18:28:47","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"50433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: update babel dependencies to v7.21.9 (#50416)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 3c093d767e7a7aeef0999c5c15b0c4c23bc2bc79.\r\n\r\nIt broke symbol generation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50433","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: update babel dependencies to v7.21.9 (#50416)\"\" (#50433)"},{"Id":"1722537954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-23T17:56:37","Actor":"brandonroberts","Number":"50432","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature]: Allow for lazy loading of each route config","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can eagerly load an entire route config, but if you include providers, guards, and other tokens they will be included in the main bundle even for a lazy loaded component/routes.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'page',\r\n    canActivate: [authGuardFunction, permissionsGuardFunction],\r\n    loadChldren: () => import('features/page')\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'other-page',\r\n    canActivate: [authGuardFunction, permissionsGuardFunction],\r\n    loadComponent: () => import('about.component')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow you to provide a route config with a `path` and a `loadConfig/loadRoute` that resolves to the rest of the route configuration, and would be resolved on the matching of that path before proceeding.

Currently the closed mat-select shows nothing, the opened mat-select shows step C.\r\n\r\nb) Imagine a permission system where the user is allowed to select some options of a select box an some not. Here we could use the disabled option. But to make it easier for the user, not showing the options at all would also be handy.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27142","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-select): Allow values to be displayed that are not included in the options list\" (#27142)"},{"Id":"1718535410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-22T16:04:54","Actor":"Naaajii","Number":"27135","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): description for disableRipple","State":"closed","Body":"prior this commit on properties table disableRipple had no description showing table cell to be empty","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(material/list): description for disableRipple\" (#27135)"},{"Id":"1719537201","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-22T13:44:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27137","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: convert examples to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Converts all of the Components examples to standalone to reduce the amount of boilerplate we need to maintain and to simplify the Stackblitz.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27137","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: convert examples to standalone\" (#27137)"},{"Id":"1719171966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-22T08:26:53","Actor":"mcbashie","Number":"27136","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): disabled option doesn't work in legacy version","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nV13\n\n### Description\n\n`<mat-select (openedChange)=\"openChanged($event)\" [formControl]=\"appselect\" [disabled]=\"true\" (selectionChange)=\"selectionChangedTrigger($event)\">`\r\n\r\nThe code above would disable the mat-select component in v13.\r\nWe've switched to angular v15 but still using the legacy version of Angular Material.\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen is that the 'mat-form-field-disabled' is no longer present in the generated html.\r\n`<mat-form-field _ngcontent-wjb-c202=\"\" appearance=\"fill\" class=\"mat-form-field w-100 ng-tns-c112-11 mat-primary ng-star-inserted mat-form-field-type-mat-select mat-form-field-appearance-fill mat-form-field-can-float mat-form-field-has-label ng-touched ng-pristine ng-valid mat-form-field-should-float\">`\r\n\r\nI know this is a legacy version, so it is unlikely that this will be fixed.\r\nBut can you confirm that this indeed in a bug and that it's not me doing something wrong?\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

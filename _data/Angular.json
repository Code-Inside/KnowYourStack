This doesn't make sense, since the cloned object also has the right prototype, so in a way it has all these functions twice now: on the prototype chain and as own properties.\r\nPutting a check in this loop and only copying own properties will improve performance and avoid wasting memory on unnecessary properties.\r\n\r\nIn V8 versions before 7.4 (Chrome 74, Node 12), we had an optimization that improved the situation. This is why Node.js observed a huge memory regression for Angular builds when updating V8 in Node.js 12: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/28205\r\nThat is, we had an optimization that detected function properties that are always the same and shares them in the hidden class instead of actually putting them on the object. This is kind of V8 doing something like prototypes without the user using prototypes. When we enabled constant field tracking, which serves a similar purpose in other cases, we removed this old optimization. This results in us always putting own properties into the object, so they always consume memory, as one might expect actually.\r\n\r\nIs this code only used for Angular builds or does it also affect webpages?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31627","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance bug in angular/packages/compiler/src/output/output_ast.ts\" (#31627)"},{"Id":"469819988","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-18T14:57:53","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"31625","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create Bazel setup for aio example cli apps","State":"open","Body":"Written based on work  by @devversion\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a couple Bazel rules for AIO example apps to use, one defining how to spin up the devserver and another to run the apps e2e tests.\r\n\r\nThese e2e tests will automatically be included in our CI runs in our `test_ivy_aot` and `test` jobs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31625","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: create Bazel setup for aio example cli apps\" (#31625)"},{"Id":"469778154","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-18T14:52:32","Actor":"WH-Ali","Number":"31623","RawContent":null,"Title":"Google Translate","State":"closed","Body":"I tried to translate the Angular website to another languages through Google Translate but it does not work.

The proxy.conf.json feature in \"ng serve\" has saved me many hours of work dealing with CORS related issues.  However, it would be nice to be able to add a predefined collection of HTTP headers to the proxied responses.

I imagine that it would speed up development for many.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nI know that the WebPack dev server allows for this:\r\nhttps://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverheaders-\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this is translated to the proxy.conf.json file, but I can visualize it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n{\r\n \"/employeesWebApi\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"https://xxxxxxxx.azurewebsites.net\",\r\n    \"secure\": true,\r\n    \"pathRewrite\": {\r\n      \"^/employeesWebApi\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"changeOrigin\": true,\r\n    \"headers\":{\r\n      \"Cache-Control\" : \"public, max-age=31536000\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nHot module reloading would be an alternative but I haven't been able to get this to work with NGRX, Angular 8 and the CLI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15095","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng serve adding HTTP response headers\" (#15095)"},{"Id":"469298040","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-17T18:09:57","Actor":"ChristianCRM","Number":"15104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove the \"-target\" suffix from the output dist directory","State":"closed","Body":"I have the requirement to remove the \"dash\" from the filename of the dist files.

regression?\r\n@angular/cli<8.1.0 are good, so I think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using angular with laravel, so I can not directly use ng serve to test my site, but after I upgrade angular to 8.1.0, I found that `ng build --watch` can not work, before the upgrade, it's fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nsteps to reproduction:\r\n- cd `webroot folder`\r\n- ng new test-app\r\n- npm add -D holderjs\r\n- add `\"node_modules/holderjs/holder.min.js\"` to angular.json's `scripts` part\r\n- change `base` tag in `index.html` to something like `/test-app/dist/test-app/`, and it must be the correct folder\r\n- ng build --watch\r\n- open url like `https://localhost/test-app/dist/test-app` then, you will find that holderjs can not be loaded, because, there is no window object exists when running the `holder.min.js`\r\n\r\nbut if I use ng serve, then holderjs will NOT throw any error. this only happens when I'm using `--watch`\r\n\r\n## 🌍

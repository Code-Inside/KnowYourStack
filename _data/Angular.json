This is compounded by the fact that Angular template evaluation also uses `{{ foo }}` which adds to the depth even though they are in string literals. I updated the object param regular expression to support a maximum of six levels of nesting in the object, which is good enough for now.

That is, the project might just include the component file through the program rather\r\nthan directly in the `include` glob of the `tsconfig`. This distinction is somewhat important\r\nbecause the TypeScript language service/server prefers projects which _directly_ contain the TS\r\nfile (see `projectContainsInfoDirectly` in the TS codebase). What this means it that there can\r\npossibly be a different project used between the TS and HTML files.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Nx projects, the referenced configs are `tsconfig.app.json` and\r\n`tsconfig.editor.json`. `tsconfig.app.json` comes first in the base `tsconfig.json` and\r\ncontains the entry point of the app. `tsconfig.editor.json` contains the `**.ts` glob of all TS\r\nfiles. This means that `tsconfig.editor.json` will be preferred by the TS server for TS files\r\nbut the `tsconfig.app.json` will be used for HTML files since it comes first and we cannot\r\neffectively express `projectContainsInfoDirectly` for HTML files.\r\n\r\nWe could consider also updating the language server implementation to attempt\r\nto select the project to use for the template file based on which project\r\ncontains its component file directly, using either the internal `project.projectContainsInfoDirectly`\r\nor as a workaround, check `project.isRoot(componentTsFile)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, keeping the projects open is hugely important in the solution style config case like\r\nNx. When a TS file is opened, TypeScript will only retain `tsconfig.editor.json` and not\r\n`tsconfig.app.json`. However, if our extension does not also know to select\r\n`tsconfig.editor.json`, it will automatically select `tsconfig.app.json` since it is defined\r\nfirst in the `tsconfig.json` file. So we need to teach TS server that we are (1) interested in\r\nkeeping projects open when there is an HTML file open and (2) optionally attempt to do this\r\n_only_ for projects that we know the TS language service will prioritize in TS files (i.e.,\r\nattempt to only keep `tsconfig.editor.json` open and allow `tsconfig.app.json` to close)\r\nand prioritize that project for all requests.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/1623\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/876\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45601","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(language-service): Add resource files as roots to their associate…\" (#45601)"},{"Id":"1201940557","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-12T14:31:10","Actor":"nkdweb","Number":"45600","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to stop downloading service worker cached resources on each & every page reload in Angular?","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nservice-worker\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nEvery time the user refreshes the application, the Angular service worker checks for updates to the application by looking for updates to the ngsw.json manifest.

[`v0.14.36`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01436)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.35...v0.14.36)\n\n-   Revert path metadata validation for now ([#&#8203;2177](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2177))\n\n    This release reverts the path metadata validation that was introduced in the previous release. This validation has uncovered a potential issue with how esbuild handles `onResolve` callbacks in plugins that will need to be fixed before path metadata validation is re-enabled.\n\n### [`v0.14.35`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01435)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.34...v0.14.35)\n\n-   Add support for parsing `typeof` on #private fields from TypeScript 4.7 ([#&#8203;2174](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2174))\n\n    The upcoming version of TypeScript now lets you use `#private` fields in `typeof` type expressions:\n\n    https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#typeof-on-private-fields\n\n    ```ts\n    class Container {\n      #data = \"hello!\";\n\n      get data(): typeof this.#data {\n        return this.#data;\n      }\n\n      set data(value: typeof this.#data) {\n        this.#data = value;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild can now parse these new type expressions as well. This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Add Opera and IE to internal CSS feature support matrix ([#&#8203;2170](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2170))\n\n    Version 0.14.18 of esbuild added Opera and IE as available target environments, and added them to the internal JS feature support matrix. CSS feature support was overlooked, however. This release adds knowledge of Opera and IE to esbuild's internal CSS feature support matrix:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a {\n      color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:rgba(0,0,0,.5)}\n\n    /* New output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:#&#8203;00000080}\n    ```\n\n    The fix for this issue was contributed by [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red).\n\n-   Change TypeScript class field behavior when targeting ES2022\n\n    TypeScript 4.3 introduced a breaking change where class field behavior changes from assign semantics to define semantics when the `target` setting in `tsconfig.json` is set to `ESNext`. Specifically, the default value for TypeScript's `useDefineForClassFields` setting when unspecified is `true` if and only if `target` is `ESNext`. TypeScript 4.6 introduced another change where this behavior now happens for both `ESNext` and `ES2022`. Presumably this will be the case for `ES2023` and up as well. With this release, esbuild's behavior has also been changed to match. Now configuring esbuild with `--target=es2022` will also cause TypeScript files to use the new class field behavior.\n\n-   Validate that path metadata returned by plugins is consistent\n\n    The plugin API assumes that all metadata for the same path returned by a plugin's `onResolve` callback is consistent. Previously this assumption was just assumed without any enforcement. Starting with this release, esbuild will now enforce this by generating a build error if this assumption is violated. The lack of validation has not been an issue (I have never heard of this being a problem), but it still seems like a good idea to enforce it. Here's a simple example of a plugin that generates inconsistent `sideEffects` metadata:\n\n    ```js\n    let buggyPlugin = {\n      name: 'buggy',\n      setup(build) {\n        let count = 0\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /^react$/ }, args => {\n          return {\n            path: require.resolve(args.path),\n            sideEffects: count++ > 0,\n          }\n        })\n      },\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Since esbuild processes everything in parallel, the set of metadata that ends up being used for a given path is essentially random since it's whatever the task scheduler decides to schedule first. Thus if a plugin does not consistently provide the same metadata for a given path, subsequent builds may return different results. This new validation check prevents this problem.\n\n    Here's the new error message that's shown when this happens:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] [plugin buggy] Detected inconsistent metadata for the path \"node_modules/react/index.js\" when it was imported here:\n\n            button.tsx:1:30:\n              1 │ import { createElement } from 'react'\n                ╵                               ~~~~~~~\n\n          The original metadata for that path comes from when it was imported here:\n\n            app.tsx:1:23:\n              1 │ import * as React from 'react'\n                ╵                        ~~~~~~~\n\n          The difference in metadata is displayed below:\n\n           {\n          -  \"sideEffects\": true,\n          +  \"sideEffects\": false,\n           }\n\n          This is a bug in the \"buggy\" plugin. Plugins provide metadata for a given path in an \"onResolve\"\n          callback. All metadata provided for the same path must be consistent to ensure deterministic\n          builds. Due to parallelism, one set of provided metadata will be randomly chosen for a given path,\n          so providing inconsistent metadata for the same path can cause non-determinism.\n\n-   Suggest enabling a missing condition when `exports` map fails ([#&#8203;2163](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2163))\n\n    This release adds another suggestion to the error message that happens when an `exports` map lookup fails if the failure could potentially be fixed by adding a missing condition. Here's what the new error message looks like (which now suggests `--conditions=module` as a possible workaround):\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"@&#8203;sentry/electron/main\"\n\n            index.js:1:24:\n              1 │ import * as Sentry from '@&#8203;sentry/electron/main'\n                ╵                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          The path \"./main\" is not currently exported by package \"@&#8203;sentry/electron\":\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:8:13:\n              8 │   \"exports\": {\n                ╵              ^\n\n          None of the conditions provided (\"require\", \"module\") match any of the currently active conditions\n          (\"browser\", \"default\", \"import\"):\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:16:14:\n              16 │     \"./main\": {\n                 ╵               ^\n\n          Consider enabling the \"module\" condition if this package expects it to be enabled.

It looks like the intent in this case was to use the standard `import` condition instead. This specific change wasn't suggested here because this error message is for package consumers, not package authors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine-npm</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/compare/v4.0.2...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.0.1...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.0`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.8.0...v5.9.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **web:** add a config item to web，let the developer can select whether enable the html cache ([#&#8203;3110](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3110)) ([b30ba81](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b30ba81b86d3fa11a18bdb32a7adf162f16794e0))\n\nVerdaccio cache the initial HTML render to improve performance, this might be not a required in some cases, the new property `web.html_cache`  disable this optimization. by [@&#8203;Tiny-Fendy](https://togithub.com/Tiny-Fendy)\n\n    web:\n      html_cache: false\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **deps:** update dependency [@&#8203;verdaccio/ui-theme](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/ui-theme) to v6.0.0-6-next.23 ([#&#8203;3106](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3106)) ([b963f7d](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b963f7db2a2273983c0d5b4792a84601be732823)) by [@&#8203;juanpicado](https://togithub.com/juanpicado)\n\n> The UI is being shared between V5 and V6 (for easy maintenance) but some features are partially enabled for V5.\n\nThe search component has been improved for V6, but for V5 is does not show all the potential but is able to display the description of the package and the **latest** published version on search private packages.

Some max_old_space_size settings automatically crashed before the upgrade, but now I can't serve or build my app at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nIn V12.2.9, I could serve and build my app with 10gb or more of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, I have gone from 12.2.9 and being able to serve and build my app without issue to 13.3.2 and not being able to serve or build my app with up to 40gb of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have either gotten a mixture of scavenge and mark-sweep related messages about the JavaScript heap or when using multiples of 8gb (8192, 16384) and a couple other random memory limits, I get this error (with no other information):\r\n`<--- Last few GCs --->\r\n\r\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Fatal javascript OOM in GC during deserialization\r\n#`\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly small sized app (<60mb w/o node modules) with a large amount of processing power. There's almost no starting data, but it pulls in large amounts of data (manufacturing schedules in up to 5 year horizons; average of 35 designs per scenario; 13 data parameters per design) and performs analysis and utilizes Excel libraries (mostly Infragistics) for display.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI am and have been running with `node --max_old_space_size=10240 --report-on-fatalerror node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng s -o` (up to 40000). I would suggest that a small app with a lot of processing power built in 12.2.9 and then upgraded to 13.3.2 would reproduce this issue. It may require using some Infragistics components (data-grid, spreadsheet, chart), but I'm not sure since I've had IG in my build since I started it about 1.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nMy

Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI upgraded a big project to have ssr and the app loads properly in the browser, but on the server there are a lot of console errors about unmatched routes. All of them have to do with `.js.map` files it seems. Like `input.js.map`, `clipboard.js.map`, `ngrx-store-localstorage.js.map` and other .map files from the libraries used in the project. I thought at first it was an express-engine related error that it can't match requests for those lib files, but I added `server.use((err, req, res, next) => { console.error('err :)');  });` to the server and it is never called, furthermore the text in the error is very \"angular\" like.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe project is too big and tight together to extract and reproduce with any similar results.

the publishing script for the previous release. Publishing again.\n\n### [`v0.14.33`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01433)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.32...v0.14.33)\n\n-   Fix a regression regarding `super` ([#&#8203;2158](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2158))\n\n    This fixes a regression from the previous release regarding classes with a super class, a private member, and a static field in the scenario where the static field needs to be lowered but where private members are supported by the configured target environment. In this scenario, esbuild could incorrectly inject the instance field initializers that use `this` into the constructor before the call to `super()`, which is invalid. This problem has now been fixed (notice that `this` is now used after `super()` instead of before):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      static FOO;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n      #foo;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    var _foo;\n    var Foo = class extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _foo, void 0);\n        super();\n      }\n    };\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    __publicField(Foo, \"FOO\");\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    var _foo;\n    var Foo = class extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        __privateAdd(this, _foo, void 0);\n      }\n    };\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    __publicField(Foo, \"FOO\");\n    ```\n\n    During parsing, esbuild scans the class and makes certain decisions about the class such as whether to lower all static fields, whether to lower each private member, or whether calls to `super()` need to be tracked and adjusted. Previously esbuild made two passes through the class members to compute this information. However, with the new `super()` call lowering logic added in the previous release, we now need three passes to capture the whole dependency chain for this case: 1) lowering static fields requires 2) lowering private members which requires 3) adjusting `super()` calls.\n\n    The reason lowering static fields requires lowering private members is because lowering static fields moves their initializers outside of the class body, where they can't access private members anymore. Consider this code:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      get #foo() {}\n      static bar = new Foo().#foo\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We can't just lower static fields without also lowering private members, since that causes a syntax error:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      get #foo() {}\n    }\n    Foo.bar = new Foo().#foo;\n    ```\n\n    And the reason lowering private members requires adjusting `super()` calls is because the injected private member initializers use `this`, which is only accessible after `super()` calls in the constructor.\n\n-   Fix an issue with `--keep-names` not keeping some names ([#&#8203;2149](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2149))\n\n    This release fixes a regression with `--keep-names` from version 0.14.26. PR [#&#8203;2062](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2062) attempted to remove superfluous calls to the `__name` helper function by omitting calls of the form `__name(foo, \"foo\")` where the name of the symbol in the first argument is equal to the string in the second argument. This was assuming that the initializer for the symbol would automatically be assigned the expected `.name` property by the JavaScript VM, which turned out to be an incorrect assumption. To fix the regression, this PR has been reverted.\n\n    The assumption is true in many cases but isn't true when the initializer is moved into another automatically-generated variable, which can sometimes be necessary during the various syntax transformations that esbuild does. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      static get #foo() { return Foo.name }\n      static get foo() { return this.#foo }\n    }\n    let Bar = Foo\n    Foo = { name: 'Bar' }\n    console.log(Foo.name, Bar.name)\n    ```\n\n    This code should print `Bar Foo`. With `--keep-names --target=es6` that code is lowered by esbuild into the following code (omitting the helper function definitions for brevity):\n\n    ```js\n    var _foo, foo_get;\n    const _Foo = class {\n      static get foo() {\n        return __privateGet(this, _foo, foo_get);\n      }\n    };\n    let Foo = _Foo;\n    __name(Foo, \"Foo\");\n    _foo = new WeakSet();\n    foo_get = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ __name(function() {\n      return _Foo.name;\n    }, \"#foo\");\n    __privateAdd(Foo, _foo);\n    let Bar = Foo;\n    Foo = { name: \"Bar\" };\n    console.log(Foo.name, Bar.name);\n    ```\n\n    The injection of the automatically-generated `_Foo` variable is necessary to preserve the semantics of the captured `Foo` binding for methods defined within the class body, even when the definition needs to be moved outside of the class body during code transformation. Due to a JavaScript quirk, this binding is immutable and does not change even if `Foo` is later reassigned. The PR that was reverted was incorrectly removing the call to `__name(Foo, \"Foo\")`, which turned out to be necessary after all in this case.\n\n-   Print some large integers using hexadecimal when minifying ([#&#8203;2162](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2162))\n\n    When `--minify` is active, esbuild will now use one fewer byte to represent certain large integers:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = 123456787654321;\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    x=123456787654321;\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    x=0x704885f926b1;\n    ```\n\n    This works because a hexadecimal representation can be shorter than a decimal representation starting at around 10<sup>12</sup> and above.\n\n    *This optimization made me realize that there's probably an opportunity to optimize printed numbers for smaller gzipped size instead of or in addition to just optimizing for minimal uncompressed byte count. The gzip algorithm does better with repetitive sequences, so for example `0xFFFFFFFF` is probably a better representation than `4294967295` even though the byte counts are the same. As far as I know, no JavaScript minifier does this optimization yet. I don't know enough about how gzip works to know if this is a good idea or what the right metric for this might be.*\n\n-   Add Linux ARM64 support for Deno ([#&#8203;2156](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2156))\n\n    This release adds Linux ARM64 support to esbuild's [Deno](https://deno.land/) API implementation, which allows esbuild to be used with Deno on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.1.1`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1311-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1310v1311-2022-04-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.1.0...v13.1.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_pkg</summary>\n\n### [`v0.7.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Release-070)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0)\n\n#### New Features\n\n-   Make the .bzl files available as input to a bzl_library ([#&#8203;567](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/567))\n-   Allow pkg_files.strip_prefix to work on tree artifact without having to use `renames`.\n-   Add @&#8203;rules_license style license declarations ([#&#8203;508](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/508))\n-   Better looking [documentation](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_pkg/0.7.0/reference.html)\n-   Add `artifact_name` to `print_relnotes` ([#&#8203;541](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/541))\n-   pkg\\_{deb,rpm,tar,zip} are now available via individual .bzl files, so you\n    only need to load what you actually need.\n-   Add tree artifact support to pkg_zip ([#&#8203;537](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/537))\n-   symlink support to pkg_zip ([#&#8203;499](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/499))\n\n#### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   Get rid of the long deprecated archive_name and extension from pkg_zip.

The changes were largely informed by implementing `material/dialog`, `material-experimental/mdc-dialog` and `material/bottom-sheet` using the new API, however the API can be used directly without having to be wrapped. Overview of the changes:\r\n* The classes for the dialog container, dialog config and dialog data aren't provided using DI anymore. The previous approach could've been a problem for apps that use multiple different versions of a CDK-based dialog.\r\n* Several fixes from the Material dialog that were never backported to the CDK version have been incorporated.\r\n* All animations and styles have been removed from the CDK dialog since they were going to be difficult to override by users. Custom animations can be achieved by extending the dialog container class.\r\n* The public API has been cleaned up to avoid some of the issues that were inherited from the Material dialog.\r\n* A demo has been added to the dev app.\r\n\r\nExample of how the new APIs was used to implement the Material components: https://github.com/crisbeto/material2/commit/446a5520f1a0357612a9cc2d9e0c38b506665fb9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24759","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/dialog): rewrite experimental dialog\" (#24759)"},{"Id":"1199133300","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-10T18:25:26","Actor":"Michael-Doner","Number":"24758","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): fix slider jumps back while dragging","State":"open","Body":"Fix a bug in the Angular Material `slider` component where slider jumps back while the user is dragging the slider and the sliders value gets updated manually somewhere else at the same time.\r\n\r\nFixes #19842\r\n\r\nI saw the issue and I thought I'd tackle it, @crisbeto had also worked on it a long time ago, but there was no pull request merged yet if I see it correctly and since then something has changed in the code a bit.

steals the focus back, and the first header of the first tabs becomes the active htmlelement on the page.\r\nTherefor I cannot properly set focus on my input element.\r\n\r\nI am not very familiair

In a simple example it seems to work.\r\n\r\nIn a our application it doens't.\r\n\r\nDifferences are perhaps we have a tabgroup with 2 tabs. Both of the tabs contain a control.\r\nthe first control contains a form with the input field.\r\n\r\nI have a screenshot that could explain a lot about what i think is wrong:\r\nhttps://snipboard.io/EtQguw.jpg\r\n\r\nAs you can see I have a method in the component of the first tab.\r\nIt focusses on the input field, and registers a 'blur' handler. Which triggers moments after we set the focus.\r\nIn the callstack you can see the problem. I just don't know what triggers it..\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect components to not steal focus, or if they do have an event that says 'now i'm done stealing focus'\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nafter all the events of the tabgroup are done, something triggers a focus steal.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material:13.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(tabcontrol): tabcontrol (the header) steals focus since 13.3.0\" (#24748)"},{"Id":"1195498371","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-07T04:18:04","Actor":"ducvu212","Number":"24746","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Cannot use material components inside remote project which created by nx","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have a project which use Microfrontend architecture by NX. \r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAfter i create remote project by command `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:app dashboard --mfe --mfeType=host --routing=true`\r\nInside project dashboard i generate component by using command `nx g c list`\r\nAfter that, i copy example in material home page (https://material.angular.io/components/list/overview#list-overview) but it show error \r\n`error NG8001: 'mat-list-item' is not a known element:\r\n1.

dialog when close animation does not run","State":"open","Body":"Currently the dialog's cleanup logic is tied to its exit animation completing and the close animation starting. This usually isn't a problem since by default the dialog is attached to the application ref, however if the consumer has set a viewContainerRef and that ref is destroyed before animation even starts, the exit animation event will never fire. \r\n\r\nDescription of the problem from https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17947.\r\n\r\nThese changes add an _onExit observable to MatDialogContainer that emits when the container is destroyed or the close animation ended. Similar implementation as in MatSnackBarContainer.\r\n\r\nThis code also fixes a potential memory leak.\r\nIf the MatDialogContainer is destroyed before the animation is complete, containerInstance._animationStateChanged will never return a value, take(1) will never complete, and therefore the subscriptions will never complete.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17891.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to get rid of the _closeFallbackTimeout in the MatDialogRef since the work is now done in the subsequent subscription.\r\nBut I didn't manage to adjust the \"should return the current state of the dialog\" test.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24739","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/dialog): adding fallback to clean dialog when close animation does not run\" (#24739)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-04-13T03:30:03.1264402Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2189}

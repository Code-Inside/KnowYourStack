I [asked on the Angular Discord](https://discord.com/channels/748677963142135818/749140853921939507/1254227088756576289) where to post and this was the best guess.\r\n\r\nAngular uses [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) for its internal linting ([`tslint.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/49b2e65bfb097b25da09870ca8a07650812e3d68/tslint.json)) right now, although [TSLint was deprecated years ago](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534). TSLint doesn't support all new TypeScript features and hasn't been actively worked on since 2020. Its replacement is [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io).\r\n\r\nSome related issues & PRs from searching [`tslint in:title`](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues?q=tslint+in%3Atitle):\r\n* #37843 -> https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13732: user-facing, not the same as this one\r\n* #42639: user-facing, not the same as this one\r\n* #42820: only part of the way\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose incrementally switching over to ESLint. One common strategy many repositories go with is:\r\n\r\n1. Add ESLint separately from TSLint, integrated into the same build processes\r\n    * Tip: https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint\r\n3. Remove old _built-in_ rules from the TSLint config and replace them with their new ESLint equivalents\r\n    * Tip: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config is the standard helper there\r\n4. Remove old _custom_ and _plugin_ rules from the TSLint config and rewrite and/or replace them with new custom and/or plugin equivalents\r\n    * Tip: for anything that can be generalized, this is a great time for adding a new or existing `eslint-plugin-*` package!\r\n5. Once there are no more TSLint rules in use, remove it altogether\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to help with this! \"Killing TSLint\" is IMO helpful for the ecosystem: both to get projects on the latest+greatest tooling, and to help get more community input into ESLint + typescript-eslint.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI suppose Angular could stay on TSLint in perpetuity, which would be a real bummer. Or even fork the old TSLint codebase - structural issues and all.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be a linter besides ESLint. There are some Rust-based ones such as [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), [`deno lint`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/linter), and [Oxc / `oxlint`](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) - though none yet support [linting with type information](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting) yet. Alternately, [tsslint](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/tsslint) is also in development, though it's not clear that it's quite the same maturity yet as the others.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Google still uses TSLint internally, and having this public angular/angular repo also use TSLint has some nice benefits for tooling. It'd be great to know if that's the case, and if so, whether an initiative to migrate the tooling over to a newer tool would be desirable + feasible.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56562","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Internal repo tooling: use ESLint instead of the deprecated TSLint\" (#56562)"},{"Id":"2368811681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-23T18:04:44","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56561","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): Add testing for defer error block","State":"open","Body":"On top of #56559: \r\n\r\nIn #56558 it was raised that we used an devMode function in a prod scope. \r\nThis commit adds a test when an defer error block is missing in devMode and prodMode ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56561","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(core): Add testing for defer error block\" (#56561)"},{"Id":"2368809786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-23T18:02:40","Actor":"MGX-CODING","Number":"56560","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow transform functions into input signals","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nAllow the use of transform functions into input signals\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```typescript\r\nimport { Directive, booleanAttribute, input } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Directive({ selector: 'input' } })\r\nexport class InputDirective {\r\n  public required = input<boolean>(false, { transform: booleanAttribute });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManually making it for now","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56560","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow transform functions into input signals\" (#56560)"},{"Id":"2368518520","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-23T11:41:40","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56559","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): prevent calling devMode only function on `@defer` error.","State":"open","Body":"`getTemplateLocationDetails()` is a devMode only function and should be guarded by `ngDevMode` or invoking it will throw an error.\r\n\r\nfixes #56558\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56559","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): prevent calling devMode only function on `@defer` error.\" (#56559)"},{"Id":"2368504621","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-23T11:04:52","Actor":"LanderBeeuwsaert","Number":"56558","RawContent":null,"Title":"'Must never be called in production mode'","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWe log errors our users are getting.

Change the behavior: Adjust the existing teardown configuration to allow more flexibility in how components are destroyed before or after each test. This could involve changing the type check to accommodate more use cases.\r\n\r\n2. Add support for a destroyBeforeEach option: Introduce a new option destroyBeforeEach in the teardown configuration. This would allow explicit control over the destruction behavior, enabling developers to configure whether the component should be destroyed before each test, after each test, or not at all.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\n- Flexibility: Developers will have more control over the lifecycle of components during testing.\r\n- Maintainability: Reduces the need for hacks or workarounds, making the test configurations cleaner and more maintainable.\r\n- Improved Testing Experience: Allows for more precise setup and teardown processes, improving the reliability and efficiency of tests.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe hack we have in place works for now, but would love to see this get baked into the framework!\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.

Open the example [provided in Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ywl3wm-hddgcz?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbutton-toggle-overview-example.html)\r\n2. Set the focus on the mat-button-toggle component. (e.g. Press tab until you reach it, or simply click on the first item)\r\n3. Use the arrow keys (either left/right or up/down) to navigate through the items.\r\n4. Observe that the disabled button receives focus and gets selected.\r\n\r\nExtra notes:\r\nWhile the selection is on the disabled item, if you hit Space or Enter the selection will move back to the previous active item.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBy using the arrow keys, the selection should rotate around the active buttons and ignore the disabled ones.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe selection allows selecting a disabled button, and once selected, it cannot move the selection further. When attempting to move back, the selection jumps over one item.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, MacOS\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.5\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, material-experimental\r\n... material-moment-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button-toggle): Disabled buttons are not ignored in radio pattern interaction for single select\" (#29304)"},{"Id":"2368378162","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-23T07:09:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29303","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/progress-bar): simplify structural styles","State":"open","Body":"Reworks the progress bar styles to be simpler and easier to maintain.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29303","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/progress-bar): simplify structural styles\" (#29303)"},{"Id":"2367900517","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-22T16:39:04","Actor":"smilThakur","Number":"29302","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Tabs): Box-shadow hidden","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\napplying box shadow the the content of any tab does not show due to inner css of overflow hidden and width 100%, adding margin reduced the size of the content which looks mis-align compared to tab icons\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/rs9pc4?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. add box-shadow to content 1 div and observe\r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ntoo able to see the box-shadow\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nbox-shadow gets hideen\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18\r\n- CDK/Material: 18\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29302","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Tabs): Box-shadow hidden\" (#29302)"},{"Id":"2367859989","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-22T14:47:55","Actor":"angelaki","Number":"29301","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(mat-datepicker): Allow mat-datepicker to be always visible","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nRight now the datepicker shows only up on clicking the toggle button (or implementing some own logic).

present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am shipping my Angular app using Material inside an APK as a TWA. It should be compatible with Android TV so I am testing the behaviour on Chromecast 2 using the dpad controller. Only available controls are the 4 directional arrows with Back and Enter.\r\nMy first page has a mat-tab-nav-bar at the top. On page load, the Chromecast browser focuses the first element and then let the user navigate in the page only using the previously listed controls. \r\nAs mat tabs enables keyboard navigation, it is switching tabs focus with arrow keys and changing active tab with Enter. But because dpads is missing Tab key, it becomes impossible to focus out the tabs and click on next elements.\r\nWe would need a way to configure the mat tabs to focus to next elements with arrows when last element has been reached instead of looping back to the first tab. That would allow dpad to navigate to the rest of the page.\r\nAny known hack to make this work would be more than welcome!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples#tab-group-align\r\nSteps to reproduce the same behaviour in a browser:\r\n1. Use tab to enter focus on first tabs bar\r\n2.

In the last comment linked, it was said that 'By keeping the ivy internals private we can be more agile going forward.' Does the same situation still apply in 16+? Must we have no API such that full Ivy may be used when publishing libraries?\r\n\r\nIf all libraries must be compiled in `partial` mode forever, `full` mode being only available through workarounds, why are there multiple modes? Why make an option available if it will never be allowed?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis is more of a question than a critique. Ivy compilation was obviously designed to be more efficient, so if possible, the option should be made available.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`partial` mode can be used in perpetuity. If this alternative is chosen, maybe the existence of `full` mode should be reconsidered.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54205","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"v16+: Add option to publish a library built with ivy\" (#54205)"},{"Id":"2113091343","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-01T18:54:59","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54204","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Remove the edit button from AIO","State":"closed","Body":"As a move to reduce PRs toward AIO we drop the edit button and recommend users to use ADEV instead and make suggestions there.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54204","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): Remove the edit button from AIO\" (#54204)"},{"Id":"2113066939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-01T17:39:49","Actor":"mgechev","Number":"54203","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simplify the navigation for in-depth guides","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nCurrently the list contains an overwhelming amount of topics and we should consider simplifying it.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54203","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Simplify the navigation for in-depth guides\" (#54203)"},{"Id":"2113001155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-01T17:05:25","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"54202","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency eslint-plugin-jsdoc to v48","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [eslint-plugin-jsdoc](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) | devDependencies | major | [`46.8.2` -> `48.0.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/46.8.2/48.0.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc (eslint-plugin-jsdoc)</summary>\n\n### [`v48.0.4`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/releases/tag/v48.0.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v48.0.3...v48.0.4)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **`require-description-complete-sentence`:** capture multiple newlines as \"paragraphs\"; fixes [#&#8203;1193](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/1193) ([c5f203a](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/commit/c5f203ade7b76a7d8d69735b524dfeda130d508c))\n\n### [`v48.0.3`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/releases/tag/v48.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v48.0.2...v48.0.3)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **`require-jsdoc`:** ensure children of TS type reference and parameter instantiation can be exports; fixes [#&#8203;1186](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/1186) ([7461e01](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/commit/7461e0182827af0c6355dfeec50315953c6fb3de))\n-   **`require-param`:** skip `this` parameter in checks (when followed by destructured content); fixes [#&#8203;1190](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/1190) ([0cd761b](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/commit/0cd761b504b3f07acd6c5045e2fa9b5a0cb27e2c))\n-   update devDeps.

In that source file, `value` is typed in the constructor code as `any` (as seen with the input and return types of the `normalizeTriggerValue` function). In the field declarations of the class however, it is typed as a `string`. Likewise the `input` property for the constructor is typed as `any`.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nWhen looking through the documentation, I was looking for what inputs are accepted for the animation trigger binding. All I could find was this excerpt from the Introduction page:\r\n\r\n> Then, you can bind the trigger to a template expression using standard Angular property binding syntax as shown below, where triggerName is the name of the trigger, and expression evaluates to a defined animation state.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nIn my project, I have on the lint rule that requires all functions to have a defined return type. That proved difficult when I was trying to define functions that return the state name and animation params like so:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@HostBinding('@rotateIcon')\r\nget rotateIconBinding() {\r\n  return this.rotateDegrees === 0 ? this.getDefaultAnimationState : this.getRotatedAnimationState;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected get getDefaultAnimationState() {\r\n  return { value: 'default', params: { rotateDegrees: this.rotateDegrees } };\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected get getRotatedAnimationState() {\r\n  return { value: 'rotated', params: { rotateDegrees: this.rotateDegrees } };\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nAny (preferably all) of the following would help alleviate the issue for me or others that are struggling with the state of the current animation docs:\r\n\r\n1. Create a type definition for the `input` property of `StateValue` like so:\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  import { AnimationOptions } from '@angular/animations';\r\n\r\n  export type AnimationStateInput = string | ({ value: string } & AnimationOptions);\r\n  ```\r\n2. Add a section in the Introduction docs explaining what inputs can be provided (aka the name or an object defined like step 1)\r\n\r\nThe above solutions would fix the documentation problem, but it would also be fantastic if there was some sort of IDE support that could detect available animation states so that when you work with animations, it detects issues at compile time.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No

The development server now has a specific `prebundle` option to allow more control over prebundling while still allowing other forms of caching within the Angular CLI. The `prebundle` option can be a boolean value of `true` or `false` that will enable or disable prebundling, respectively. Additionally, the option also has an object long-form. This long-form enables prebundling and currently contains one property named `exclude`. The `exclude` property supports cases where a package should not be prebundled and rather should be bundled directly into the application code. These cases are not common but can happen based on project specific requirements. If the `prebundle` option is enabled when using the `browser` builder or any other Webpack-based builder, it will be ignored as the Webpack-based development server does not contain such functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow control of Vite-based development server

I prepared a simple repo here: https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss . The crucial part is here https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss/blob/master/src/app/scss/utils.scss .`utils.css` is file that is being imported into `app.component.scss`. Relative path from `utils.scss` to `angular.png` is `../../angular.png` and when it is directly used inside `url()` function, it works. However if i define SCSS variable with the same path-value I'm getting error (path can't be resolved), also when it is changed to path relative to app.component.scss (`../angular.png`) it works again. \r\n\r\nIs the new behaviour intentional? \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Path declared in SCSS variable is incorrectly resolved\" (#27007)"},{"Id":"2107838156","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-31T16:51:16","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26995","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add JSON build logs when using the application builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis change implements the capability to display JSON build logs in the terminal instead of a format readable by humans.

Starting from Angular 15  I need to put everything together. This is not something I want because I like to keep my CSS files separately.\r\n\r\nSee image below. \r\n\r\nThe order of the import does not matter, I still get the error. What I want is for this to work but it seems I need to import tailwind/base to each file separately but that creates some overrides if I import it several times.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is to use postcss-import and change the order of plugins for tailwind. However, for that, we would need to use webpack which we didn't have to in Angular 14.

updating to Angular 21","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.12\n\n### Description\n\nWhen updating my app to Angular 21, all is fine, _except_ my unit tests. There are now many, many occurrences of the `NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`, which were not present before the update.\n\nMy app still heavily relies on zone.js for change detection. I also still use the older `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` builder. I am working on upgrading both, but that process is gradual and will still take significant effort.\n\nI discovered [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/angular/comments/1p8suok/upgrading_from_angular_20_21_app_works_but_tests/) where someone describes the exact same issue (in way more detail). This also includes a workaround: globally \"patch\" `TestBed.configureTestingModule` to always `provideZoneChangeDetection()`. As I also indicated in my comment over there, this does work, but feels too hacky and I cannot imagine this being the \"official\" recommended solution. Is there anything else I can do?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIn principle:\n1. Have a zone.js-based Angular project, not using OnPush change detection (at least not everywhere)\n2. Run `ng test`\n3. Observe NG0100 errors\n\nI am unfortunately unable to submit (parts of) my actual source code. Will try to see if I can make a minimal reproduction later.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.1\nAngular           : 21.0.2\nNode.js           : 24.11.0\nPackage Manager   : yarn 4.12.0\nOperating System  : darwin arm64\n\n┌────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                            │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular-devkit/architect          │ 0.2100.1          │ 0.2100.1          │\n│ @angular-devkit/build-angular      │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular-devkit/core               │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular-devkit/schematics         │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular/animations                │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/cdk                       │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular/cli                       │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular/common                    │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/compiler                  │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli              │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/core                      │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/forms                     │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/language-service          │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/material                  │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular/material-date-fns-adapter │ 21.0.1            │ 21.0.1            │\n│ @angular/platform-browser          │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/platform-browser-dynamic  │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ @angular/router                    │ 21.0.2            │ 21.0.2            │\n│ rxjs                               │ 7.8.2             │ 7.8.2             │\n│ typescript                         │ 5.9.3             │ 5.9.3             │\n│ zone.js                            │ 0.15.1            │ 0.15.1            │\n└────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32047","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Many NG0100 errors in Karma unit tests after updating to Angular 21\" (#32047)"},{"Id":"3699755354","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T17:41:49","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32049","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): conditionally provide Zone.js change detection in the built-in test main file","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nPrior to this change Zone.js change detection provider was never added.\r\n\r\nCloses #32047\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32049","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): conditionally provide Zone.js change detection in the built-in test main file\" (#32049)"},{"Id":"3699540592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T17:33:13","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32046","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): inject testing polyfills in Karma unit-test executor","State":"closed","Body":"This commit ensures that testing polyfills (specifically `zone.js/testing`) are correctly injected when using the new unit-test builder with the Karma runner.

Create or use an existing Angular workspace with CLI 21.0.1\n2. Run `ng generate library my-library`\n3. Attempt to build the project or library\n4. Observe TypeScript compilation error\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe generated `tsconfig.lib.json` should be valid and compile without errors. If `\"inlineSources\": true` is included, then either `\"sourceMap\": true` or `\"inlineSourceMap\": true` must also be present.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe generated `tsconfig.lib.json` contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../../out-tsc/lib\",\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"declarationMap\": true,\n    \"inlineSources\": true,\n    \"types\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis produces the following TypeScript error:\n```\nOption 'inlineSources' can only be used when either option '--inlineSourceMap' or option '--sourceMap' is provided.\n```\n\n### Proposed Solution\nAdd `\"sourceMap\": true` to the generated `compilerOptions`:\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../../out-tsc/lib\",\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"declarationMap\": true,\n    \"inlineSources\": true,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"types\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Workaround\nManually add `\"sourceMap\": true` to the `compilerOptions` in `projects/<library-name>/tsconfig.lib.json`.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create or use an existing Angular workspace with CLI 21.0.1\n2. Run `ng generate library my-library`\n3. Attempt to build the project or library\n4.

The StackBlitz above compares the three form types (Template-driven, Reactive, Signal forms).\n2. The first two timepickers (Template-Driven & Reactive), turn red if you input an invalid value.\n3. The third timepicker (Signal form), doesn't turn red if you input an invalid value.\n4. In my project it also doesn't turn red when the field is clicked and blurred while empty, even though I've added a `required(fields.startTime);` to the signal form, and it's adding an asterisk to the form-field indicating that it's required. (For some reason this specific point isn't reproducing in the stackblitz above.)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect two things:\n- (a) When the field contains an invalid value like \"123\" or \"abc\", it should should have a red outline and the form should be \"invalid\".\n- (b) When the field is empty and it's clicked then blurred, and there's a `required(...)` validator, it should turn red.\n\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere is no basic validation for empty/invalid values when using signal forms `[field]` with `<mat-timepicker>`.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.0.3\n- CDK/Material: 21.0.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32497","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/timepicker): Usage with signal forms validation required & valid\" (#32497)"},{"Id":"3705334527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-08T08:54:33","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32496","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): combine style resets","State":"open","Body":"Prior to #31522 we had two places with style resets, because the user could either use a custom theme or one of the pre-built ones.

[`v0.14.48`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01448)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.47...v0.14.48)\n\n-   Enable using esbuild in Deno via WebAssembly ([#&#8203;2323](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2323))\n\n    The native implementation of esbuild is much faster than the WebAssembly version, but some people don't want to give Deno the `--allow-run` permission necessary to run esbuild and are ok waiting longer for their builds to finish when using the WebAssembly backend. With this release, you can now use esbuild via WebAssembly in Deno. To do this you will need to import from `wasm.js` instead of `mod.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    import * as esbuild from 'https://deno.land/x/esbuild@v0.14.48/wasm.js'\n    const ts = 'let test: boolean = true'\n    const result = await esbuild.transform(ts, { loader: 'ts' })\n    console.log('result:', result)\n    ```\n\n    Make sure you run Deno with `--allow-net` so esbuild can download the WebAssembly module. Using esbuild like this starts up a worker thread that runs esbuild in parallel (unless you call `esbuild.initialize({ worker: false })` to tell esbuild to run on the main thread). If you want to, you can call `esbuild.stop()` to terminate the worker if you won't be using esbuild anymore and you want to reclaim the memory.\n\n    Note that Deno appears to have a bug where background WebAssembly optimization can prevent the process from exiting for many seconds. If you are trying to use Deno and WebAssembly to run esbuild quickly, you may need to manually call `Deno.exit(0)` after your code has finished running.\n\n-   Add support for font file MIME types ([#&#8203;2337](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2337))\n\n    This release adds support for font file MIME types to esbuild, which means they are now recognized by the built-in local web server and they are now used when a font file is loaded using the `dataurl` loader. The full set of newly-added file extension MIME type mappings is as follows:\n\n    -   `.eot` => `application/vnd.ms-fontobject`\n    -   `.otf` => `font/otf`\n    -   `.sfnt` => `font/sfnt`\n    -   `.ttf` => `font/ttf`\n    -   `.woff` => `font/woff`\n    -   `.woff2` => `font/woff2`\n\n-   Remove `\"use strict\";` when targeting ESM ([#&#8203;2347](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2347))\n\n    All ES module code is automatically in strict mode, so a `\"use strict\";` directive is unnecessary. With this release, esbuild will now remove the `\"use strict\";` directive if the output format is ESM. This change makes the generated output file a few bytes smaller:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    'use strict'\n    export let foo = 123\n\n    // Old output (with --format=esm --minify)\n    \"use strict\";let t=123;export{t as foo};\n\n    // New output (with --format=esm --minify)\n    let t=123;export{t as foo};\n    ```\n\n-   Attempt to have esbuild work with Deno on FreeBSD ([#&#8203;2356](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2356))\n\n    Deno doesn't support FreeBSD, but it's possible to build Deno for FreeBSD with some additional patches on top. This release of esbuild changes esbuild's Deno installer to download esbuild's FreeBSD binary in this situation.

We come from three projects that rely on parse5 — namely [Cheerio](https://togithub.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), [rehype](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).\n\n**We need your support to continue the project!** If you care about parse5, please support us financially on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/parse5).\n\nHeadlining features of this release are ES Modules, TypeScript, and performance improvements: 7.0.0 is 45% faster than 6.0.1 with default options, and 167% faster with location information enabled (for the `bench/perf` benchmark, on an M1 Mac). Version 7.0.0 is a revamp of every part of the library. There are too many changes to list them all here, so here is a high-level overview:\n\n##### Breaking: ESM\n\nAll of parse5’s packages are now ECMAScript Modules. We are providing dual packages for `parse5` and `parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter` for now (see [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418) and [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496)).\n\nTo migrate, please read [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) on how to update. Note that private internals are no longer available; instead, everything that you need should be imported from the main package.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j) in [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/351)*\n\n##### Breaking: TypeScript\n\nThe codebase has been ported to TypeScript. This helped uncover a number of subtle logic bugs, such as [`dc4e269`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/dc4e269022ebbae0767d8f790a29d6be1835fe1e), [`b4b5d4a`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/b4b5d4ad6f90b3c9fd03a90e2ed5267929979a11), or [`a0aff95`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/a0aff9578bb44511bc169c1d7f9e2f2780f7f8a0). TypeScript also helps us refactor with confidence and a lot of the changes in this release would have been much harder to do without it.\n\nTo migrate, please remove `@types/parse5*` as we now ship our own types.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;fb55](https://togithub.com/fb55) in [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362)*\n\n##### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   parse5 was caught up with the HTML spec, and parsing results might differ in edge-cases ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451))\n-   The `parse5-serializer-stream` package was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481)\n    -   To migrate, use the `serialize` function exported by `parse5`.\n-   The rewriting stream now splits very long text sections ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434)) and doesn’t escape text in special tags anymore ([#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/434)). If you worked around these issues before, you might have to update your code.\n-   The htmlparser2 adapter now uses `domhandler`’s node interface ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327) by [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound))\n    -   The format of the tree nodes has changed slightly; eg. some previous properties are now getters and setters, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are using deep imports for any parts of the codebase, you will likely encounter some breakages:\n\n<details><summary>Show internal changes</summary>\n\n-   The tokenizer now uses the state machine pattern from htmlparser2 [`5d7a780` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/5d7a780b70d3669def4c6bb20cbec816804d44a5)\n-   The token queue was replaced with callbacks ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419))\n-   The `OpenElementStack` now uses callbacks [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429)\n-   Mixins were removed (as part of [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362))\n    -   Location tracking now has a substantially lower overhead [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402)\n-   `getNextToken` was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461)\n-   The parser’s `_bootstrap` method was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384)\n-   We now drop chunks from the tokenizer right after they are emitted [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432)\n-   The serializer is no longer a class; instead, different serializer functions call on each other [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383)\n-   parse5 now uses the `entities` module for encoding and decoding entities, sharing maintenance & optimisation work with projects such as htmlparser2 ([`2b92054` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/2b9205458b9305de1406966568567ccfc1633fa1), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486))\n    -   `entities` adopted a variant of parse5’s approach of decoding entities. As a result, decoding performance is equivalent, while memory consumption is slightly lower.\n\n</details>\n##### Other changes\n\n-   **minor** add hooks for stack events to tree adapter interface [#&#8203;385](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/385)\n-   **minor** add support for fragments in `parse5-parser-stream` [#&#8203;487](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/487)\n-   **minor** add `serializeOuter` (like `.outerHTML`), `scriptingEnabled` option [#&#8203;383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/383)\n-   **patch** fix parsing of `<<` in comments parsed wrongly as `<!` ([#&#8203;326](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/326))\n-   **patch** fix position of `endTag` for mixed-case foreign elements ([#&#8203;353](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/353))\n-   **patch** fix end position of `html`, `body` ([#&#8203;436](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/436))\n-   docs: parse5 has a new documentation website at [`parse5.js.org`](http://parse5.js.org/) [#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/443)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\nThanks [@&#8203;anko](https://togithub.com/anko), [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound), [@&#8203;samouri](https://togithub.com/samouri), [@&#8203;alan-agius4](https://togithub.com/alan-agius4), and [@&#8203;pmdartus](https://togithub.com/pmdartus)!\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/compare/v6.0.1...v7.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

My use-case is that I am on a view with a calendar on a view showing an entire month. Since I am showing a month, picking a day is irrelevant\r\n\r\nTo get around the datepicker going to a day view when clicking on a month, you can add a function that runs on the `(monthSelected)` event and calls `datepicker.close()` when fired. This works, but it flashes the day view for a split second before closing. It should just close right away.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse the example at the very bottom of the official Material docs for the datepicker:\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/examples\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUse this example that uses Angular Material 8.2.3\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/angular/ekjvrbglvnb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdatepicker-views-selection-example.ts\r\n\r\nThe datepicker closes immediately upon selecting a month. \r\n\r\nThis is just one that I found when researching this issue. It is possible that versions later than this also work.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe datepicker switches to the day view and then closes.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25191","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): closing datepicker on monthSelected shows day view briefly\" (#25191)"},{"Id":"1288911449","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-29T15:37:49","Actor":"bonomiandreia","Number":"25189","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(DATAPICKER): Select ranges dates for years and months in only one datapicker.","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nSelect ranges dates for years and months too.\r\n\r\nExample:  if I want only select by years or month, I must NECESSARILY use two date pickers, one for start date and another for end date (I can't add two data pickers in my project).\r\nCurrently, I dont have a choice in angular material to use only one datapicker for the same use (at last, I didn't see this case of use in documentation). \r\nMy suggestion is there is ranges dates for years and months too, as days.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2020 ~ 2022 = 01/01/2020 to 01/01/2022\r\nmay ~ december = 01/05 to 01/12\r\n\r\nNow, I'm moving from library datapicker because this issue.

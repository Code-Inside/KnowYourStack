In our actual application, based on certain control values, we hide or show different components. We need the tabbing to follow the order of the components with the new DOM layout. \n\nWith `eventCoalescing` set to `false`, change detection occurs at the end of `keydown` being broadcast and the `keyup` event handler is invoked and focus is set to the new item dynamically rendered as desired.\n\nWith `eventCoalescing` set to `true`, focus is set to the wrong item due to the timing of when change detection is run. Also, the `keyup` event handler is never invoked.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-mfnhbni1?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nEvent listener never fired\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n \nAngular CLI: 19.0.7\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.7\n@angular/build               19.0.7\n@angular/cli                 19.0.7\n@schematics/angular          19.0.7\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1.

Focus is set on the `Reset` button\n6. `onKeyup` method is never invoked\n\n\nThen to see the desired behavior (with `eventCoalescing` off):\n\n1. Change `providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true })],` to `providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: false })],` (line 89)\n2. Wait for page to reload\n3. Put focus in the text field for `Item 1`\n4. Enter any non-blank value\n5. Hit tab\n6. Focus is set on the `Item 2` input element\n7. `onKeyup` method is fired as expected\n\nRelated issues:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57460\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57528","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59525","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Event coalescing fires events too late for desired browser focus traversal and sometimes fails to fire event listeners\" (#59525)"},{"Id":"2788494569","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-14T23:47:58","Actor":"atscott","Number":"59524","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Forward the tags for quick info from the type definition","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this commit, the tags from the type definition were dropped.

I have a setup where source (which is English) language is setup with no additional slug. Meaning that `/` or `/somepage` should get an English version. While other languages, for example German, do have a language slug: `/de`, `/de/somepage`.\n\nI was able to make the new engine work with German language fully and with English - only the home page (`/`). Any other English path (e.g. `/somepage`) results in `AngularNodeAppEngine` not being able to render anything.\n\nMy setup is also different from, what would you probably call, \"default\" in that locale `codes` are with region (e.g. de-DE), but `baseHrefs` are without the region part. This will be visible in `project.json` later.\n\nI will provide an excerpt from `project.json` and full `server.ts` here. If this won't be enough to understand my issue, I can create a reproduction project, but hopefully this will be enough 🙏.\n\n`project.json`:\n```\n\"i18n\": {\n    \"sourceLocale\": {\n      \"code\": \"en-US\",\n      \"baseHref\": \"/\"\n    },\n    \"locales\": {\n      \"de-DE\": {\n        \"translation\": \"src/locale/messages.de-DE.xlf\",\n        \"baseHref\": \"/de/\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n``` \nand `localize` is set to `true` for `build` option.\n\nHere is `server.ts`. It is basically the default one, but I have added two static file middlewares instead of the default one. With the default setup Angular will look for browser files in /de/ folder instead of /de-DE/ where they were actually generated.\n\n```\nimport {\n  AngularNodeAppEngine,\n  createNodeRequestHandler,\n  isMainModule,\n  writeResponseToNodeResponse,\n} from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { dirname, join, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport 'zone.js/node';\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\n\napp.use(\n  '/de',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'de-DE'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.use(\n  '/',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'en-US'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.get('/**', (req, res, next) => {\n  angularApp\n    .handle(req)\n    .then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next(),\n    )\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n  const port = process.env['PORT'] || 3000;\n\n  app.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n  });\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n\n```\n\nWhen I run the server with an English path that is not the home page (e.g. `/somepage`), I get the default Node.js \"Cannot Get...\" response, because the \"next()\" function is being triggered in the server meaning that Angular engine did not provide a meaningful response.\n```\n.then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next() <--- next is triggered\n    )\n```\n\nI went in to the source code of `AngularAppEngine` (`@angulr/ssr/fesm2022/ssr.mjs`) and I see that the empty response results from `getEntryPointExports` hitting the \n```\nif (!entryPoint) {\n    return undefined;\n}\n```\npart.\n\nI tried printing out the manifest (`this.manifest`) and this is what I get with the before mentioned `project.json` setup:\n```\n{\n  basePath: '/',\n  entryPoints: { '': [Function (anonymous)], de: [Function: de] }\n}\n```\nThe functions when stringified look like this:\n```\nAnonymous function: () => import('./en-US/main.server.mjs')\nNamed function 'de': () => import('./de-DE/main.server.mjs')\n```\n\nThe problem is that the `potentialLocale` parameter which comes from `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` function returns an empty string (which maps to the English bundle) only for the English home page. For other paths it returns whatever the path is. For `/somepage` it returns to \"somepage\" and then the \n```\nconst entryPoint = entryPoints[potentialLocale];\n```\nin `getEntryPointExports` obviously cannot find any matching entryPoint.\n `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` returns empty string `''` only for the home page (`/`).\nIf I change the code to default to the empty string entry point `''` the server works flawlessly, everything gets served as expected.\nThe German version works flawlessly by default because `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` is always able to extract `/de/` from the beginning of the url.\n\nSo my question is - is there something wrong with my setup? I cannot change the setup of having English url with no slug, because we would need to migrate all our english urls in a big project - it's just not doable. How can I accommodate my use case with `AngularAppEngine`?

counterparts.\n\nIt will bring minor but valuable improvements especially for newcomers :\n\n- Reduced file sizes and HTTP requests.\n- Greater control over font properties (e.g., weight, width).\n- Aligns with the latest web standards.\n\nThis change would enhance Angular Material’s efficiency, design capabilities, and relevance.\n\nHere is a quick example of new default font import proposal : \n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin />\n<link\n

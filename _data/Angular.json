This can mean changing the real URL of the browser during a test, updating the History state object, or any number of other stateful operations. This can result in a test unintentionally affecting other tests in the suite because the browser state does not usually get reset before the next test runs. Providing `MockPlatformLocation` by default prevents these types of accidental test leakages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, not providing `MockPlatformLocation` by default led to developers needing to add `RouterTestingModule` to their test suite to avoid the problems above. This module has spy `Location` providers which prevent those issues. This commit now makes `RouterTestingModule` obsolete. Developers can now just use `RouterModule.forRoot` or `provideRouter` directly in tests _without_ needing to learn to import additional test providers or modules.\r\n\r\nWith this, we should consider deprecating `RouterTestingModule` altogether and migrating developers to `RouterModule.forRoot` or `provideRouter` instead. There are some small differences between `SpyLocation` and `MockPlatformLocation` that might cause tests to fail after the migration (`MockPlatformLocation` is actually more correct in its behaviors). If this happens, we can advise developers to also add `provideLocationMocks()` to their test providers, which would re-provide the `SpyLocation` like before and should make the tests pass again.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: `MockPlatformLocation` is now provided by default in tests. Existing tests may have behaviors which rely on\r\n`BrowserPlatformLocation` instead. For example, direct access to the `window.history` in either the test or the component rather than going through the Angular APIs (`Location.getState()`). The quickest fix is to update the providers in the test suite to override the provider again `TestBed.configureTestingModule({providers: [{provide: PlatformLocation, useClass: BrowserPlatformLocation}]})`. The ideal fix would be to update the code to instead be compatible with `MockPlatformLocation` instead.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49137","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(testing): Provide MockPlatformLocation by default in BrowserTest…\" (#49137)"},{"Id":"1590754039","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-19T16:30:06","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"49136","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simplify ngtsc now that ngcc is gone","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits for various simplifications in the compiler that have been unlocked with the removal of ngcc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49136","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Simplify ngtsc now that ngcc is gone\" (#49136)"},{"Id":"1590600100","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-19T08:01:44","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"49135","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update AIO to TypeScript 4.9","State":"open","Body":"Updates AIO to the latest stable version of TypeScript as a prerequisite to drop support for 4.8.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49135","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update AIO to TypeScript 4.9\" (#49135)"},{"Id":"1590465633","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-18T21:19:19","Actor":"rockyessel","Number":"49134","RawContent":null,"Title":"added punctuation to list items","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\nClosing punctuation error in README.md\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [x] Other...

It's hard to understand (from the warning alone, and even after looking at #47988) in what way this is an issue\r\n- if the warning is necessary and something needs to be fixed for an upcoming change, maybe the warning could include a bit more information on how to do so? I suppose that most developers that are going to run into it will ask the same question. I'll gladly submit a PR to improve it if I get some guidance on what would need to be changed\r\n- if the warning is necessary, could it be displayed less often? because it is outputted dozens of times on some applications where I tested the RC\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/node-1bky4j?file=repro/src/app\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.0-rc.0\r\nNode: 16.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.0-rc.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.0-rc.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49116","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"router: `The ActivatedRoute has an invalid structure` warning improvements\" (#49116)"},{"Id":"1588404072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-16T23:53:35","Actor":"atscott","Number":"49117","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): Remove warning for an invalid ActivatedRoute","State":"closed","Body":"This warning was put in place to surface an error when developers use an ActivatedRoute with an invalid structure in tests.

This appears to be only in the 'flex' mat-table approach and not when using a native `<table>`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a mat-table without scoped CSS styles => row height is not 52px\r\n- Must use the 'flex' table approach and not native tables with directives\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSee this line from the [v15 migration docs](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-flex-basic-example.ts) under the `Table` component:\r\n\r\n    Row height is 52px instead of 48px.\r\n\r\nThat is the desired behavior for a table row per spec. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n#### Example from Angular docs (no scoped styles)\r\nIf you look at this stackblitz example from the docs [Basic use of `<mat-table>` (uses display flex)](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-basic) you will see an example which does not use [Scoped style customizations](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#scoping-style-customizations). \r\n\r\nThat particular example defines the mat styling (no wrapping selector) like this:\r\n\r\n     @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n\r\nThis mixin does indeed generate a `height:52px` selector as per spec, but it is overridden by a higher precedence selector - resulting in `height: unset`. The rows just end up at their 'natural' height. You can see that in this devtools screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"421\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219161097-fc0ed586-e074-4d29-90cf-1693c016f089.png\">\r\n\r\nThe higher precedence style appears to be coming from the [embedded scss styles in the Angular matTable component itself.](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/table/table.scss) \r\n\r\n#### Forked version with scoped styles\r\nNext I tried creating a [fork with scoped styles](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ohqraz-kxbm3v?file=src%2Ftheme.scss,src%2Findex.html) for the stackblitz page (which is how my own application is configured).\r\n\r\n    .my-styles \r\n    {\r\n       @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the scoped selector has a higher precedence resulting in a row height of 52px as per spec.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"416\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219168579-cdf1c48b-f842-4ac2-819c-6dde65b79a9a.png\">\r\n\r\nSo **without** scoped styles (as in the example stackblitz) the behavior is not to spec.\r\n\r\n#### Another mat-table example in the docs\r\nAnother example on the same page [Flex table where one column's cells has a greater height than others](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-flex-large-row) suggests using the following css to set the height of a column (the 'name' column).\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-column-name {\r\n  height: 100px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"389\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219173091-19f6ac49-9b9d-4524-af82-4eb2c68720fc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThat works in the stackblitz, but as soon as you add scoped styles it fails spectacularly because the cells are of height 100px and the containing row is of height 52px!\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nFor my own needs I actually **want** the unset behavior, with perhaps a min-height because my rows need to grow with their content. I can figure out a workaround for now.\r\n\r\nI wanted to raise this since I can't find any other issues mentioning it and the current examples are not to spec since they don't use scoped styles.\r\n\r\nNote: I've only observed this with mat-table-row heights (I only updated to v15 yesterday), but it is potentially a wider issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0 / 15.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Non scoped style customizations behave differently from Scoped style customizations (css precedence conflict)\" (#26628)"},{"Id":"1586073189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T15:38:49","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26627","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26627","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options\" (#26627)"},{"Id":"1585853109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T13:21:37","Actor":"marcramser","Number":"26626","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: Datepicker outside visible area when opened in dialog","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the mat-datepicker is opened in a component shown with the MatDialogRef on a small screen, the calendar picker is shown outside the visible area.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

This occurs after updating the two packages \"@angular-architects/module-federation\" and \"@angular-architects/module-federation-tools\" to version 18.0.4.\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'firstCreatePass')\r\n    at providersResolver (core.mjs:27484:15)\r\n    at definition.providersResolver (core.mjs:27745:24)\r\n    at N_ (remoteEntry.js:1:2842558)\r\n    at aS (remoteEntry.js:1:2842076)\r\n    at nE (remoteEntry.js:1:2919565)\r\n    at Bh (remoteEntry.js:1:2919719)\r\n    at Module.n_ (remoteEntry.js:1:2920554)\r\n    at template (907.b0dee35ac08d6609.js:1:5554)\r\n    at o0 (remoteEntry.js:1:2838321)\r\n    at g0 (remoteEntry.js:1:2846321)\r\n\r\nHowever, if I revert \"@angular-architects/module-federation\" and \"@angular-architects/module-federation-tools\" to version 17.0.8 (which I was using previously with Angular 17.3.5), I encounter a different error even though BrowserModule is already imported.\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: NG0402: A required Injectable was not found in the dependency injection tree.

However, once I upgrade my plugin to Angular 17.3.11, it stops working. After some debugging, I found that the issue seems to be related to the @angular/core and @angular/platform-browser packages.

This issue was discovered when trying to use resolved data as a resolver for the page title.\r\n\r\nIn general, dynamic titles often rely on some HTTP calls to produce meaningful titles, and the issue of using already resolved data comes up if we do not want to: \r\n\r\n1. repeat the same HTTP call twice\r\n2. move the dynamic title setup logic into a component\r\n\r\nIn this example, we have a resolver that resolves a product item, and then a dynamic title resolver that wants to reuse that resolved data. Which, of course, makes sense, as I already pulled the product data and just want to pluck the title of the product and use it as a title:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const productResolver: ResolveFn<Product> = ({ paramMap }) => {\r\n  console.log('resolving product');\r\n  const productService = inject(ProductService);\r\n  const id = paramMap.get('id') ?? 0;\r\n  return productService.getProductById(+id);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'product/:id',\r\n    component: ProductComponent,\r\n    title: () => {\r\n      const route = inject(ActivatedRoute);\r\n      return route.data.pipe(\r\n        // this was an attempt to \"wait\" for the data\r\n        // but it did not work, Observable never emits anything\r\n        // skipWhile((data) => {\r\n        //   return !data['product'];\r\n        // }),\r\n        map((data) => {\r\n          console.log(data?.['product']?.title ?? 'Default');\r\n          return data?.['product']?.title ?? 'Default';\r\n        })\r\n      );\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: { product: productResolver },\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I access the resolved data via parameters (`title: ({data}) => {}`), I get an empty object. But, and this is important, the `productResolver` works just fine and I am able to read the product data in the component via input binding.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-mfigyo?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception, just unexpected behavior\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.0\r\nNode: 18.20.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI am not entirely sure if this is a bug, could be intended behavior (all resolvers including the title resolver run in parallel, resulting in race conditions when trying to resolve the title). However, I would argue that running the title resolver *after* all other resolvers have finished would make more sense here. Also, if this is, in fact, the case, it is strange that even using `skipWhile` to wait does not seem to resolve the issue, it is as if the `data` Observable never emits for the title resolver, which makes me think this might even be a dependency injection issue (the title resolver gets a \"wrong\" `ActivatedRoute` instance)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57752","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Title resolvers in Routing don't have access to other resolved data\" (#57752)"},{"Id":"2516738198","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T15:07:39","Actor":"Fasteroid","Number":"57756","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Text legibility and accessibility","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\nThe new Angular Docs site could do with some improvements in accessibility related to text rendering.

Before upgrading from Angular 15 to Angular 18 with the new application builder, we used `paths` configurations in `tsconfig.json`, combined with `baseUr`l and a Webpack plugin, to directly reference the public API from our projects folder (where the libraries are located). This setup allowed Angular to trigger a rebuild whenever we made changes in a library.\r\n\r\nBefore migrating our main app to Angular 18, I tested this setup with a new Angular 18 project containing a single library. I found that the paths configuration should be supported out of the box with Angular 18 without needing additional changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the migration, I haven’t been able to get Angular (or esbuild) to recognize the `paths` defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. It seems that Angular is reading the compiled versions of the libraries inside `dist`, ignoring the paths configuration in `tsconfig.json`. I've tried various configurations, including changing `moduleResolution` to `bundler`, but none of these have resolved the issue. While VS Code's IntelliSense correctly recognizes the `paths` defined in `tsconfig.json` and does not show errors, running ng serve results in a series of errors:  \r\n<br>\r\n<b>  TS2307: Cannot find module '...' or its corresponding type declarations.</b>\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI'm not able to reproduce the issue because of the dimension of the project.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nTS2307: Cannot find module '....' or its corresponding type declarations.

`ssr` triggering the SSR during `serve` is causing us issues\r\n\r\nWhat we need to have is to be able to disable the ssr handling via vite (ng serve), but build the server only\r\n\r\n- no output: SSR output e.g. `dist/server`\r\n- no SSR server: no SSR from dev-server (through vite)\r\n\r\nUsing the following: **output + SSR server**\r\n```json\r\n\"prerender\": true,\r\n\"ssr\":

server**\r\n```json\r\n\"prerender\": false,\r\n\"ssr\": false\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust some more context - our SSR is handled via dotnet ATM and changing all the process its not very simple (and needs to work for local/prod).

(A hard reload with Ctrl-F5 does not help). Also, going into a private window seems to help.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I've never been able to reproduce this issue myself (the site is [BoardGamegGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)) but the reports are quite consistent, if not super frequent. It may be the case that some users run into this problem more than other users, but I can't say that for sure. The fact that cache clearing solves the issue seems to suggest that something about how Firefox is caching is causing it to cache some corrupt file, with cascading consequences, but that is purely conjecture on my part. \r\n\r\nThis may be related to angular/angular#44780, which we also reported, although note that that dates back to when Angular was using Webpack. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nIt is possible that you might run into this browsing the Angular portions of https://boardgamegeek.com\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.4\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Intermittent module load errors in Firefox only\" (#28361)"},{"Id":"2511146966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T20:48:21","Actor":"tsteuwer-accesso","Number":"28365","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, we're running to a lot of \"Chunk loading errors\" when using CI/CD with Angular and Angular's SSR. The reason for this is because our CDN reaches out to origin to get static assets, which are served from SSR. As soon as a new build goes out, the CDN is cleared, and the new assets are now live.\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with people currently on the site as lazy-loaded chunks that are still wanting to be requested in the users browser will try to go back to origin, only for the CDN to find out they no longer exists because chunk file hashes changed, and trigger the \"Chunk loading errors\" we're constantly seeing.\r\n\r\nIn order for users to fix this, they must do a hard-refresh, something we do not want our users to have to go through, especially since we're an international company and at any point in time, we can have people millions of people on in any of our regions.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to configure where **browser** static assets are pulled. One solution we thought of is to be able to change the URL where browser assets are pulled from. Think of it like this:\r\n\r\n1.) Build 5000 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5000/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n2.) Build 5001 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5001/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n\r\nIf user was currently on 5000, the static assets from the `/5000` folder can still be loaded from our domain. If the user refreshes, and we had cleared our CDN, they would start getting `/5001` requests because the main html changed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, we're thinking about just doing a find and replace on any `./chunk` string in the output dist for `/browser` and doing this ourselves. I'm not sure if the Google team has ran into this, I'm sure they have, but I would also welcome any other solutions you guys come up with. The easiest though, would be to allow us to configure this somehow so that server assets always load locally, but browser assets can be changed where you serve them from.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28365","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from\" (#28365)"},{"Id":"2510586019","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T15:12:15","Actor":"awdorrin","Number":"28360","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue moving to browser-esbuild from browser (Angular 17)","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe have an application built with ASP.Net Core and Angular using the legacy SpaServices / ClientApp template.\r\nOver time we have upgraded to .net 8 and Angular 17.\r\nI wanted to try to new build system, so I followed the instructions to replace \r\n`\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",`\r\nwith\r\n`\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",`\r\n\r\nUpon launching from Visual Studio, using the IISExpress option, I see the following, and the angular app never loads in the browser.\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Hosting.Lifetime: Information: Application started.

Delete out the 'n' & the 'e' to be left with a filter of 'O'; note that the 'myControl.value' is still `One` (due to having set `requireSelection`)\r\n4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c45088e-c38b-401a-ad4e-8d731fa00b20)\r\n5. Delete out the final 'O' from your filter; note that 'myControl.value' is again still `One`\r\n6. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\r\n7. In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2510479984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-09T06:43:00","Actor":"typescripterpro","Number":"29702","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding markers to a map in Angular 2 using ngOnInit after initialization","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEmbarking on my Angular journey by creating a sample app incorporating GoogleMaps.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit, Inject } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\nimport { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport Appcomponent = require(\"../app.component\");\r\nimport Accident = Appcomponent.Accident;\r\ndeclare var google: any;\r\ndeclare let map: any\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-map',\r\n  templateUrl: 'map.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./map.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class MapComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  private http: HttpClient;\r\n  private baseUrl: string;\r\n\r\n  private tags: string[];\r\n  private accidents: Accident[];\r\n  private accidentsMarkers: any[] = [];\r\n  private markers: any[] = [];\r\n\r\n  constructor(http: HttpClient, @Inject('BASE_URL') baseUrl: string) {\r\n    this.http = http;\r\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    var mapProp = {\r\n      center: new google.maps.LatLng(51.508742, -0.120850),\r\n      zoom: 5,\r\n      mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(\"googleMap\"), mapProp);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  public loadAccidents(): void {\r\n    this.http.get<Accident[]>(this.baseUrl + 'api/accidents').subscribe(result => {\r\n      this.accidents = result;\r\n\r\n      this.accidents.forEach(function (accident) {\r\n        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({\r\n          position: new google.maps.LatLng(accident.location.coordinates.lat,\r\n            accident.location.coordinates.lon),\r\n          map: this.map,\r\n          title: \"\"\r\n        });\r\n        this.markers.push(marker);\r\n      });\r\n    }, error => console.error(error));    \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Same \r\n\r\nhttps://qanswer.space/questions/adding-markers-to-a-map-in-angular-2-using-ngoninit-after-initialization\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhile I initialized map in ngOnInit, attempting to access it in loadAccidents results in an error message:\r\n\r\n`ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'markers' of undefined`\r\n\r\nThe order of execution suggests that the constructor is called prior to ngOnInit.

While this behavior might be a limitation inherent to Firefox, I believe it is worth documenting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the official CDK context menu example includes mocked \"copy\" and \"cut\" options, which exacerbates this issue.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior something that can be addressed, or is it an inherent limitation of how Firefox handles text selection and focus?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: cf. https://material.angular.io/cdk/menu/examples\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://material.angular.io/cdk/menu/examples with Firefox\r\n2. In \"Context menu\" example, try to select a portion of text and right click on it\r\n3.

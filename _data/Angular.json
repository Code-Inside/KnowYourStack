That actually makes it impossible to use `useClass` or `useFactory` together with `OnDestroy` when there is a dependency which isn't a class.\r\nAn example:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Test implements OnDestroy {\r\n  constructor(private readonly num: number) {\r\n    console.log(this.num);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n    console.log('Test Removed!');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function createTest(num: number): [InjectionToken<Test>, Provider] {\r\n  const token = new InjectionToken<Test>('Test');\r\n  const numToken = new InjectionToken<number>('num');\r\n\r\n  const numProvider: Provider = {\r\n    provide: numToken,\r\n    useValue: num,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const provider: Provider = {\r\n    provide: token,\r\n    useClass: Test,\r\n    deps: [numToken],\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return [token, [numProvider, provider]];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis code will run and work. You can also see there was once a PR that allowed destroy on factory created classes: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/23755.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is there is an error loop. `OnDestroy` won't compile here unless I add `@Injectable` but then I can't use `useClass` with the number dep as it is not known at compile time (Due to `strictInjectionParameters`).\r\nI don't think turning off `strictInjectionParameters` is a good option as it has benefits in other cases. The better idea is allowing `OnDestroy` on all classes regardless of them being decorated or not especially as the runtime allows it.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nClass is using Angular features but is not decorated.

At the time I started, what I was thinking of was specific to a set of tables I intended to use in an administrative context, so I navigated to something like /src/modules/sales/costing-tool/components/templates and typed \"ng g c admin-table\". \r\n\r\nBefore I hit enter, I thought about it and decided that rather than creating a module and specific use component that I'd rather make a general use component for generating p-tables dynamically & that it belonged in a shared module rather than a feature module. I thought I'd already deleted the CLI command out of the terminal so without looking I typed cd.. and hit enter. Which was the beginning of a 2+ hour headache that ended up costing me 2 days of work and which potentially could've cost me all the work I've done since May 5. \r\n\r\nSo the command I effectively entered was \"ng g c admin-tablecd..\", and what happened is that the CLI was able to somehow dodge the OS level naming safety conventions & it created a folder named admin-tablecd.., which caused there to be an unresolvable reference in my project structure and made it unloadable and unbuildable. And there was nothing I could do to delete the offending folder. I tried deleting it through the UI, using DOS commands, using WSL commands including rmdir with the -rf flag, nothing would get rid of it, even after a reboot. I had just about resolved myself to having to clone my latest remote to a new local repo which would've set me back to the 5th when I tried rmdir with the \"\\\\?\\c:\\path\\to\\bad\\directory\" syntax which finally worked.\r\n\r\nI think that optimally the generate command should respect naming safety conventions, or minimally provide a complimentary command to remove generated components. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nVia the CLI, generate a component with a name that ends in a directory traversal operator, i.e. new-componentcd..\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nThe system cannot find the file or directory specified\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1502.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core         15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   15.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular          15.2.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nCan't think of anything.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25282","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate command should respect file name safety conventions.\" (#25282)"},{"Id":"1727996788","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-26T15:27:15","Actor":"galczo5","Number":"25281","RawContent":null,"Title":"App is not starting after upgrade to angular 16.0.2","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi, after upgrade from 15.1.0 to 16.0.2 my app is not staring anymore.

The examples I found tried to combine `mat-nav-list` with `mat-accordion`, but only achieved this by doing quite a few hacks.\r\n\r\nIn the end I found out that `mat-tree` can easily be combined with `mat-nav-list` to achieve this use case. This works very straightforward and does not require any hacks.\r\n\r\nI created a [Stackblitz example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vpnnoq?file=src%2Fexample%2Fsidenav-menu.component.html) that shows the approach.\r\nI think it would be very valuable to add an example like this to the documentation.

Nothing at all.\r\n\r\n### Exhibit B: Tabs\r\n\r\nPer the [docs](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/api), with **bodyClass**, you can specify \"Classes to be passed to the tab mat-tab-body container. Supports string and string array values, same as ngClass.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you try to pass in a class, as we did with errorPopup above, it will **do nothing**. Same for the *labelClass* specified in the docs: **it's also a red herring that will do nothing**.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can effectively _hack_ material components. You can inspect elements in the browser, find relevant classes, and directly manipulate them. Here's, for instance, how I changed the \"active tab\" css for Material Tabs in my Sign In component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> styles.scss\r\n\r\napp-sign-in .mat-mdc-tab-header{\r\n  // hide the \"active\" underline\r\n  --mdc-tab-indicator-active-indicator-height:0px;\r\n}\r\napp-sign-in .mdc-tab--active{\r\n // make the active tab white\r\n  background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that _maybe_ you can get class-injection to work as specified in the docs, if you're willing to turn off View Encapsulation.\r\n\r\nThis is a sorry way to do things. Surely we can come up with a better way to let users customize Material Components.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nAttempt to add a class to a Material Component, as above.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe classes in my .scss files to be applied to Material Components, when I inject them as specified in the docs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNot a darn thing.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@angular/fire                   7.5.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27171","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding classes to material components is fundamentally broken\" (#27171)"},{"Id":"1726511806","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T21:27:08","Actor":"lesteral","Number":"27170","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DatePicker): Date Range validation error","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDate range picker gives wrong feedback \"Invalid end date\"\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. start at [Date range picker forms integration | Datepicker examples | Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms)\r\n2. for Start Date, type \"1/1/2022\", then Tab\r\n3. for End Date, type \"12/31/22\", then Tab\r\n4. so far, so good - see feedback: Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2022-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n5. click in End Date, change to \"12/31/21\" (i.e., end of the previous year)\r\n6. as expected: \"Invalid end date\" - feedback: Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2021-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n7. click in Start Date, change to \"1/1/21\", then Tab into \"End Date\" (no change - still 12/31/21)\r\n8. feedback now (as expected): Selected range: { \"start\": \"2021-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2021-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n9. however, **still shows \"Invalid end date\"** - even though the date range should now be valid\r\n10. further, Tab out of End Date, **still** shows \"Invalid end date\" - THIS IS THE ISSUE\r\n11. click in End Date, backspace and re-enter \"12/31/21\" - only now does the error message go away\r\n12. with some similar machinations, one can get \"Invalid start date\", with feedback: \"Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2022-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" } - i.e., wrong feedback even with good data\r\n![Date range picker forms integration - Invalid end date](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/73240819/3a3d3eaf-e431-49df-a3db-d2ab1873f830)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nno error message\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n\"Invalid end date\"\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome 113.0.5672.134 (Official Build) (64-bit) \r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Chromebook\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DatePicker): Date Range validation error\" (#27170)"},{"Id":"1726443736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T20:25:10","Actor":"duane-j-wagner","Number":"27169","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Drag and Drop): autoscroll fails in full size web view","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a hybrid mobile app (Ionic Capacitor) is made with a long list of draggable items, the autoscroll fails to engage.

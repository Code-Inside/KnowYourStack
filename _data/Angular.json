From my observations my blind guess would be, that Angular tries to simply translate these into old-style JS Unicode escapes. These old style escapes support 4 hexadecimal chars only (`\"\\u0000\"` to `\"\\uFFFF\"`). So these longer Strings get simply chopped of after the 4 right-most hexadecimal chars.\r\n\r\nI guess Angular would compile HTML `&#x1FFFF;` into JS `\"\\uFFFF\"` (missing `1`).\r\n\r\n## Why do I think so?\r\n\r\nIt just looks like it in the compiled templates of my example. See the comments in the compiled templates below.\r\n\r\nProduction build:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst compiled = {\r\n    // ...\r\n    template: function (n, r) {\r\n        if (1 & n && (gt(0,

At least, this seems to be the case when the token is typed to a type that does not have a runtime representation, such as an interface - but note that precisely this case is what the example, and the text blocks around it, are all about.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nI am in a situation where I need to provide a generically typed interface implementation on one side, and inject this very interface, generically typed, on the other side (e.g. of a component outlet).\r\n\r\nTo get the injection token with the correct type, I had a factory object generate the `InjectionToken` instance with the correct type parameter from a function in both the provider and the injection call.\r\n\r\nI was looking for confirmation that this can work, and the example showing that I can pass a newly instantiated `InjectionToken` to `injector.get` seemed to confirm this.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nI ran a little experiment, by declaring a provider, passing it to a component outlet, and trying to inject that provided value.\r\n\r\nWhen I called the `InjectionToken` constructor (e.g. like this: `new InjectionToken<ITestInfo>('test-info')`, with `ITestInfo` being a commonly accessible interface) both in the provider and the inject call (with the same type argument and desc value), I would get a `NullInjectorException`.\r\n\r\nWhen I used one and the same `InjectionToken` in both places, on the other hand, this worked without errors.\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n- A clear statement that, when typing the injection token to an interface type (or presumably, at least any type without a runtime representation), using the same _instance_ of `InjectionToken` in both provider and injection call is crucial.\r\n- A change of the misleading example to make clear that the same _instance_ of `InjectionToken` has to be passed to `injector.get` as what was used to provide the value.\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n```true\r\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(ModulesExampleTopicOneModule)[InjectionToken test-info -> InjectionToken test-info -> InjectionToken test-info]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken test-info!\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51270","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Example code for injection token is misleading/does not work this way\" (#51270)"},{"Id":"1836108652","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T08:02:57","Actor":"alkavats1","Number":"51268","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: removed the redundant initializer in router file","State":"closed","Body":"q param equals to null is behaving like redundant initializer\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the \\[ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the *config* of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) â€“ it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.\n-   Changed: \\[unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add `\"unicode-bom\": \"off\"` to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with `--fix` to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM).

[`v0.18.18`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01818)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.17...v0.18.18)\n\n-   Fix asset references with the `--line-limit` flag ([#&#8203;3286](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3286))\n\n    The recently-released `--line-limit` flag tells esbuild to terminate long lines after they pass this length limit. This includes automatically wrapping long strings across multiple lines using escaped newline syntax. However, using this could cause esbuild to generate incorrect code for references from generated output files to assets in the bundle (i.e. files loaded with the `file` or `copy` loaders). This is because esbuild implements asset references internally using find-and-replace with a randomly-generated string, but the find operation fails if the string is split by an escaped newline due to line wrapping. This release fixes the problem by not wrapping these strings. This issue affected asset references in both JS and CSS files.\n\n-   Support local names in CSS for `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release extends support for local names in CSS files loaded with the `local-css` loader to cover the `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` rules (and also `animation`, `list-style`, and `container` declarations). Here's an example:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes pulse {\n      from, to { opacity: 1 }\n      50% { opacity: 0.5 }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: ðŸŒ• ðŸŒ– ðŸŒ— ðŸŒ˜ ðŸŒ‘ ðŸŒ’ ðŸŒ“ ðŸŒ”;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container squish {\n      li { float: left }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n      list-style: inside moon;\n      container: squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With the `local-css` loader enabled, that CSS will be turned into something like this (with the local name mapping exposed to JS):\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes stdin_pulse {\n      from, to {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      50% {\n        opacity: 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style stdin_moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: ðŸŒ• ðŸŒ– ðŸŒ— ðŸŒ˜ ðŸŒ‘ ðŸŒ’ ðŸŒ“ ðŸŒ”;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container stdin_squish {\n      li {\n        float: left;\n      }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite stdin_pulse;\n      list-style: inside stdin_moon;\n      container: stdin_squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use a global name within a file loaded with the `local-css` loader, you can use a `:global` selector to do that:\n\n    ```css\n    div {\n      /* All symbols are global inside this scope (i.e.\n       * \"pulse\", \"moon\", and \"squish\" are global below) */\n      :global {\n        animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n        list-style: inside moon;\n        container: squish / size;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use `@keyframes`, `@counter-style`, or `@container` with a global name, make sure it's in a file that uses the `css` or `global-css` loader instead of the `local-css` loader. For example, you can configure `--loader:.module.css=local-css` so that the `local-css` loader only applies to `*.module.css` files.\n\n-   Support strings as keyframe animation names in CSS ([#&#8203;2555](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse animation names that are specified as strings and will convert them to identifiers. The CSS specification allows animation names to be specified using either identifiers or strings but Chrome only understands identifiers, so esbuild will now always convert string names to identifier names for Chrome compatibility:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" {\n      from { opacity: 1 }\n      to { opacity: 0 }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" { from { opacity: 1 } to { opacity: 0 } }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes hide\\ menu {\n      from {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      to {\n        opacity: 0;\n      }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out hide\\ menu;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>less/less.js (less)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.2.0`](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.64`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve (resolve)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.22.4`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n### [`v1.22.3`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When I type in a date that is after the max date, and then open the calendar, a marker appears on both the date I typed in and the max date. This behaviour could arguably be slightly confusing to the user but it is particularly misleading in the instance that the highlighted max date is actually disabled due to custom validation. The same issue can be seen for the minimum date.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/71448881/a2f4c43d-61f4-4ee1-be13-9cd381d7e33f)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=package.json (an example from the docs)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In datepicker-min-max-example.ts, adjust the max date so that it is not the last day of the month (so that the issue can be seen) e.g. change it to the 15th\r\n2. In the input, type in a date which is after the max date - e.g. the 18th\r\n3. Open the calendar and you will see that two dates are highlighted - the date that was typed in and the maximum date.\r\n4. Provide a custom validator that would render the maximum date disabled e.g. if the max date was a Sunday but weekends are not allowed. Repeat steps 2 & 3 and you will see that this date is highlighted even though it is invalid.\r\n5. Same steps for minimum date.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI am expecting to see only one date highlighted on the calendar - just the (invalid one) that was typed in. If this is not desired, then it should still take into account other invalid/disabled dates through customer validator, so it should highlight the maximum valid date rather than the general maximum date regardless of its validity. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI saw two dates highlighted on the calendar - the date I typed in and the maximum date. The maximum date is also highlighted even when it has been rendered invalid by a custom validator, which could be misleading to users - this is the main issue.

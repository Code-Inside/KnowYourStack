I'm Matteo Rossi, and i'm an italian full-stack developer, but i really like front-end and Angular.

Sometimes, the html and the css files, are really dirty, because of too many media queries or styles for make the page responsive.\r\nSo i was thinking a solution to this problem using Angular.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> I was thinking about have more templates for differents screen sizes. For beginning, i think we should have an option to define if a certain component is \"responsive\".\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51359557/58862610-57b00e80-86b1-11e9-823b-eb8604874b9a.png)\r\n\r\nIf the boolean flag is set to false, then the component will have the actual and standard setup.\r\nIf the boolean flag i set to true, then i imagine a scenario like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51359557/58864523-32bd9a80-86b5-11e9-8b8c-10fca6f3b240.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51359557/58864671-787a6300-86b5-11e9-948b-33ad87a092a5.png)\r\nPaths are wrong but there are only for give an idea of the setup.\r\nThe component still has his css file, that i mean like the parent css of the component, and switching the screen size, the others css would be applied.\r\nAfter this settings, Angular should know which template load dynamically, depending on the screen size. Obviously you can define the same template for differents screen sizes.\r\nOf course, i imagine an option too, in the Angular CLI to generate a responsive component:\r\ne.g. ng g c ComponentName --responsive\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about my idea? I know this could be a bit of duplication codes sometimes, but can be really usefull in some scenario, where html and css are really dirty.\r\nSorry for my bad english, i'm trying to improve it too.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30837","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Responsive Component Feature - Matteo Rossi\" (#30837)"},{"Id":"452226370","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-04T21:57:54","Actor":"MrCircuit","Number":"30860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Service worker cache progress or finished event","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> This feature request is for @angular/service-worker\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ✍️--> The angular service worker already provides an easy to use and robust caching solution for the assets of a web application. Nevertheless, there is currently no way to tell the user, at which percentage of the total amount of data the caching currently is working at and when it finished downloading the installation or update. Especially for use cases where the user just want to stay online for the time of installation or update, this issue is creating huge documentation and deployment problems for an offline web app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Although there is a similar, but much more general feature request (#22543), it would be great to just have a set of events, that report progress and / or start and finish of the caching process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> The current workaround is, that the users have to wait an indetermined amount of time until the web app is downloaded completely. The usage of the \"network\" tabs of the developer tools of browsers, where the progress can be monitored, is not wanted.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30860","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Service worker cache progress or finished event\" (#30860)"},{"Id":"452224873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-04T21:53:25","Actor":"dudewad","Number":"30859","RawContent":null,"Title":"ReactiveForms checkbox 'disabled' and 'checked' are not predictable when using FormBuilder.group()","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNot sure, haven't tried to do this before\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using FormBuilder to create a FormGroup, I have noticed that inputs of type `checkbox` cannot be set to both `disabled` and `checked`. `disabled` will work on its own, but when `checked` is added as well, I see the box gets checked but not disabled.\r\n\r\nI understand that checkbox `checked` states are linked to their `value` property (somehow or other) but this is unintuitive and I can't find anything for the life of me about how it is supposed to work or be configured. I noticed that adding a falsey value for a checkbox control config also causes a disabled state.\r\n\r\nConversely, I also noted that when a checkbox is configured w/o a value and then set to `disabled`, it actually stays enabled _and checks the checkbox_. Not sure what's up but maybe these properties are in conflict somehow?\r\n\r\nIf there _is_ documentation around this, it's _really really_ hard to find. If this is a bug (which it looks to be, I've been messing with this for quite some time now), then hopefully this issue brings it to light.\r\n\r\nManual configuration after the form group creation works (i.e. manually calling `disable()`) but this is not desirable.\r\n\r\n**A CLARIFICATION**\r\nThis is not a blocking bug. Checkbox inputs can still be configured using `value` and `disabled`. However I find this counter-intuitive. Configuring native inputs with `type=\"checkbox\"` involves giving them a value _and_ the input itself having a checked/unchecked _state_, which are two different things. I think Angular conflates the two, for what I can imagine was considered \"ease of use\", but given that this is not how you configure native checkbox elements, it is frustrating, confusing, and worse, takes a long time to debug.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-3sy5kw\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.9\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.9\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.9\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.19\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nFYI the version in stackblitz also reproduces the issue.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30859","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ReactiveForms checkbox 'disabled' and 'checked' are not predictable when using FormBuilder.group()\" (#30859)"},{"Id":"452219019","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-04T21:35:40","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"30858","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove unreferenced tsconfig-build.json files","State":"open","Body":"These are no longer needed since Bazel generates a tsconfig for each compilation","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30858","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove unreferenced tsconfig-build.json files\" (#30858)"},{"Id":"452215925","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-04T21:27:03","Actor":"dscheerens","Number":"30857","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): do not notify URL change listeners more than once per `PopStateEvent`","State":"open","Body":"Every time a URL change listener is registered via `Location.onUrlChange` a new subscription is\r\nmade to `Location` itself to notify listeners whenever a `PopStateEvent` occurs.

But I also want to benefit from differential loading.\r\n\r\n`ng build` supports differential loading both in dev and prod mode, apparently `ng serve` and `ng test` don't. (`ng e2e`does not either as being build on top of `ng serve`)\r\n\r\nI am fine for `ng serve` not doing it but I still **do** want to have `ng test/e2e` working with real differential loading. It is even **mandatory** for anyone that needs to test Internet Explorer support.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds proposed:\r\n\r\n+ Revert back to pre ng-cli-8 era (ie `target: es5` for everyone in `tsconfig.json` and no differential loading).\r\n+ Maintain 2 different build paths / configuration in my `package.json`/`angular.json`\r\n\r\nNone of these workarounds suit my need.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.1\r\nNode: 10.9.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.1\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nTrying to dig down all these things, I also ended up looking at the code of this [commit](https://github.com/filipesilva/angular-cli/commit/0efc72453189eba5313ba0deecec38e92aa337d7)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6ec09919b5c2695dee784ce0c3accee7f9754bb0/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/karma-debug.html#L32-L33\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of doing that?

You can support Autoprefixer and other open source projects important for your business by [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-autoprefixer).\n\n#### Browsers\n\nAutoprefixer adds prefixes only for target browsers, browsers which is support on your project.\n\nInitially, Autoprefixer had the `browsers` option to set target browsers. But we found that many tools need target browsers too. [`postcss-preset-env`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) and `babel-preset-env` use them to add only actual polyfills, [postcss-normalize](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-normalize) uses them to add only necessary CSS reset rules, plugins for ESLint and Stylelint will warn you if some of the target browsers doesn’t support your code.\n\nThis is why we created [Browserslist](https://togithub.com/browserslist/browserslist) config file. It is a single config for all tools.\n\nA lot of users still uses the `browsers` option. We understand them; it is hard to change old practice. Unfortunately, using the `browsers` option creates many problems. For instance, you can miss that your build tool has own Autoprefixer inside. It will cut your prefixes because it will not know about your target browsers.\n\nThis is why, in 9.6, we decided to deprecate the `browsers` option. Autoprefixer will show a warning on this option. In the next 10.0 release, we will drop this option. This is how you can migrate:\n\n1.  Create `browserslist` key with an array in `package.json`.\n2.  Copy queries from the `browsers` option. If you have `browsers: [“last 1 version”, “not dead”]`, then you need:\n\n    ```js\n       \"browserslist\": [\n         \"last 1 version\",\n         \"not dead\"\n       ]\n    ```\n\n#### HiDPI Media Query\n\nWe all need to support HiDPI/retina screen now. Autoprefixer supports specific media query for HiDPI screens:\n\n```css\n.image {\n  background-image: url(image@1x.png);\n}\n@&#8203;media (min-resolution: 2dppx) {\n  .image {\n    background-image: url(image@2x.png);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\n.image {\n  background-image: url(image@1x.png);\n}\n@&#8203;media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),\n       (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2/1),\n       (min-resolution: 2dppx) {\n  .image {\n    background-image: url(image@2x.png);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBug we found that [CSS Values 4 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#resolution) added `x` alias for `dppx`.\n\nAutoprefixer 9.6 supports `@media (min-resolution: 2x)` shortcut. Note, that Autoprefixer will not convert it to `2dppx`. Autoprefixer adds only prefixes. Use [`postcss-preset-env`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) to add polyfills.\n\n#### Other\n\n-   [`text-orientation`](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/text-orientation/) property support was added.\n-   [@&#8203;jmmarco](https://togithub.com/jmmarco) added `CONTRIBUTING.md`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

At the time, the issue was closed saying the behavior was intended.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16184","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-menu focuses the second item on Arrow Down when opened with the mouse\" (#16184)"},{"Id":"451201100","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-02T15:00:48","Actor":"jpike88","Number":"16183","RawContent":null,"Title":"matSubheader  has no effect in a mat-nav-list","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. have a mat-nav-list\r\n2. put a subheader item like this into it:\r\n\r\n```<h3 matSubheader>Subheading</h3>```\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSubheader row should not have ripple on click, and should have some sort of styling that indicates that it's not a link (like a grey background or something).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt has ripple, and looks like a button despite the matSubheader attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular 8, macOS, safari/chrome","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"matSubheader  has no effect in a mat-nav-list\" (#16183)"},{"Id":"451169241","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-02T09:12:25","Actor":"AnthonyNahas","Number":"16182","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: cannot use schematics to update my project to v8","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. angular material project with v7\r\n2. `ng update @angular/material`\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nto run the schematics and upgrade my project to v8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`Repository is not clean.

Further attempts to make emits will not work even with `ngzone.run()`.\r\n\r\nYou can see this bug on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/KostyaTretyak/angular-global-output-bug?file=src%2Fapp%2Fchild.component.ts) or on [my repository](https://github.com/KostyaTretyak/angular-global-output-bug). If you try to click the \"first\" link and then the \"second\" link, everything will work as expected. But if you try to do it again, when you click on \"second\" you will not see the output message from the child `mesage from child @Output`.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I created several child components, each of which works with its vendor to login through social networks (Facebook, Google, etc.). These vendors call callbacks from a global context. In this case, I can't rely on using `@Output` because they don't work properly.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.7\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.7\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46288","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@Output not working properly from global context even with ngzone.run()\" (#46288)"},{"Id":"1263324242","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-07T13:40:49","Actor":"mgechev","Number":"46289","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): update the extension version","State":"open","Body":"Update the version for the Firefox and Chrome extension to enable us\r\nto publish the latest support of standalone components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46289","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): update the extension version\" (#46289)"},{"Id":"1261389737","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-07T13:12:46","Actor":"Zemnmez","Number":"46265","RawContent":null,"Title":"ts-api-guardian is broken and not marked as deprecated","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nts-api-guardian has been removed as of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/42735\r\n\r\nHowever, it's still on NPM without any deprecation warning.

Selecting SCSS seems to be required to reproduce the issue, but adding routing does not.\r\n- Run `ng test --watch=false` and observe the tests running, then the process terminating after completion.\r\n- Run `npm i @angular/cli@14 -g` to install Angular CLI 14.\r\n- Run `ng test --watch=false`. The message `Your global Angular CLI version (14.0.0) is greater than your local version (13.3.7). The local Angular CLI version is used.` will be displayed.

Moreover `ng serve` is working fine, but not the build.\r\n\r\nI created a repo for this issue, [main](https://github.com/mgameover/app-n-lib/tree/main) branch contains working version (ng v13) and [ng-14](https://github.com/mgameover/app-n-lib/tree/ng-14) branch has the same code after `ng update @angular/core@14 @angular/cli@14` with the issue.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce the issue.**\r\n1. Clone [main](https://github.com/mgameover/app-n-lib/tree/main) branch\r\n2. Make sure that it builds the lib by running `npm run build-components` (ng build components)\r\n3. Update angular to v14 by  running `ng update @angular/core@14 @angular/cli@14` \r\n4.

These were denied repeatedly.\r\nWith non-trivial projects, the given workarounds lead to unmaintainable configuration spaghetti, where it would be pretty simple to separate the individual configuration facets.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to allow developers using angular-cli to manage their projects efficiently and allow Angular maintainers to not have to deal with merging logic, *I suggest adding a mechanism which allows the project developers to conduct the merging process in whatever fashion they fancy*. \r\nTo achieve this, add an optional callback from [src](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/f6f37821c892fbe476e0879877415dbadef5e359/packages/angular_devkit/architect/node/node-modules-architect-host.ts#L182) that allows the project developers to apply whatever magic they deem necessary. This will allow the community to create plugins which will achieve the most common tasks.\r\n\r\nThings needed:\r\n- add configuration property to angular.json schema to reference the external merging function\r\n- add callback invocation (if enabled) to the code where configuration options are decided on (see above)\r\n- callback method should look like\r\n  ```ts\r\n  function angularConfigurationOptionCallback(activeConfigurationNames: string[], optionsLookup: Record<string, AngularCLIOptions>): AngularCLIOptions;\r\n  ```\r\n  where `activeConfigurationNames` is an array of currently enabled configrations, eg `--configuration=a,b,c -> ['a','b','c']`\r\n  where `optionsLookup` is a lookup of all configuration options of angular.json mapped by their name\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- Hacking package.json install callbacks to monkey patch the angular-cli files in question (would need to track all minor updates for breaking changes).\r\n- Using a surrounding build tool (maven, gradle, ..) to do the monkey patching\r\n- Throw away the sophisticated configuration and use another build tool to prepare the workspace by assembling all conditional assets and file replacements beforehand\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23300","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow custom option merging wrt multiple configurations\" (#23300)"},{"Id":"1260017418","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-07T07:32:53","Actor":"akaufmann","Number":"23284","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updating Angular to v13 installs a few Angular v14 packages","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter I wanted to upgrade a NG v12 project to v13, some NG v14 packages were installed. \r\nI run the update process via\r\n`ng update @angular/cdk@13 @angular/cli@13 @angular/core@13 @ngrx/store ng-mocks --force` as `ng update` suggested it.\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2022-06-03 um 15 51 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/288499/171878296-2bee3be9-3b76-4f8d-a13e-a9f3bdddd701.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the update installed a mixture of v13 and v14 packages.\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2022-06-03 um 15 26 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/288499/171864942-0d05284e-ede9-4d60-bf29-f889ce0ff539.png)\r\n\r\nPS: I am not sure if the `--force` has anything to do with it, but I could not do the update without it.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng version\r\nYour global Angular CLI version (14.0.0-rc.0) is greater than your local version (13.3.7).

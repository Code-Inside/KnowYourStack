This behavior causes confusion for users seeking version-specific documentation.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://v18.angular.dev\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI would like the following improvements to address the problem:\n\n1. **Correct Redirection**: Selecting v18 from the version dropdown on https://v18.angular.dev/ should not redirect to https://angular.dev/. Instead, it should stay on https://v18.angular.dev/.\n2. **Stable Version Clarity**: The dropdown should include an option labeled stable, which links to the latest stable documentation version, currently https://angular.dev/.\n3.  **Comprehensive Version Listing**: The dropdown should explicitly list all versions, including those beyond v18 (e.g., v19, v20) as they are released, for easy navigation without ambiguity.\n\nThese changes will ensure a more intuitive and seamless user experience when navigating between Angular versions.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03c3929e-7ed4-4a5a-be33-d6ac988f343a)\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58918","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs:  Version dropdown on v18.angular.dev redirects to incorrect URL and lacks clarity in version listing\" (#58918)"},{"Id":"2696266613","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T22:27:58","Actor":"samuelfernandez","Number":"58917","RawContent":null,"Title":"Promise API for resource","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIdeally, resource would expose a promise as part of its public API that:\n\n* Would be pending while the resource is loading\n* Would resolve when the status is loaded\n* Would reject with the error\n\nIt would be a fit to use in async calls or route resolvers.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt could be a new method named `resolve()` or similar.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing effects to watch the state and generate a promise.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58917","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Promise API for resource\" (#58917)"},{"Id":"2696265086","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T22:27:01","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"58916","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add change detection tracing service","State":"open","Body":"This will warn users when they are rendering too much based on the config they provide.

This proposal aims to:\n\n1. **Enhance Signal Composition**\n- Break down complex computed signals into smaller, reusable operations\n- Enable clear separation of concerns in data transformation logic\n- Improve code readability through familiar operator patterns\n2. **Strengthen Signal Reactivity**\n- Add powerful reactive capabilities to the Signal system\n- Bridge the gap between synchronous computations and async operations\n3. **Improve Developer Experience**\n- Provide a clean, fluent API for complex state transformations\n- Enable gradual adoption of more sophisticated Signal patterns\n- Support natural decomposition of business logic into focused, testable units\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n## RxJS Integration\n\nAdd a new operator that allows seamless integration between Angular Signals and RxJS, enabling direct piping of Signal values through RxJS operators and back to Signals without explicit conversion steps.\n\n### Current Behaviour\n\nCurrently, developers need to use both toObservable() and toSignal() to work with RxJS operators in a Signal context:\n\n```typescript\nquery: WritableSignal<string> = signal('');\n\ntodos: Signal<Todo[]> = toSignal(\n  toObservable(this.query).pipe(\n    // RxJS operators\n  ),\n  { initialValue: [] }\n);\n```\n\n### Desired Behavior\n \nIntroduce a new pipe() operator that handles the Signal-RxJS-Signal conversion internally:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { rxPipe } from \"@angular/core/rxjs-interop\";\n\n...\n\nquery: WritableSignal<string> = signal('');\n\ntodos: Signal<Todo[]> = rxPipe(\n  this.query, \n  map((query) => query.trim()),\n  filter((query) => query.length > 0),\n  distinctUntilChanged(),\n  debounceTime(500),\n  switchMap((query) => ...),\n);\n```\n\n### Technical Details\n\n#### Proposed API\n\n```typescript\nimport { OperatorFunction } from 'rxjs';\n\n...\n\nfunction rxPipe<T>(\n  source: Signal<T>,\n  ...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[]\n): Signal<R>; // where R is the result of piping\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n## Native Signal Operators\n\nExtend Signal interface with native implementations of common reactive operators, allowing direct operator chaining without RxJS dependency:\n\n```typescript\ninterface Signal<T> {\n    ...\n    pipe<R>(\n      ...operators: SignalOperatorFunction<T, R>[]\n    ): Signal<R>;\n  }\n\n...\n\nquery: WritableSignal<string> = signal('');\ntodos: Signal<Todo[]> = query.pipe(\n  map((query) => query.trim()),\n  filter((query) => query.length > 0),\n  distinctUntilChanged(),\n  debounceTime(500),\n  switchMap((query) => ...),\n);\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58912","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(signals): Enhance Signal composition with reactive operators\" (#58912)"},{"Id":"2695658635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T18:20:15","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"58911","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): improve API reference page loading time and drop blocking time","State":"open","Body":"By scheduling the focus of the input, we can drop the blocking time that is caused by the blocking task of rendering.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently we use focus immediately using afterRenderEffect, but we don't have any signals inside the body of the fn, so we can convert that to be afterNextRender, and also in order for it to not be part of the current task, we can schedule it for later using requestIdleCallback. \r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-11-26 at 19 19 22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa0ca49b-94be-4392-9fc1-01677e855b78)\r\nThe blocking task is ~854ms which is too much!

when the same service is present in the same directory as the `app.component.ts`, the app builds and runs without any problem.\n\nThis makes me think the problem is the resolution of DI between libraries and applications.\n\nThe MRE doesn't mirror our use-case completely, as the error appears in `INITIALIZE_APP` while using said service, with the same error, but we have many of these services and most are used in components, so I figured this would bring to the same solution.\nYou can observe those extra errors by adding the service to `INITIALIZE_APP` or by turning on SSG.\n\n**Notice**: the error is reported twice upon page navigation (one on the server and one on the client?) if used in the `app.component.ts`, while it's thrown during build if used in `app.config` with `APP_INITIALIZER`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/Mochitto/angular-ssr-NG0203\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR RuntimeError: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `ru\nnInInjectionContext`.

But since all my thousands tests passed before, now I get dozens of random errors across my apps but the common point seems to be the use of `jasmine.clock()` at some key points. I get multiple times this cryptic error : \n\n`Error: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions. Is the clock already installed?`\n\nSince I never got this error before setting `builderMode` to `application` I don't see what I'm doing wrong.\n\nSo I started a fresh project (just a plain `ng new` hello world app) and just tried to install a clock on the existing unit test. Nothing more. An boom, I got the error I mentionned earlier.\nSorry I can't provide you much more informations as I just don't understand what's going on but I hope someone will find a way to solve this problem which seems to be the source of all my trouble in unit tests with esbuild.\n\nThank you for your efforts :)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions.

It doesn't appear to be triggering `initDepsOptimizer()` - any idea how I can force that to be triggered? Or is there a way to provide a vite config to skip optimizing our internal libs?\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Failed to resolve entry for package \"@acme/components\".

With CommonEngine it was possible to set the baseHref in angular.json to '/' to achieve this.\n\n```json\n      \"i18n\": {\n        \"sourceLocale\": {\n          \"code\": \"en\",\n          \"baseHref\": \"/\"\n        },\n        \"locales\": {\n          \"de\": \"src/messages/messages.de.xlf\",\n          \"es\": \"src/messages/messages.es.xlf\"\n        }\n      }\n```\n\nNow I have migrated this application to Angular 19 and noticed that this does not seem to be possible anymore with AngularNodeAppEngine as the default locale 'en' is not recognized. The build is successful and all other locales work fine, except 'en'. Even the root path works, because the potentialLocale is '' (empty string) in this case, but no child routes can be found (at least not with ssr). Is this behavior expected? If so, are there still any workarounds to disable the locale prefix for a specific locale?\n\nIn a (maybe) naive approach, I tried adding the following line just before returning the entryPointExport in [app-engine.ts#L146](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blame/7b0aa3dec56298bb364516ac189aa32accc7dcc2/packages/angular/ssr/src/app-engine.ts#L146) and it worked, so it seems to be supported everywhere except in this particular location and therefore I really hope it's just a bug and I don't have to revert the migration.\n```javascript\nif (!entryPoints.has(potentialLocale) && entryPoints.has(\"\")) {\n    return this.getEntryPointExports(\"\");\n}\n```\n\nAny help is appreciated, because everything else is already migrated.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRepo: https://github.com/eufri/angular-ssr-issue\n\nBasically I have created a new app\n`ng new angular-ssr-issue --ssr --minimal --package-manager=yarn --routing --server-routing --skip-tests --ssr`\n\nAdded localize package\n`ng add @angular/localize`\n\nAnd then added some test locales + messages and a child component +route\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.1\n@angular/cli                    19.0.1\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.1\n@schematics/angular             19.0.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28967","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Set locale baseHref to '/' is not working with AngularNodeAppEngine\" (#28967)"},{"Id":"2692373245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:54:18","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28966","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28966","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release\" (#28966)"},{"Id":"2692286139","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:49:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28964","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28964","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.\" (#28964)"},{"Id":"2687406837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T20:17:32","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"28948","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build fails in Angular SSR application with route parameters","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have added Angular SSR in an [existing Angular app with routing enabled](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Angular-Fifth-Edition/blob/main/ch15/src/app/app.routes.ts) and when I run `ng build` I get the following error:\n\n`The 'products/:id' route uses prerendering and includes parameters, but 'getPrerenderParams' is missing.

Inability to run different versions of Material UI simultaneously during migration\n2. Requirement to upgrade both Angular and Material UI versions together\n3. Major internal architecture changes in Material UI (particularly v14-15)\n4. No supported path for incremental component migration\n\n## Impact\n\n- Large applications with custom Material UI implementations are effectively locked into Angular 14 or below.\n- Organizations must choose between:\n\n  - Maintaining legacy versions indefinitely\n  - Complete system-wide upgrade with significant business impact\n\n\n- Increased technical debt as teams delay upgrades\n- Higher migration costs due to required \"big bang\" approach\n\n## Requested Solution\nPlease consider implementing:\n\n1. Support for running multiple Material versions simultaneously\n2. Backward compatibility layers for core APIs\n3. Tooling for incremental migration paths\n\n## Context\nOur organization maintains a large Angular application using Material UI v12 with extensive customizations. The current upgrade path requirements make it nearly impossible to maintain both system stability and technical currency. Due to this pain point the company has decided to move to another framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30071","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material Migration Pain Point: Version Lock-in Prevents Incremental Updates\" (#30071)"},{"Id":"2681230953","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T11:48:50","Actor":"Frankystan","Number":"30062","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CHIPS): Global configuration (provider) for MatChipsModule does not work","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you create a provider to configure adding chips behaviour globally such as when user press COMMA, SPACE or ENTER keycodes , chips are not shown/added to the input.\n// custom-chips.provider.ts\nimport { Provider } from '@angular/core';\nimport { MAT_CHIPS_DEFAULT_OPTIONS } from '@angular/material/chips';\nimport { ENTER, COMMA, SPACE } from '@angular/cdk/keycodes';\n\n\nexport const provideCustomChipsProvider: Provider[] = [\n    {\n        provide: MAT_CHIPS_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n        useValue: {\n            separatorKeyCodes: [COMMA, ENTER, SPACE],\n        },\n        multi: true,\n    },\n];\n\n// Usage in app.config.ts\n...\nimport { provideCustomChipsProvider } from '@providers/custom-chips.provider';\n\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n    providers: [\n        provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),\n        provideAnimationsAsync(),\n        provideHttpClient(),\n        provideRouter(APP_ROUTES, withComponentInputBinding()),\n        .....\n       provideCustomChipsProvider,\n    ],\n};\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

The `_openPanelInternal` function needs to be called to ensure the panel is open before processing the selected option logic.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30074","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): ensure selected option updates correctly on backspace\" (#30074)"},{"Id":"2686512799","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-23T19:45:11","Actor":"0xFACE","Number":"30072","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nI get following warning when building the application:\n`The same typography styles are generated multiple times.

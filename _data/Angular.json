Specifically, in this case it updates the first time `.update()` is invoked, but not any sequential time.\n\nI've verified that the signal dependency is indeed getting updated via Angular Dev Tools and `console.log()` invocations.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uiyfuqpe?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide

Second, to ensure that we perform the write after the DOM elements have been created (this doesn't happen until the end of change detection when animations are enabled).\r\n\r\nThis is needed to efficiently set the select value when adding/removing options. The previous approach resulted in exponentially more `_compareValue` calls than the number of option elements (issue angular#41330).\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR fixes an issue with delayed element removal when using the animations module (in all browsers). Previously when a selected option was removed (so no option matched the ngModel anymore), Angular changed the select element value before actually removing the option from the DOM. Then when the option was finally removed from the DOM, the browser would change the select value to that of the first option, even though it didn't match the ngModel (issue angular#18430). Note that this is still somewhat of an application problem when using `ngModel`. The model value still needs to be updated to a valid value when the selected value is deleted or it will be out of sync with the DOM.\r\n\r\nFixes #41330, fixes #18430.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TGP](https://fusion2.corp.google.com/presubmit/767187673/OCL:767187673:BASE:768170964:1749237427897:f6a68b3b/targets)\r\nrequires an update to the screenshots in one test, with minor shifting in the placement of the text in the select control (see cl/767187673)\r\n\r\nThough there is a green TGP, this changes the timing of values being written to the DOM, which still caries some risk. We should merge to `main` only to give more time for things to be discovered internally prior to external release.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61949","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): improve select performance\" (#61949)"},{"Id":"3125522263","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T19:42:46","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61945","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add error handling doc to the menu","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61945","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: Add error handling doc to the menu\" (#61945)"},{"Id":"3125223047","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T19:38:23","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"61938","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: use new pull-request-labeling action","State":"closed","Body":"This moves to the new labeling which includes the feature request made in https://github.com/angular/dev-infra/issues/2851","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: use new pull-request-labeling action\" (#61938)"},{"Id":"3125550878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T18:36:16","Actor":"kartikwatwani","Number":"61946","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested components not working in v20","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn angular v19, the nested component structure ComponentA->ComponentB->@defer(when someCondition){ComponentA}, worked but in Angular v20 for the same structure I am getting following error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ɵcmp' of undefined`\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ɵcmp' of undefined\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular V20\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61946","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested components not working in v20\" (#61946)"},{"Id":"3125306910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T16:47:17","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61944","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.0.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `03896ac` -> `aef918c` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f072244` -> `3a765b3` |\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `f072244` -> `3a765b3` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It addition, the idea of automatically creating the vitest configuration based on 'angular.json' might not provide all the flexibility, but it provides some significant other benefits:\n\n1. No duplication between 'vitest.config.ts' and 'angular.json'\n2. Future proofing in case of any additional test runner migrations\n\nUnfortunately, not all required configuration options were available through 'angular.json' at this point. As a result, here are the changes that I had to temporarily make in \"node_modules\\@angular\\build\\src\\builders\\unit-test\\builder.js\":\n\n1. Changed the mock configuration to automatically restore spies.\n`test.restoreMocks: true`\n This simulates the Jasmine default behavior and would simplify the migration process from Karma. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json' and default to true.\n2. Changed the default coverage reporter\n`test.coverage.reporter: 'html'`\nThis removes the default 'text' reporter, which sends the coverage report to the terminal while providing code coverage information within the Vitest UI. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'.\n3. Changed the browser configuration for some use cases\n`browser.headless: true`\nHowever, both configurations ('true' and 'false') are being used. Ideally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'.\n4. Changed the browser configuration\n`browser.instances.viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }`\nIdeally, this would be configurable through 'angular.json'.

That override breaks Angular Material’s default for `<mat-icon>`, which is `display: inline-block`. As a result, any `<mat-icon>` inside a `<mat-icon-button>` ends up off-center (because `inline-block` plus Tailwind’s inherited letter-spacing shifts it). This issue **only** occurs when Tailwind is loaded—if you run a bare Material setup without Tailwind, the icon stays perfectly centered.\n\nIn this GIF, you can see:  \n- **Default (with Tailwind + `display: inline-block`)** → icon is off-center  \n- **Modified (`display: block`)** → icon is correctly centered  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f85259-d479-4e2c-9753-3e3e98b80702)\n\n---\n\n**Workaround**  \nYou can fix it globally by adding this to your CSS:\n\n```css\n.mdc-icon-button .mat-icon {\n  display: block;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Change**  \nSince an icon inside a `mat-icon-button` doesn’t actually need `inline-block`, it would be helpful if the default were changed to `display: block`. That way, icons remain centered even when Tailwind (or any similar CSS reset) is used.\n\n---\n\n**Side Note**  \nThe official docs still show `matIconButton` in code examples, but in your HTML it must be written as `mat-icon-button`. I copy-pasted it and was confused for a moment 😅.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-aksf9tvg?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIcons inside `mat-icon-button` should be perfectly centered by default, even when Tailwind is loaded.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen Tailwind is used, its Preflight reset applies `letter-spacing: inherit` to buttons. This overrides Angular Material’s default `display: inline-block` for `<mat-icon>`, causing the icon to appear off-center inside `mat-icon-button`.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\nAngular CLI: 19.1.9\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.5.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router, service-worker\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.9\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.5\n@angular/cdk                    19.1.2\n@angular/cli                    19.1.9\n@angular/fire                   19.2.0\n@angular/material               19.1.2\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.5\n@schematics/angular             19.1.5\nng-packagr                      19.1.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-icon-button & mat-icon): mat-icon misaligned in mat-icon-button when using Tailwind\" (#31304)"},{"Id":"3124615960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T12:17:47","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31303","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): use system colors","State":"open","Body":"Realigns the slide toggle back to the Material 2 switch spec with a surface-colored handle","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31303","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): use system colors\" (#31303)"},{"Id":"3124504105","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T11:28:44","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31302","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/select): use system color for arrow","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31302","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/select): use system color for arrow\" (#31302)"},{"Id":"3123510811","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T03:27:01","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31300","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): use system colors","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31300","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): use system colors\" (#31300)"},{"Id":"3118277998","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:40:25","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31290","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): create grid navigation behavior","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31290","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): create grid navigation behavior\" (#31290)"},{"Id":"3121638603","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T15:23:40","Actor":"devversion","Number":"31299","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: fix schematics not respecting new `-module.ts` suffix","State":"closed","Body":"Angular CLI generates `-module.ts` suffix when using `--standalone: false`.

Using matButton (as shown in some places) didn’t work.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31297","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue with Button Directive Naming: matButton vs mat-button\" (#31297)"},{"Id":"3121147624","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T12:59:59","Actor":"sh977218","Number":"31298","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-input): mat input type of search shows 2 clear buttons","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nit looks the mat-input with type of 'search' shows both HTML's input's search button and the mat-button for clear.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/geoplzxh?file=src%2Fexample%2Finput-clearable-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCan we hide the HTML input's clear button or cover it up with the mat-button clear button.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-input with type of 'search' shows two clear buttons\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.0.2 or any previous\n- CDK/Material: 20.0.2 or any previous\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Mac/Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31298","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-input): mat input type of search shows 2 clear buttons\" (#31298)"},{"Id":"3120771758","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T11:02:51","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"31296","RawContent":null,"Title":"Luminosity ratio of focus indicator for ‘Slide me!’ control is less than the minimum required ratio of 3:1","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nLuminosity ratio of focus indicator for ‘Slide me!’ control is less than the minimum required ratio of 3:1.

The placeholder gets moved around between drop containers as the user is dragging. In some cases this might not be desirable, because the data representing the dragged item might be copied, rather than moved.\r\n\r\nThese changes address this use case by adding the `cdkDropListHasAnchor` input. When enabled, it'll tell the drop list to leave an anchor element, representing the dragged item, inside the original list.

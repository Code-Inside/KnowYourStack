And we want to specify its provider.\r\n\r\nYou can do that in the compile time using `viewProviders` option in `@Component` decorator. But, currently, there is no way to do it programmatically.\r\n\r\ni.e. when that component is created dynamically by `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` method, you can only specify providers using `injector` option in `Injector.create()` method. But those providers will not be applied to that directive.\r\n\r\nHere is [live example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-eygesl?file=src/app/app.component.ts). Take a closer look at providers and console output.\r\n\r\nWhen `providers` array is used, factory is not called because search stops on `<input>` component (ngModel uses `@Host` and `@Optional` decorators): \r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-provider-form',\r\n  template: '<input name=\"username\" [(ngModel)]=\"username\" />',\r\n  providers: [{provide: ControlContainer, useFactory: () => {console.log('provider factory')}}],\r\n})\r\nexport class ProviderestFormComponent  {\r\n  username: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when `viewProviders` array is used factory is called:\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-view-provider-form',\r\n  template: '<input name=\"username\" [(ngModel)]=\"username\" />',\r\n  viewProviders: [{provide: ControlContainer, useFactory: () => {console.log('view provider factory')}}],\r\n})\r\nexport class ViewProviderFormComponent  {\r\n  username: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it would be really convenient to be able to specify this when form is created dynamically. Otherwise there is no easy way to bind parent ngForm directive and child ngModels.\r\n\r\nRelated issues: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47580 , https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34780\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd `viewInjector` option to ViewContainerRef.createComponent() options.

Therefore, there would be no content for portal outlets in removal animations: [StackBlitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ts-strict-enabled-atg95k?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)\r\n\r\n![Portal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63489409/203807440-3c6d48af-420c-4453-9e1c-013db996e2b2.gif)\r\n\r\nThe problem above can actually be easily solved by using `ngTemplateOutlet` instead of `cdkPortalOutlet`, but in many cases the problem can be really hard to work around.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on implementing [the app \"Reply\" of Material Studies](https://m2.material.io/design/material-studies/reply.html) in [this repository](https://github.com/TheNightmareX/reply). I am using the directive `libLayoutProjectionNode` and the component injection tree to build a tree of nodes, so that I can implement the Container Transform animation by using the Layout Projection technique. The Layout Projection technique basically creates a snapshot of the layout before changing the dom, and transform the elements from their old layouts to their new layouts after the dom has changed.\r\n\r\nThis is the best Container Transform that we can implement using Angular:\r\n\r\n![Reply Container Transform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63489409/203804010-78000514-9507-4c59-8638-cb2102540fa0.gif)\r\n\r\nAnd this is the standard Container Transform from Material Design:\r\n\r\n![Container Transform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63489409/203805888-9bd63e5f-e9de-4672-be09-e25e4c47e86b.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, our Container Transform works mostly well except that there is no crossfade transition.\r\n\r\nHere comes the problem - It's completely impossible to implement a crossfade transition because it's impossible to get the old tree of nodes as them have already been detached from their parents in the `ngOnDestroy` hook to avoid memory leak. 🤷 \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI propose that we should have a new life-cycle hook, which is invoked after the element of a component is actually removed from the DOM. A proposed name can be `ngOnElementDestroy`.\r\n\r\nDevelopers should consider using this new `ngOnElementDestroy` hook to clean up their components/directives if the code they put in the `ngOnDestroy` hook changes the DOM.\r\n\r\nThis should significantly make the DOM more stable for removal animations.\r\n\r\nI know that it's probably not the best choice to introduce a new life-cycle hook, but I failed to find out a better solution. 🤷 \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nOtherwise WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF COMPLICATED WORKAROUNDS TO IMPLEMENT THESE FANTASTIC REMOVAL ANIMATIONS!!!!!!!!!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48224","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature] Add Component Life-cycle Hook `ngOnElementDestroy` for Better Animations\" (#48224)"},{"Id":"1463365337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-24T13:39:03","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"48223","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update eslint dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular-eslint/builder](https://togithub.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) | devDependencies | major | [`^14.0.0` -> `^15.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-eslint%2fbuilder/14.4.0/15.1.0) |\n| [@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://togithub.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) | devDependencies | major | [`^14.0.0` -> `^15.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-eslint%2feslint-plugin/14.4.0/15.1.0) |\n| [@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin-template](https://togithub.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) | devDependencies | major | [`^14.0.0` -> `^15.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-eslint%2feslint-plugin-template/14.4.0/15.1.0) |\n| [@angular-eslint/template-parser](https://togithub.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) | devDependencies | major | [`^14.0.0` -> `^15.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-eslint%2ftemplate-parser/14.4.0/15.1.0) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.33.0` -> `5.44.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2feslint-plugin/5.33.0/5.44.0) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.33.0` -> `5.44.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/5.33.0/5.44.0) |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

Custom decorators can return a new class that extends the original once, which means that the `…µ…µgetInheritedFactory` call will now resolve to the factory of the `Child`, causing an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThese changes fix the issue by changing the inherited factory resolution logic so that it walks up the prototype chain class-by-class, while skipping classes that have the same factory as the class that was passed in.\r\n\r\nFixes #35733.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): infinite loop if injectable using inheritance has a custom decorator\" (#37561)"},{"Id":"637829252","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T22:09:03","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"37556","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(dev-infra): add `#` to outputed list of PRs for discover-new-conflicts","State":"closed","Body":"Adding in a `#` prepended to each PR number in the list of conflicting PRs\r\nfound by the discover-new-conflicts script will allow for users to copy\r\npaste the output from the script into a github comment and have the PRs\r\nautomatically link.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37556","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(dev-infra): add `#` to outputed list of PRs for discover-new-conflicts\" (#37556)"},{"Id":"637955274","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T22:08:13","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"37560","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: upload build results to ResultStore for CI linux bazel executions","State":"closed","Body":"Bazel invocations will upload to ResultStore to allow for us to have better viewing\r\nof execution/build logs.

After reading the API docs and [issue #17902](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17902) I found out that [`SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader`](https://angular.io/api/router/testing/SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader) is what I need to test my lazy-loaded modules. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the discussion of that issue @burtonjc proposed a [different approach](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17902#issuecomment-385509867) to the one used in the API docs. He says:\r\n\r\n> The linked docs use router.resetConfig which blows away the actual routes you are trying to test. This means you could delete your routes in source code and the tests will still pass (not ideal). We were looking to test our actual lazy route while still stubbing the lazy loading of the module.\r\n\r\nAnd the implementation is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({ template: '' })\r\n  class LazyLoadedComponent { }\r\n\r\n  @NgModule({ declarations: [ LazyLoadedComponent ]})\r\n  class LazyModule { }\r\n\r\n  it('lazily navigates to \"/project/create\"', fakeAsync(() => {\r\n    const loader = TestBed.get(NgModuleFactoryLoader);\r\n    loader.stubbedModules = {\r\n      './create-project/create-project.module#CreateProjectModule': LazyModule,\r\n    };\r\n    spy(loader, 'load');\r\n\r\n    router.navigate(['project', 'create']);\r\n\r\n    tick();\r\n    expect(location.path()).to.equal('/project/create');\r\n    expect(loader.load).to.have.been.calledOnce;\r\n    expect(loader.load).to.have.been.calledWith('./create-project/create-project.module#CreateProjectModule');\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to use the suggested approach, in order to test the actual routes of my routing module instead of resetting them through `router.resetConfig()`. However, **when you specify [`LoadChildren`](https://angular.io/api/router/LoadChildren) in the routing module, the new standard way is to employ a [callback to load the module](https://angular.io/api/router/LoadChildrenCallback), and the [string path](https://angular.io/api/router/DeprecatedLoadChildren) that one can also use in [`loader.stubbedModules`](https://angular.io/api/router/testing/SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader#properties) is now deprecated. This means that there is no way to load stubbed modules using the actual routes of my routing module.**\r\n\r\n### Solution I'd like\r\nI would like to know if there is a way to update the implementation of `SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader` to allow for the requirements above. One should be able to pass the routing module's actual routes to `RouterTestingModule` and use `loader.stubbedModules` to specify stubbed lazy loaded modules without resetting the actual routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n- Reset routes through `router.resetConfig()`, as the docs suggest. The problem with this is that I don't know what I'm testing, since the tests end up covering only my test doubles and lose all connection to the actual code of my routing module.\r\n\r\n- Test routing only through integration tests. I know this is an option, but I think there is room for some coverage through unit tests, especially if something like `SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader` already exists.

This was not an issue with v9.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginally reported in rules_nodejs: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932. I'll summarize the the main points here.\r\n\r\n@alan-agius4 did some preliminary analysis:\r\n\r\n\"This is the result that In version 10, incremental type-checking was introduced in Ivy, instead of a global type-checking file we now have a type-checking file for each file.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems here that I can see here.\r\n\r\nIn tsc_wrapped, the return of setupCompilation is ignored. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/blob/c4b325859b8d2c0579b094c67f449f1c3143271e/internal/tsc_wrapped/tsc_wrapped.ts#L389 This returns 2 pieces of information, files are shouldn't be emitted and files which shouldn't be checked for diagnostics. This will cause 2 extra files to be emitted for each original source file. myfile.ngtypecheck.d.ts and myfile.ngtypecheck.js.\r\n\r\nIn the TS source file, a triple-slash reference to the type-checking file is added, however this is not removed when emitting the DTS, this seems to be more of a bug in the plugin itself.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if maybe the first issue should be handled directly by NG Compiler, maybe sometime similar to ngtsc.wrapHost, because I am seeing that anyone who uses the plugin API will need to filter out those files from being emitted.\r\n\r\nI did create a reproduction without Bazel https://github.com/alan-agius4/ngtsc-plugin-demo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed the fix itself needs to happen at a NG plugin level, Unless you want to add temporary patch in rules_typescript.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not clear to me who will address point 1 in rules_typescript.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had a chat with Alex R, he mentioned that the plugin is still experimental/in development and is not production ready and not surprised at all that there are such issues since the plugin API itself is not complete (it‚Äôs about half way there) nor rigorously tested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSo far this is reproduced in a rules_nodejs PR: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932\r\n\r\nIts a bit tricky to run in there so

I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Specifically, color support checking is now done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1cd51e64c7331a9cc48d59e8fd6df74d3c6c48f3/packages/angular/cli/utilities/color.ts#L11-L14\r\n\r\nAlas, when node is run within a MINGW terminal (as installed by git for windows), `process.stdout` is a `Socket`, causing `instanceof WriteStream` to return false, and all use of colors by the angular CLI to be disabled, even though the MINGW terminal supports colors just fine ...\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Typings do not contain the function call (added in Node.js v9.9.0)\r\nexport const supportsColor =\r\n  process.stdout instanceof WriteStream\r\n  && ((process.stdout as unknown) as { getColorDepth(): number }).getColorDepth() > 1 \r\n  || process.env.MSYSTEM; // MINGW terminals support color even though nodejs mistakes them for a Socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can submit a PR to that effect.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might prefer to delegate to angular_devkit/core/src/terminal/caps.ts instead, whose vendored implementation of `supportsColor` still contains my earlier fix. However, not knowing your policy for dependencies across npm packages I don't feel comfortable submitting a PR to that effect.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17924","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"webpack output is no longer colored in git bash (again)\"

Description\r\nHey\r\n\r\nCurrently I have been using Nginx with my Angular build and its directly pointed towards Angular output path i.e. /dist folder and serving it from there itself.\r\n\r\nBut what happens is when I run `ng build --prod` on the server then it remove the old build first from the output folder and then compile the new build from the source code and till the time the process completed my Nginx throws `internal server error`.\r\n\r\nI know the option `--deleteOutputPath=false` where you can specify ng build to not delete the output path files but it just keeps on adding files which I think is not a good option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere should be an option in ng build like `--preserveOutputPath=true` where if given will not delete any content from the output path until the compilation is done and then replaces the new build files with the old build files.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAs I am using Ansible to deploy and build angular app on server I have to specify different output path while building app and then replaces that one's files with the output path (/dist) files which is an additional task needed to perform.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option in ng build to preserve build files until compilation is

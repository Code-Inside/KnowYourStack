I see currently no way how to force a signal to emit on mutable changes.\r\n\r\nI would kindly ask you to reconsider removing the short-circuit introduced in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52465.\r\n\r\nIf not, I could provide a PR that explains that behavior in the documentation.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nRun customized equality check even if object reference is the same.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUpdate the documentation with a proper explanation: https://angular.dev/guide/signals#signal-equality-functions","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53139","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signal Equality and mutable changes\" (#53139)"},{"Id":"2008867022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T23:39:57","Actor":"DevJaGz","Number":"53142","RawContent":null,"Title":"CSS property can not be appended/set using Renderer2 ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhy the Renderer2 does not work to set a CSS property?. I use the following line of code to try to modify the value of the CSS property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nthis._renderer.setStyle(this.caret, '--_duration', `${this.duration}ms`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I manipulate the DOM directly it works, look:\r\n```typescript\r\n  this.caret.style.setProperty('--_duration', `${this.duration}ms`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, based on the Angular documentation, it is not a good practice to manipulate the DOM directly.\r\n\r\nBelow, I provide you a replicate of the bug using a simple example of rotating a Caret Icon. The logic is shown in a component to make it easier, however, all the logic must be in a Directive, with the creation logic of the Caret as a child HTML element where the directive is applied.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-wleffp?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNA\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"stackblitz-starters-wleffp\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^17.0.4\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"^7.8.1\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.6.2\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.14.2\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\r\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.1100.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.6.0\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~3.6.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^1.5.0\",\r\n    \"protractor\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~8.3.0\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~6.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.0.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53142","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CSS property can not be appended/set using Renderer2 \" (#53142)"},{"Id":"2008861179","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T23:22:52","Actor":"RobinMeow","Number":"53141","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResolveFn Examples not displaying as intended","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nPretty sure these examples are supposed to be code snippets. \r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/api/router/ResolveFn?tab=description\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\ncode snippets\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/111490292/d31c6387-d655-44bc-b835-7e6c06dd6474)\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n```true\r\nI was using Google Chrome to view the website\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53141","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ResolveFn Examples not displaying as intended\" (#53141)"},{"Id":"2008871212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T22:51:51","Actor":"ducin","Number":"53143","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(devtools): basic support for signals (#50944), split into Readab…","State":"open","Body":"…le and Writable Signals.

It worked exactly as described in the server-side docs:\r\n\r\n\r\n> If you are using Angular on the server in combination with the Angular service worker, the behavior deviates from the normal server-side rendering behavior. The initial server request will be rendered on the server as expected. However, after that initial request, subsequent requests are handled by the service worker and always client-side rendered.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade to Angular 17, this has stopped working. My requests are always bypassing the service-worker cache and retrieve the resources from the server.\r\n\r\nI am using a basic setup.\r\n\r\nHere is the content of `ngsw-config.json`:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"./node_modules/@angular/service-worker/config/schema.json\",\r\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\r\n  \"assetGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"app\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/favicon.ico\",\r\n          \"/index.html\",\r\n          \"/manifest.webmanifest\",\r\n          \"/*.css\",\r\n          \"/*.js\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"assets\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"lazy\",\r\n      \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/assets/**\",\r\n          \"/*.(svg|cur|jpg|jpeg|png|apng|webp|avif|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"dataGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"translations\",\r\n      \"urls\": [\r\n        \"api/translation/i18n/**\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"cacheConfig\": {\r\n        \"strategy\": \"performance\",\r\n        \"maxAge\": \"15m\",\r\n        \"maxSize\": 50\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have debugged `ngsw-worker.js` and found out that inside the `assignVersion(event)` we have this part of the code that returns null after the update to Angular 17.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.state !== DriverReadyState.NORMAL) {\r\n   return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the fact that the state value in my case is  `DriverReadyState.EXISTING_CLIENTS_ONLY`.\r\n\r\nSo the next question was why?

However, unlike other members of the CompilerHost, `jsDocParsingMode` is not a method and cannot be delegated in this way. Attempting to call bind on the property will result in a runtime error. Instead, `jsDocParsingMode` is now delegated via get/set accessors.

This is in continuation of the issue: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48242\r\n\r\n* If a Standalone component imports a module that has a service added in its providers array, then instead of using the existing singleton instance it creates a new instance of the service. This is contrary to the behavior of a normal module where even if we import a module that has a service added in its providers array, the existing singleton instance is injected into it.\r\n* If a component has two or more standalone components, one of which imports a module with the service in the providers array and the other does not, then, automatically the one without the import also uses the new service instance instead of using the global singleton instance. \r\n\r\nAny help to understand how services behave differently in Standalone components when compared to a normal module would

The synchronous version is now used which has a JavaScript implementation that does not suffer from these problems.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26453","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): avoid native realpath in application builder\" (#26453)"},{"Id":"2007497304","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T13:24:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26464","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): adjust wording of dev server client status messages","State":"closed","Body":"To minimize ambiguity, the update related log messages for the development server now consistently indicate that the page reload, HMR update, or otherwise has actually been sent to any connected clients.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26464","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): adjust wording of dev server client status messages\" (#26464)"},{"Id":"2008011812","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T13:22:52","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26471","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.22.8","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.22.7` -> `v2.22.8` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.22.8`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.22.7...v2.22.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.22.7...v2.22.8)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

that have a dash in their name.\r\n\r\nConsider the following JSON:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\",\r\n  \"with-dash\": \"With dash, OK\",\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nloaded in a component dynamically:\r\n```ts\r\n  jsonContent: any;\r\n\r\n  async show() {\r\n    const fileName = 'test';\r\n    this.jsonContent = await import(`./${fileName}.json`);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then displayed:\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"show()\">Load and show JSON content</button>\r\n\r\n@if (jsonContent) {\r\n<h1>Whole object</h1>\r\n<pre>{{ jsonContent | json }}</pre>\r\n\r\n<h1>Default property</h1>\r\n<pre>{{ jsonContent.default | json

OK\",\r\n    \"nested\": {\r\n      \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n      \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas the default content is correct:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\",\r\n  \"with-dash\": \"With dash, OK\",\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n

the new version of Angular and its migration to @angular/ssr, using 'ng serve' is not based on an Express server. How can I locally work on a project, including hydration, when some components are displayed only for mobile devices and others only for desktop? Previously, I could do this by passing the user-agent to the ngx-device-detector library and obtaining information about the user's device. Unfortunately, currently on localhost I do not have the ability to check what device it is because the REQUEST and RESPONSE have a value of null. As a result, it is difficult to work on the project. How can I deal with this?\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"app\">\r\n  @if (!isMobile) {\r\n  <app-header></app-header>\r\n  }\r\n  @if (isMobile) {\r\n  <app-bottom-navbar></app-bottom-navbar>\r\n  }\r\n</div>\r\n`\r\n\r\nCurrently, on the server side, the isMobile variable will always assume a hardcoded value, e.g. true, until it receives the correct value on the browser side.

Previously we couldn't do it because we didn't want to introduce a dependency to `@angular/cdk`.\r\n\r\n### feat(youtube-player): automatically load youtube api\r\nCurrently users have to load the YouTube API themselves which can be tricky to get right and be prone to race conditions. Since there's only one way to load it, these changes switch to doing so automatically. Loading the API automatically also enables us to optimize the component further in a follow-up PR by showing a placeholder image.\r\n\r\nIf users don't want the API to be loaded automatically, they can disable it through an input or using the newly-introduced `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_CONFIG` injection token.\r\n\r\nFixes #17037.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** there was an earlier attempt at this feature in #21401 which didn't land due to some concerns around API loading.

The problem is more general though.\n\nThe logs are far too unprecise to help finding the piece of code at fault. The traceback is not deep enough to recover the call sequence too. Plus, async calls and the observers nature make even more hazardous the use of `console.log` to investigate.\n\nIn my case, I simply got such tracebacks at first :\n```bash\n00:48:54 [vite] Internal server error: undefined\n      at AbortSignal.abortHandler (C:\\Users\\Someone\\WebstormProjects\\my-project\\.angular\\cache\\19.2.10\\my-project\\vite\\deps_ssr\\chunk-ZONHDKL3.js:10329:14)\n      at [nodejs.internal.kHybridDispatch] (node:internal/event_target:827:20)\n      at AbortSignal.dispatchEvent (node:internal/event_target:762:26)\n      at runAbort (node:internal/abort_controller:447:10)\n      at abortSignal (node:internal/abort_controller:433:3)\n      at AbortController.abort (node:internal/abort_controller:466:5)\n      at AbortSignal.abort (node:internal/deps/undici/undici:9536:14)\n      at [nodejs.internal.kHybridDispatch] (node:internal/event_target:827:20)\n      at AbortSignal.dispatchEvent (node:internal/event_target:762:26)\n      at runAbort (node:internal/abort_controller:447:10) (x18)\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"str\" argument must be of type string.

Like in the following:\n```typescript\n  getData(): Observable<any[]> {\n    return this.httpClient.get<any[]>(this.apiUrl).pipe(\n      catchError(() => of(defaultData)),\n      shareReplay(1)\n    );\n  }\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIf you have any way of making the logs or the traceback more explicit when vite fails with `Internal server error: undefined`, it would be of great help !\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf there is some tooling helping the debug of Vite, you may add some documentation or a blog post.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61198","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve logs and trace for [vite] Internal server error: undefined\" (#61198)"},{"Id":"3046990142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T19:40:55","Actor":"devversion","Number":"61197","RawContent":null,"Title":"[20.0.x]: Remove legacy circular deps tests and migrate symbol extractor to ts_project","State":"open","Body":"Patch port of #61156","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61197","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[20.0.x]: Remove legacy circular deps tests and migrate symbol extractor to ts_project\" (#61197)"},{"Id":"3046933284","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T19:13:00","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"61196","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] docs: rename `@nodoc` to `@docs-private`","State":"open","Body":"patch version of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61194","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61196","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[PATCH] docs: rename `@nodoc` to `@docs-private`\" (#61196)"},{"Id":"3046900005","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T18:56:10","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"61195","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix typo in update-cdk-apis job","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61195","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: fix typo in update-cdk-apis job\" (#61195)"},{"Id":"3046535161","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T18:25:01","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61188","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CDK apis [main]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular CDK api files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61188","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update Angular CDK apis [main]\" (#61188)"},{"Id":"3046530388","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T18:23:41","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61186","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CDK apis [19.2.x]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular CDK api files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61186","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update Angular CDK apis [19.2.x]\" (#61186)"},{"Id":"3046462861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-07T18:21:49","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"61184","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: document `preventDefault()` behavior for event listeners","State":"closed","Body":"The `false` behavior has existed for a long time but hasn't really been documented.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.3...v0.25.4)\n\n-   Add simple support for CORS to esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;4125](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4125))\n\n    Starting with version 0.25.0, esbuild's development server is no longer configured to serve cross-origin requests. This was a deliberate change to prevent any website you visit from accessing your running esbuild development server. However, this change prevented (by design) certain use cases such as \"debugging in production\" by having your production website load code from `localhost` where the esbuild development server is running.\n\n    To enable this use case, esbuild is adding a feature to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (a.k.a. CORS) for [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests). Specifically, passing your origin to the new `cors` option will now set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header when the request has a matching `Origin` header. Note that this currently only works for requests that don't send a preflight `OPTIONS` request, as esbuild's development server doesn't currently support `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n    Some examples:\n\n    -   **CLI:**\n\n            esbuild --servedir=. --cors-origin=https://example.com\n\n    -   **JS:**\n\n        ```js\n        const ctx = await esbuild.context({})\n        await ctx.serve({\n          servedir: '.',\n          cors: {\n            origin: 'https://example.com',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   **Go:**\n\n        ```go\n        ctx, _ := api.Context(api.BuildOptions{})\n        ctx.Serve(api.ServeOptions{\n          Servedir: \".\",\n          CORS: api.CORSOptions{\n            Origin: []string{\"https://example.com\"},\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    The special origin `*` can be used to allow any origin to access esbuild's development server. Note that this means any website you visit will be able to read everything served by esbuild.\n\n-   Pass through invalid URLs in source maps unmodified ([#&#8203;4169](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4169))\n\n    This fixes a regression in version 0.25.0 where `sources` in source maps that form invalid URLs were not being passed through to the output. Version 0.25.0 changed the interpretation of `sources` from file paths to URLs, which means that URL parsing can now fail. Previously URLs that couldn't be parsed were replaced with the empty string. With this release, invalid URLs in `sources` should now be passed through unmodified.\n\n-   Handle exports named `__proto__` in ES modules ([#&#8203;4162](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4162), [#&#8203;4163](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4163))\n\n    In JavaScript, the special property name `__proto__` sets the prototype when used inside an object literal. Previously esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS conversion didn't special-case the property name of exports named `__proto__` so the exported getter accidentally became the prototype of the object literal. It's unclear what this affects, if anything, but it's better practice to avoid this by using a computed property name in this case.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n###

This is the code I was working on: \n```html\n<p>reactive-form works!</p>\n\n\n<form [formGroup]=\"form\" (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\"></form>\n<label for=\"username\">Username\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" formControlName=\"username\">\n</label>\n```\n```ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  FormControl,\n  FormGroup,\n  ReactiveFormsModule,\n  Validators,\n} from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-reactive-form',\n  imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],\n  templateUrl: './reactive-form.component.html',\n  styleUrl: './reactive-form.component.css',\n})\nexport class ReactiveFormComponent {\n  form = new FormGroup({\n    username: new FormControl('', Validators.required),\n    email: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email]),\n    password: new FormControl('', [\n      Validators.required,\n      Validators.minLength(10),\n    ]),\n  });\n\n  onSubmit() {\n    if (this.form.valid) console.log('Form Submitted', this.form.value);\n    else console.log('Invalid Form');\n  }\n}\n```\nI just added the text \"Username\" to the label in html code above and that's when I got this bug in the terminal.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new component using `ng generate component reactive-form`\n2. Copy the above code into the html and ts files\n3. Edit the form input label from 'username' to anything else.\n4.

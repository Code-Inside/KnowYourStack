If you add anything remotely big like a CSS theme, you're easily over that limit. Note that if you add a pre-built Material theme, it adds an extra 7kB.\n\nI'm not sure about the internals of the library, but it seems rather odd. I feel like the injection tokens shouldn't cause the rest of the features to be loaded.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ldgbpznx-ia2hbzsb?file=src%2Ftest.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLoad the actual components lazily.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe components are in the initial bundle.\n\n### Environment\n```\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / â–³ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.2\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.3\n... cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms, material\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.2\n@angular/build               20.0.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Configuring default options for different mat components results in the entire component being in the initial bundle\" (#31342)"},{"Id":"3139199565","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-12T07:38:25","Actor":"dinesh250-star","Number":"31341","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(BUTTON): mat-button changed to matButton in angular material 20","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn angular 20, mat-button has been changed to matButton.

In this scenario, resizing the dialog causes it to move outside the viewport, which is not the expected behavior.\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen the dialog is dragged to the top-left corner, resizing should not cause it to move outside the visible area of the screen.

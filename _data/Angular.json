This commit adds a serialization logic that adds element locations (instructions on how to navigate to a particular element from another known location of other element) into the hydration state for the following cases:\r\n\r\n- when a TNode is a first element in projection segment (other nodes are linked from that node)\r\n- when a TNode's next sibling is different before and after projection (we serialize extra info about the template-based sibling)\r\n- when a TNode's previous sibling was a content projection (i.e. `<ng-content>` slot), because we can not rely on the previous element in this case (projection happens at a later point)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49454","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): adding hydration for content projection\" (#49454)"},{"Id":"1628221427","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-16T20:27:32","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"49453","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): add support for compile-time required inputs","State":"open","Body":"**Note:** this is a resubmit of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49304 which had to be rolled back temporarily due to an internal issue.\r\n\r\nAdds support for marking a directive input as required. During template type checking, the compiler will verify that all required inputs have been specified and will raise a diagnostic if one or more are missing. Some specifics:\r\n* Inputs are marked as required by passing an object literal with a `required: true` property to the `Input` decorator or into the `inputs` array.\r\n* Required inputs imply that the directive can't work without them. This is why there's a new check that enforces that all required inputs of a host directive are exposed on the host.\r\n* Required input diagnostics are reported through the `OutOfBandDiagnosticRecorder`, rather than generating a new structure in the TCB, because it allows us to provide a better error message.\r\n* Currently required inputs are only supported during AOT compilation, because knowing which bindings are present during JIT can be tricky and may lead to increased bundle sizes.\r\n\r\nFixes

This violates the strict styles [Content Security Policy](https://web.dev/strict-csp/) which doesn't allow inline styles by default. One way to allow the styles to be applied is to set a `nonce` attribute on them, but because the code for inserting the stylesheets is deep inside the framework, users weren't able to provide it without accessing private APIs.\r\n\r\nThese changes add a new `CSP_NONCE` injection token that will allow users to provide a nonce, if their app is using CSP. If the token isn't provided, the framework will look for an `ngCspNonce` attribute on the app's root node instead. The latter approach is provided as a convenience for apps that render the `index.html` through a server, e.g. `<app ngCspNonce=\"{% randomNonceAddedByTheServer %}\"></app>`.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses adding the nonce to framework-generated styles.

`FormRecord`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, the `FormRecord` only support typing the control, but not the key:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew FormRecord<FormControl<boolean>>({\r\n  key1: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  key2: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  key3: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the controls can only be `FormControl<boolean>` but the keys of the controls can be anything (as long as it is a string).\r\n\r\nBut in some cases we want to key to be restricted to a specific set of strings (or Enum).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nenum ControlKey {\r\n  Key1 = 'key1',\r\n  Key2 = 'key2',\r\n  Key3 = 'key3',\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew FormRecord<FormControl<boolean>>({\r\n  key1: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  key2: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  key4: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }), // I want the \"key4\" to throw a typing error here\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for known list of options that we can active/deactivate through a form.\r\n\r\nThe topic has already been discussed here:\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45607#issuecomment-1098292360\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/44513#discussioncomment-1991963\r\n\r\nBut it looks like it has never been considered as a new feature.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe could update the typing of `FormRecord` with something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class FormRecord<\r\n  TControl extends AbstractControl = AbstractControl,\r\n  TKey extends string = string\r\n> extends FormGroup<Partial<Record<TKey, TControl>>> {}\r\n\r\nexport interface FormRecord<TControl, TKey> {\r\n  registerControl(name: TKey, control: TControl): TControl;\r\n  addControl(name: TKey, control: TControl, options?: { emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  removeControl(name: TKey, options?: { emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  setControl(name: TKey, control: TControl, options?: { emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  contains(controlName: TKey): boolean;\r\n  setValue(value: Partial<Record<TKey, ɵValue<TControl>>>, options?: { onlySelf?: boolean, emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  patchValue(value: Partial<Record<TKey, ɵValue<TControl>>>, options?: { onlySelf?: boolean, emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  reset(value?: Partial<Record<TKey, ɵValue<TControl>>>, options?: { onlySelf?: boolean, emitEvent?: boolean }): void;\r\n  getRawValue(): Partial<Record<TKey, ɵValue<TControl>>>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that we can use it like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nenum ControlKey {\r\n  Key1 = 'key1',\r\n  Key2 = 'key2',\r\n  Key3 = 'key3',\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst form = new FormRecord<FormControl<boolean>, ControlKey>({\r\n  [ControlKey.Key1]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  [ControlKey.Key2]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  [ControlKey.Key3]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAt the moment I'm using a `FormGroup` to match my need:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nenum ControlKey {\r\n  Key1 = 'key1',\r\n  Key2 = 'key2',\r\n  Key3 = 'key3',\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew FormGroup<Partial<Record<ControlKey, FormControl<boolean>>>>({\r\n  [ControlKey.Key1]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  [ControlKey.Key2]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n  [ControlKey.Key3]: new FormControl(false, { nonNullable: true }),\r\n});\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49442","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add typed key for `FormRecord`\"

Angular is not doing so hot on the StackOverflow annual surveys, coming in as the \"most dreaded\" framework for 3 years in a row and counting. A glance at the npm stats is eye-opening.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55965128/225167579-63b22951-a718-41e1-b9ea-04a3fc476a78.png)\r\n\r\nI think this is actually a shame, as Google hires brilliant people and leads the world's internet in almost every other way. I think the Angular team could really benefit from considering changes that would earn some reputation among the developers who are clamoring for a better DX. With the introduction of signals, you've already started seeing some positive light shone on the framework among both the common community and the influential voices in it. Let's capitalize on that while we have the momentum!\r\n\r\nThe popular trend is moving toward simplified code with less boilerplate, and functional components have been a great way to achieve that. React is the obvious example here, despite some criticisms of its hooks. Vue3 came next with its setup scripts, dramatically reducing its boilerplate. And now we're in a new era of front end frameworks, where Solid is making its debut with functional components that only run once, while subsequent renders are centered around signals.\r\n\r\nAngular brings a unique perspective to development that may be overlooked and undervalued, specifically because people don't look long enough to see it. Some of its notable strengths are _prescribed architecture_, _resilience to bugs_, and its _powerful CLI_. Let's see if we can get away with sprinkling a little bit of DX without sacrificing any of that! I think functional components would be a very interesting place to start.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe following demonstrates one possible idea for how this could be implemented in Angular. Please keep in mind, this is very raw and unrefined - the primary purpose of the feature request is to get some feedback and discussion brewing in both the Angular team and the greater dev community.\r\n\r\nAnother note just for transparency, I'm out of practice when it comes to Angular, so a lot of my experience may be more reflective of what I'm used to seeing in React/Next and Vue/Nuxt. If this discussion gains traction, I will be more than happy to refresh myself on the more advanced usage and contribute any way I can.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { setupComponent, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HeroService } from '../../services/hero.service';\r\n\r\nexport const define = setupComponent({\r\n  selector: 'app-hero-list',\r\n  inject: { heroService: HeroService },\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst HeroListComponent = ({\r\n  ngInput,\r\n  ngOutput,\r\n  ngComponent,\r\n  heroService,\r\n}) => {\r\n\r\n  // I/O\r\n  const title = ngInput<string>('Hero List'); // defines an Input (prop)\r\n  const onSelect = ngOutput<Hero>(); // defines an EventEmitter\r\n\r\n  // component state\r\n  const heroes = signal<Hero[]>([]);\r\n  const selectedHero = signal<Hero | null>(null);\r\n  const selectHero = (hero: Hero) => {\r\n    selectedHero.set(hero);\r\n    onSelect.emit(hero);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // fetch data\r\n  heroService.fetchHeroes().subscribe((resultHeroes: Hero[]) => {\r\n    heroes.set(resultHeroes);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // provide values to the template and return it\r\n  //  *notes:\n  //    - this could be made simpler with JSX or even lit-html, if we forego the Angular templating.\n  //    - you could potentially use `templateUrl` here too.\r\n  return ngComponent({\r\n    provide: { title, heroes, selectHero, selectedHero },\r\n    template: `\r\n      <h2>{{ title }}</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p><em>Select a hero from the list to see details.</em></p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li *ngFor=\"let hero of heroes()\">\r\n          <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"selectHero(hero)\">\r\n            {{ hero.name }}\r\n          </button>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <app-hero-detail *ngIf=\"selectedHero()\" [hero]=\"selectedHero()\"></app-hero-detail>\r\n    `,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default HeroListComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part could happen under the hood, but it could be important for testing's sake:\r\n```ts\r\nimport HeroListComponent, { define } from 'heroList.component';\r\ndefine(HeroListComponent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the code more or less speaks for itself, but here are some things to note:\r\n\r\n- The `define` exported function would be replaceable with a mock version, which would inject mock dependencies like that HeroService.\r\n- This component function would be run once like Solid, not repeatedly like React.\r\n- Notice all dependencies are destructured from the params instead of being imported directly. This is intentional, because such a pattern tends to be slightly easier to test.\r\n- Opting out of decorators like this may be more attractive to conscientious devs who don't like the idea of supporting a [non-standard feature](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) using compiler magic to force it to work across platforms.\r\n- You may even consider supporting JSX here... but on the other side of things, I imagine `templateUrl: './heroList.component.html'` could be an option to maintain the separation as well. Worth noting, I don't think a lot of modern developers value markup separation at this point, because the [concerns are separated differently these days](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/modern-day-separation-of-concerns-74e79ff87767). It does seem to be something that many Angular advocates seem to like, though, so it's a matter of balancing your existing users against appealing to new users.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI don't know how applicable alternatives are in this circumstance, but I suppose the core issue is DX. I do have a laundry list of other items that could make DX a little friendlier.\r\n\r\n- Add support for [HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)\r\n- Add support for [fallthrough attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs.html)\r\n- Simplify state management - see [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)\r\n- First class support for [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)\r\n- Services could be more functional also\r\n\r\nWith enough discussion, it may warrant opening new issues for any/all of these bullet points...","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49431","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Functional Components\" (#49431)"},{"Id":"1624923734","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-15T15:38:14","Actor":"demike","Number":"49432","RawContent":null,"Title":"errorOnUnknownElements does not work in combination with ngIf","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTest Setup karma / jasmine with NX\r\n\r\nif a template looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n<my-unknown-component></my-unknown-component>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe test environment option `errorOnUnknownElements` behaves as expected and fails the test(s) where this component is created.\r\n\r\nBut if an ngIf is involved and the unknown element in the template is instantiated in some later point in time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n<my-unknown-component *ngIf=\"someCondition\"></my-unknown-component>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe error is just logged into console but the Tests do not fail!\r\n\r\nThis might also be an issue with `errorOnUnknownProperties`\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.5.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49432","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"errorOnUnknownElements does not work in combination with ngIf\" (#49432)"},{"Id":"1625623256","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-15T14:19:07","Actor":"avmaxim","Number":"49435","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): improve docs for styling precedence and class binding.","State":"open","Body":"This PR removes the confusing section - [## Style Precendece](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding#styling-precedence) - from [Class and style binding](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding) docs and adds more clarification to it in the following sections: [## Binding to multiple styles](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding#binding-to-multiple-styles) and [## Binding to multiple CSS classes](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding#binding-to-multiple-css-classes) which already contain references to [Style Precedence](https://angular.io/guide/style-precedence) docs.

I understand it is for performance improvement, But for already existing big enterprise-level applications, with many developers, it poses a big problem. Since many devs are working, an import-based circular dependency can be easily inserted in any part of the code, and with the useful 'circular dependency warnings' removed, there is no way to find such issues. And these issues may cause application to actually break in production. Which causes a huge impact on our reputation with the customer. We tried the alternatives suggested, but no luck\r\n\r\n1) Eslint -> import/no-cycle -> Makes our linter in CI run for more than 1.5 hours and finally breaks\r\n14:55:00  Linting \"@abcd/mnop-efgh\"...\r\n16:27:07  Cannot contact xyz-slave1: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\nThis is probably because our application is very big\r\n\r\n2) Madge -> Only found the type-based circular dependencies and no other circular dependencies... It is able to detect all circ-deps for a smaller application, But since our app is huge it is probably not able to find anything relevant.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1) Keep the showCircularDependencies flag for development and not have it in production. In the angular.json we can have a warning, if showCircularDependencies is set to true, stating, \"Do not use in Production as it will slow the build\".\r\n\r\n2) Angular can have another script, which after running can let us know the circular dependency warnings. This script can be based on the build, used in Angular-13 or before... which finds circular dependencies. This script will be different from the build so no performance impact will be there.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs mentioned above eslint and madge were tried, but no value was added.

[`v16.0.0-next.3`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600-next3-2023-03-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/16.0.0-next.2...16.0.0-next.3)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   The `APP_ID` token value is no longer randomly generated. If you are bootstrapping multiple application on the same page you will need to set to provide the `APP_ID` yourself.\n\n    ```ts\n    bootstrapApplication(ComponentA, {\n      providers: [\n       { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'app-a' },\n       // ... other providers ...\n      ]\n    });\n    ```\n\n##### router\n\n-   `ComponentFactoryResolver` has been removed from Router APIs.\n    Component factories are not required to create an instance of a component\n    dynamically. Passing a factory resolver via resolver argument is no longer needed\n    and code can instead use `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` without the\n    factory resolver.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `EnvironmentInjector.runInContext` is now deprecated, with\n    `runInInjectionContext` functioning as a direct replacement:\n\n    ```typescript\n    // Previous method version (deprecated):\n    envInjector.runInContext(fn);\n    // New standalone function:\n    runInInjectionContext(envInjector, fn);\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   `BrowserModule.withServerTransition` has been deprecated. `APP_ID` should be used instead to set the application ID.\n    NB: Unless, you render multiple Angular applications on the same page, setting an application ID is not necessary.\n\n    Before:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'serverApp' }),\n      ...\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    After:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule,\n      { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'serverApp' },\n      ...\n    ],\n    ```\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

The proposed solution was to add a cdkScrollable directive and a 'close' Scroll Strategy to the dropdown component used.\r\nA potential bug in Angular Material was discovered where if two nested scrollable containers exist (i.e. an overlay containing a cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport component within a scrollable window), the global scrollDispatcher would get triggered if a scroll within the dropdown occurs and this would cause the dropdown to close. Consequently, the user would never be able to scroll within the dropdown without abruptly closing it. The proposed solution for this was to inject a local scrollDispatcher instance in the overlay service, and the scroll event fired from the dropdown would not trigger the close scroll strategy.\r\nFinally, once the dropdown is closed on outside scroll, the dropdown search field should be unfocused, and for that, .detachments() was called in the overlay service.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ru7qdi-tbavjg?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.css,package.json\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe local Scroll Dispatcher instance would not be needed and scrolling within the dropdown would not trigger the closing scroll strategy, since the scroll strategy is related to scroll behavior outside of the overlay and not within it (see: https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview#scroll-strategies)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127736829/224677310-f119ff4e-5b26-4087-88c8-eec7bb65fd00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nScrolling within the dropdown overlay causes it to close.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26780","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MATERIAL): Close Scroll Strategy is triggered by scroll behavior within the overlay\" (#26780)"},{"Id":"1621003997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-13T08:45:22","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26779","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): match panel to trigger in test harness","State":"open","Body":"The tooltip harness was written the assumption that only tooltip can be shown on the page at a time, however in tests that might not be the case.

Here is a concrete example of what I mean (albeit very simple and refactorable): \r\n\r\n```ts \r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-text',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>Type some value:</div>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"value\"/>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class TextComponent {\r\n  value = signal<string>('');\r\n\r\n  private length = computed(() => this.value().length);\r\n  private length$ = toObservable(this.length);\r\n  lengthDidChange = outputFromObservable(this.length$);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * I'd like to emit any time lenght changes.\r\n   *\r\n   * Ideally:\r\n   *\r\n   * lengthDidChange = output<number>({ from: this.length });\r\n   * or\r\n   * lengthDidChange = output<number>({ from: ()=> {return ... } });\r\n   * or\r\n   * lengthDidChange = outputFrom<number>(()=> {return ... });\r\n   */\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TextComponent],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-text (lengthDidChange)=\"lengthDidChange($event)\"/>\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <div>{{ desc() }}</div>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {\r\n  length = signal<number | undefined>(undefined);\r\n  desc = computed(() => `Length is ${this.length()}`);\r\n\r\n  lengthDidChange(value: number): void {\r\n    this.length.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-lazelp?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nThe pattern is basically: any time a component `internal` signal changes => emit the new value (no need to call emit, no observables, ...). \r\n\r\nOf course, you could say: in the example above, you should use `ngModelChange`, setup a method in `TextComponent ` and emit. That's true for such example (again very simple). \r\n\r\nBut as usual, the story changes as soon as the example gets more complicated (more components, more needs to synchronise values, ...). In general, I think more complicated scenarios could be addressed by devs using `effects` (which is by the way the case with `toObservable` 😅). \r\n\r\nI hope I haven't missed anything trivial (stupidity is always around the corner 😅). \r\n\r\nThanks a lot! \r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce some sort of declarative way of creating an `output` from signals. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDepends on the use case. In general, the way to go is to have a more imperative approach to `emit`.

This is currently unused within the runtime but is an enabling feature for upcoming features such as automatic component style HMR and development server deferred stylesheet processing. Instead of inline style content that is then added to a `style` element for each host node, a `link` element with a stylesheet `rel` attribute and a `href` attribute can now be created. The development server must be configured to provide the relevant component stylesheet upon request. The Angular CLI development server will provide this functionality once this capability is enabled. Since the primary use of this capability is development mode and will not be used for production code, server (SSR) style reuse is currently not yet implemented but may be implemented in the future.\r\n\r\nA component feature is used to provide the DOM renderer access to any external styles that were emitted at compile time. When external styles are present, the `getExternalStyles` function will be present on the runtime component metadata object. The DOM render will use this function to access and encapsulate the external style URLs as required by the component.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57922","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): support external runtime styles via a component feature\" (#57922)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2544337385","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T20:57:56","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28474","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency @rollup/plugin-commonjs to v28","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs/#readme) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/HEAD/packages/commonjs)) | devDependencies | major | [`^26.0.0` -> `^28.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@rollup%2fplugin-commonjs/26.0.1/28.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/plugins (@&#8203;rollup/plugin-commonjs)</summary>\n\n### [`v28.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/HEAD/packages/commonjs/CHANGELOG.md#v2800)\n\n*2024-09-23*\n\n##### Breaking Changes\n\n-   chore: switch to fdir for fewer dependencies ([#&#8203;1741](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1741))\n\n### [`v27.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/HEAD/packages/commonjs/CHANGELOG.md#v2700)\n\n*2024-09-23*\n\n##### Breaking Changes\n\n-   feat!: default strictRequires to true ([#&#8203;1639](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1639))\n-   fix!: replace top-level this with exports name ([#&#8203;1618](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1618))\n\n### [`v26.0.3`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/HEAD/packages/commonjs/CHANGELOG.md#v2603)\n\n*2024-09-23*\n\n##### Updates\n\n-   chore: revert [#&#8203;1618](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1618) ([`e98927b`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/plugins/commit/e98927b))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Drop support for older platforms ([#&#8203;3902](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3902))\n\n    This release drops support for the following operating system:\n\n    -   macOS 10.15 Catalina\n\n    This is because the Go programming language dropped support for this operating system version in Go 1.23, and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.22 to Go 1.23. Go 1.23 now requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.\n\n    Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the esbuild npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.23). That might look something like this:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\n        cd esbuild\n        go build ./cmd/esbuild\n        ./esbuild --version\n\n-   Fix class field decorators in TypeScript if `useDefineForClassFields` is `false` ([#&#8203;3913](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3913))\n\n    Setting the `useDefineForClassFields` flag to `false` in `tsconfig.json` means class fields use the legacy TypeScript behavior instead of the standard JavaScript behavior. Specifically they use assign semantics instead of define semantics (e.g. setters are triggered) and fields without an initializer are not initialized at all. However, when this legacy behavior is combined with standard JavaScript decorators, TypeScript switches to always initializing all fields, even those without initializers. Previously esbuild incorrectly continued to omit field initializers for this edge case. These field initializers in this case should now be emitted starting with this release.\n\n-   Avoid incorrect cycle warning with `tsconfig.json` multiple inheritance ([#&#8203;3898](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3898))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 introduced multiple inheritance for `tsconfig.json` files where `extends` can be an array of file paths. Previously esbuild would incorrectly treat files encountered more than once when processing separate subtrees of the multiple inheritance hierarchy as an inheritance cycle. With this release, `tsconfig.json` files containing this edge case should work correctly without generating a warning.\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play stack overflow with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3915](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3915))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map could cause a stack overflow when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around more issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3917](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3917))\n\n    This version of Deno broke the `stdin` and `stdout` properties on command objects for inherited streams, which matters when you run esbuild's Deno module as the entry point (i.e. when `import.meta.main` is `true`). Previously esbuild would crash in Deno 1.31+ if you ran esbuild like that.

However, when using the `reset()` method with reactive forms, the form controls are unexpectedly marked as `touched` or `dirty`, causing **validation errors** to display immediately. This behavior is not intuitive and negatively impacts user experience, as the form appears to have errors even though no user interaction has occurred post-reset.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a stepper with multiple steps using Angular Material and reactive forms.\r\n2. Assign required validators to form controls in each step.\r\n3. Complete the stepper steps, then use the `reset()` method on the stepper to reset it.\r\n4. Observe that form controls are marked as `touched` or `dirty` even though the stepper was reset, and validation errors are displayed.\r\n5. Alternatively, you can also use the native `mat-stepper`: https://material.angular.io/components/stepper/examples#stepper-errors\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter calling `stepper.reset()`, all form controls should be reset to their initial state, marked as pristine and untouched. No validation errors should be displayed until the user interacts with the form controls again.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCalling `stepper.reset()` resets the stepper and form groups but marks all form controls as `touched` or `dirty`, triggering validation errors to display immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `18.1.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `18.1.1`\r\n- Browser(s): `Google Chrome`_(Version 127.0.6533.73 (Official Build) (arm64))_\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS(Sonoma 14.7)`, _Apple M1_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Stepper): Stepper `reset()` Method Marks Form Controls as `Touched/Dirty`, Triggering Validation Errors\" (#29781)"},{"Id":"2544981645","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T10:18:48","Actor":"matikowi","Number":"29780","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/datepicker): Fixed typo in date-range-picker-selection-…","State":"open","Body":"…strategy-example\r\n\r\nCurrent description is not gramatically correct","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29780","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material/datepicker): Fixed typo in date-range-picker-selection-…\" (#29780)"},{"Id":"2540752632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T06:28:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `youtube-player` to use the `inject` function instead of constructor-based injection.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function\" (#29775)"},{"Id":"2543959611","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T23:49:53","Actor":"naaajii","Number":"29779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/tabs): add `align` in `MatTabsConfig`","State":"open","Body":"users can align tabs label via config now rather than adding `mat-tab-align` property on each tab group\r\n\r\nfixes #29685","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29779","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/tabs): add `align` in `MatTabsConfig`\" (#29779)"},{"Id":"2543298796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:58:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29778","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move classes out of core","State":"open","Body":"* Moves the mat-app-background class out of core\r\n* Moves the mat-elevation-* classes out of core","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: move classes out of core\" (#29778)"},{"Id":"2537084758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:53:39","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29766","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move mat-elevation-* classes out of core","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29766","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: move mat-elevation-* classes out of core\" (#29766)"},{"Id":"2537061637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:53:35","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29765","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move mat-app-background out of core","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29765","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: move mat-app-background out of core\" (#29765)"},{"Id":"2536505461","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:41:16","Actor":"btiller123","Number":"29764","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): The documented example for creating a flat tree used deprecated controls","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nAccording to the release notes for 18.2.0 in https://github.com/angular/components/releases, many tree controls have been deprecated which my IDE shows the same as well.

This isn't right because `[formControl]` directives are intended to be used without a `ControlContainer`. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be caused by `NgControlStatusGroup` having too broad of a selector, so that it activates on all `form` tags. \r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n- You can circumvent the problem by adding `ngNoForm` to the parent `<form>` tag, but that is not intuitive\r\n- You can also work around the problem by adding the `FormsModule` so `NgForm` is automatically created. However, this isn't really correct because it requires mixing the forms modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-cke9q5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\nIf you load that Stackblitz, you can see the error in the console.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\npreview-e378c6d150742202f755b.js:1 ERROR Error: NodeInjector: NOT_FOUND [ControlContainer]\r\n    at getOrCreateInjectable (core.umd.js:4047)\r\n    at Object.…µ…µdirectiveInject (core.umd.js:14362)\r\n    at NodeInjectorFactory.NgControlStatusGroup_Factory [as factory] (forms.umd.js:1058)\r\n    at getNodeInjectable (core.umd.js:4141)\r\n    at instantiateAllDirectives (core.umd.js:8464)\r\n    at createDirectivesInstances (core.umd.js:7831)\r\n    at Object.…µ…µelementStart (core.umd.js:14511)\r\n    at AppComponent_Template (app.component.ts:18)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.umd.js:7804)\r\n    at renderView (core.umd.js:7613)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nIvy, v10\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't use a <form> tag with a [formControl] directive\" (#38391)"},{"Id":"675716514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-09T17:56:57","Actor":"anjneeksharma","Number":"38390","RawContent":null,"Title":"can not import module after upgrading Angular 10 from Angular 9","State":"closed","Body":"Upgraded to Angular 10 from 9 now i am getting some import error even after installing those module.\r\nBellow are the module which i am not able to import.\r\n\r\nimport { ApolloModule} from 'apollo-angular';\r\nimport { HttpLinkModule} from 'apollo-angular/http';\r\n\r\nbut i can import  import {HttpLink} from 'apollo-angular/http';  \r\n\r\nPlease help me.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38390","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"can not import module after upgrading Angular 10 from Angular 9\" (#38390)"},{"Id":"675684403","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-09T11:35:54","Actor":"PatrickJS","Number":"38388","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(elements): lazily check matches","State":"open","Body":"fixes #24551\r\n\r\nsame code as \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d1ea1f4c7f3358b730b0d94e65b00bc28cae279c/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component_adapter.ts#L291-L299\r\nwithout the global check\r\n\r\nsimpler version of another PR\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37799","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38388","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(elements): lazily check matches\" (#38388)"},{"Id":"675490747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-08T08:56:44","Actor":"ajitsinghkaler","Number":"38385","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: keep tables in order","State":"open","Body":"The things that are explained in first table are there in\r\nsecond table while explaining the structural directive microsyntax\r\nSo the second table should preceed the first table\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Reproduced at least since in 10.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter turning off bundleDependencies, one single app module cannot be resolved: `\"../../../utils\"`.\r\nExact name and path matter. I feel kind of weird just as I write this...\r\n\r\n**Following minor changes to the setup magically fix the problem:**\r\n- moving the module one level up in dir structure\r\n- renaming it into e.g \"util2\" \r\n- renaming `utils/index.ts` into e.g. `utils/some-file.ts` else and importing from this file directly\r\n- importing it from another location (so that relative import path becomes different)\r\n\r\n**Following changes do not fix the problem though:**\r\n- changing from `../../../utils.ts` to `../../../utils/index.ts` (which resolves the same, based on node module resolution rules)\r\n- change import path from `../../../utils` to `../../../utils/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n- Create a fresh angular 10 project, add universal as per the docs\r\n- **Add `\"bundleDependencies\": false` to the server builder options**\r\n- Create \"app/utils.ts\" put an empty class inside and export it\r\n```\r\n// app/utils.ts\r\nexport class Utils {}\r\n```\r\n- Create a component nested 3 levels down from `app`, declare it in AppModule\r\n- in this component, import the class and try to instantiate it right away (or try to inject into the component, if it was declared as injectable):\r\n```\r\n// app/feature1/components/test/test.component.ts\r\nimport {Component} from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport {Utils} from \"../../../utils\";\r\n\r\nconst utils = new Utils();\r\n\r\n@Component({template: \"\"})\r\nexport class TestComponent {}\r\n```\r\nWe end up with the following dir structure:\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n  - feature1/\r\n    - components/\r\n      - test/\r\n        - test.component.ts\r\n  utils.ts\r\n```\r\n- Ok, we're done.

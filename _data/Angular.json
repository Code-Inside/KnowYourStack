'rtl' : 'ltr'\"` on the root.\r\n    **Problem:** Doesn't cover Material dialogs, since they're under document `body`, not under `app.component` subtree.\r\n\r\n2. `@Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document` and set: `document.documentElement.dir = getLocaleDirection(locale);`\r\n    **Problem:** Even though that's supposed to cover dialogs, dialogs are rendered messed up. I guess Angular Material's dialog container reads the `html dir` before it gets updated by app.component or something (because if you set `dir=\"rtl\"` manually in `index.html` instead of dynamically, dialogs work just fine).\r\n\r\n3. `<html i18n-dir dir=\"rtl\">` in `index.html`.\r\n    **Problem:** Doesn't work because index.html isn't a component, so isn't covered by Angular i18n.\r\n\r\n4. CSS override `html[lang=ar] .cdk-global-overlay-wrapper { direction: rtl; }`.\r\n    **Problem:** [`flex-layout`](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) margins inside the dialog get flipped wrong.\r\n\r\n5. Having different `index.html` files for different languages.\r\n    **Problem:** Major code duplication just to change one attribute.\r\n\r\n6. Adding a `<head>` script to set the `html dir` attribute based on the `lang` attribute:\r\n  `<script>document.documentElement.dir = ['ar', 'he'].includes(document.documentElement.lang) ?

`async` arrow functions ([#&#8203;1777](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1777))\n\n    This release fixes an edge case that was missed when lowering `async` arrow functions containing `super` property accesses for compile targets that don't support `async` such as with `--target=es6`. The problem was that lowering transforms `async` arrow functions into generator function expressions that are then passed to an esbuild helper function called `__async` that implements the `async` state machine behavior. Since function expressions do not capture `this` and `super` like arrow functions do, this led to a mismatch in behavior which meant that the transform was incorrect. The fix is to introduce a helper function to forward `super` access into the generator function expression body. Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() { return async () => super.bar() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() {\n        return () => __async(this, null, function* () {\n          return super.bar();\n        });\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() {\n        return () => {\n          var __superGet = (key) => super[key];\n          return __async(this, null, function* () {\n            return __superGet(\"bar\").call(this);\n          });\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid merging certain CSS rules with different units ([#&#8203;1732](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1732))\n\n    This release no longer collapses `border-radius`, `margin`, `padding`, and `inset` rules when they have units with different levels of browser support. Collapsing multiple of these rules into a single rule is not equivalent if the browser supports one unit but not the other unit, since one rule would still have applied before the collapse but no longer applies after the collapse due to the whole rule being ignored. For example, Chrome 10 supports the `rem` unit but not the `vw` unit, so the CSS code below should render with rounded corners in Chrome 10. However, esbuild previously merged everything into a single rule which would cause Chrome 10 to ignore the rule and not round the corners. This issue is now fixed:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original CSS */\n    div {\n      border-radius: 1rem;\n      border-top-left-radius: 1vw;\n      margin: 0;\n      margin-top: 1Q;\n      left: 10Q;\n      top: 20Q;\n      right: 10Q;\n      bottom: 20Q;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    div{border-radius:1vw 1rem 1rem;margin:1Q 0 0;inset:20Q 10Q}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    div{border-radius:1rem;border-top-left-radius:1vw;margin:0;margin-top:1Q;inset:20Q 10Q}\n    ```\n\n    Notice how esbuild can still collapse rules together when they all share the same unit, even if the unit is one that doesn't have universal browser support such as the unit `Q`. One subtlety is that esbuild now distinguishes between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" units where safe units are old enough that they are guaranteed to work in any browser a user might reasonably use, such as `px`. Safe units are allowed to be collapsed together even if there are multiple different units while multiple different unsafe units are not allowed to be collapsed together. Another detail is that esbuild no longer minifies zero lengths by removing the unit if the unit is unsafe (e.g. `0rem` into `0`) since that could cause a rendering difference if a previously-ignored rule is now no longer ignored due to the unit change. If you are curious, you can learn more about browser support levels for different CSS units in [Mozilla's documentation about CSS length units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length).\n\n-   Avoid warning about ignored side-effect free imports for empty files ([#&#8203;1785](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1785))\n\n    When bundling, esbuild warns about bare imports such as `import \"lodash-es\"` when the package has been marked as `\"sideEffects\": false` in its `package.json` file. This is because the only reason to use a bare import is because you are relying on the side effects of the import, but imports for packages marked as side-effect free are supposed to be removed. If the package indicates that it has no side effects, then this bare import is likely a bug.\n\n    However, some people have packages just for TypeScript type definitions. These package can actually have a side effect as they can augment the type of the global object in TypeScript, even if they are marked with `\"sideEffects\": false`. To avoid warning in this case, esbuild will now only issue this warning if the imported file is non-empty. If the file is empty, then it's irrelevant whether you import it or not so any import of that file does not indicate a bug. This fixes this case because `.d.ts` files typically end up being empty after esbuild parses them since they typically only contain type declarations.\n\n-   Attempt to fix packages broken due to the `node:` prefix ([#&#8203;1760](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1760))\n\n    Some people have started using the node-specific `node:` path prefix in their packages. This prefix forces the following path to be interpreted as a node built-in module instead of a package on the file system. So `require(\"node:path\")` will always import [node's `path` module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) and never import [npm's `path` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path).\n\n    Adding the `node:` prefix breaks that code with older node versions that don't understand the `node:` prefix. This is a problem with the package, not with esbuild. The package should be adding a fallback if the `node:` prefix isn't available. However, people still want to be able to use these packages with older node versions even though the code is broken. Now esbuild will automatically strip this prefix if it detects that the code will break in the configured target environment (as specified by `--target=`). Note that this only happens during bundling, since import paths are only examined during bundling.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n###

There's even [documentation](https://angular.io/guide/web-worker) on how to do it and is as simple as running `ng generate web-worker app` 🎉 .\r\n\r\nI wanted to use a [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) to synchronize data between multiple open tabs. But apparently, `SharedWorker` does not work out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis is not a duplicate of https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14871 because it's not about rendering applications with a web worker. It's about adding support to add support for `SharedWorker` in an Angular application.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAccording to [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64495078) it should be possible if it was turned on in the Angular CLI webpack config by setting [`sharedWorker`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin#sharedworker-boolean) to `true`.\r\n\r\nAs a nice addition, there could be a `--shared` flag added to the `ng generate web-worker` command so it generates a chunk of code that makes sense for SharedWorkers. Something like this.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (typeof SharedWorker !== 'undefined') {\r\n  // Create a new\r\n  const worker = new SharedWorker(new URL('./app.worker', import.meta.url).toString());\r\n  worker.port.onmessage = ({ data }) => {\r\n    console.log(`page got message: ${data}`);\r\n  };\r\n  worker.port.postMessage('hello');\r\n} else {\r\n  // Shared web workers are not supported in this environment.\r\n  // You should add a fallback so that your program still executes correctly.\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAn alternative right now is to use a [custom webpack loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin#loader), which is not really super DX friendly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22204","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add support for SharedWorkers\" (#22204)"},{"Id":"1058691050","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-19T16:09:19","Actor":"clydin","Number":"22203","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): ask to install angular-eslint when running ng lint in new projects","State":"open","Body":"To improve the developer experience for the `ng lint` command in new projects, the lint command will now ask the developer if they wish to install `@angular-eslint/schematics` when no lint target has been configured for the specified project. `@angular-eslint/schematics` is currently the only option listed in the warning shown prior to the introduction of the prompt in this change.

The ensured that when running that the runner used to run the update contains the latest bug fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\nThis however, can be problematic in some cases.

Example: `ng update @angular/core@12`,  the update will run on most recent patch version of `@angular/cli` of that major version `@12.2.6`.\r\n- When updating an `@angular/` or `@nguniversal/` and no target version is specified. Example: `ng update @angular/core` the update will run on most latest version of the `@angular/cli`.\r\n- When updating a third-party package, the most recent patch version of the installed `@angular/cli` will be used to run the update.

We propose an additional option that allows to load the files with an unique query parameter. This is an effective solution against the following problems that can occur:\r\n\r\n#### Cached index.html file with old bundle files removed\r\nWhen an user loads the page with an cached index.html file it will try to load also the old assets files. These are default hashed in the following pattern `<bundle_name>.<hash>.js`. The server will that respond with an 404 because these files are removed and can't be served. This is an ongoing issue because of lazy loading not all bundle files are loaded at the first page view.\r\n\r\n#### New index.html file with old bundle files partially cached\r\nAlmost the same problem described as above but we have noticed that in some conditions the browsers is loading the new index.html and javascript files but still is caching the css files.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe would like to have an option to allow to set an custom query parameter when loading the files. When output hashing is set on `none` the file name should be in these form: `<bundle_name>.js` but the file should be loading using an GET request in the following format: `<bundle_name>.js?<version_number>`.\r\n\r\nYou will see that this is an addition to output hasing because you can also have the following file name `<bundle_name>.<hash>.js` and loading the file in the following way: `<bundle_name>.<hash>.js?<version_number>`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nUsing other caching control options but this doesn't complete solve the problem. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22197","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow to load the bundle and asset files with specefic query parameters in addition of output hashing \" (#22197)"},{"Id":"1058270745","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-19T08:29:43","Actor":"sd-buddy","Number":"22196","RawContent":null,"Title":"Removed","State":"closed","Body":"Can be removed","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Removed\" (#22196)"},{"Id":"1058251572","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-19T08:02:04","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"22195","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f280f9d` -> `75f43ef` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `3107fc6` -> `f50fd73` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f6e0d41` -> `f9cda89` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `6050e86` -> `35eeca6` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `338f5e0` -> `7b6f976` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c8bb136` -> `224dcbc` |\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `c55a393` -> `74fb4de` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `50d72af` -> `eb6b4de` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `9943055` -> `ce15b7d` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e437091` -> `c3c2479` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material2-builds) | dependencies | digest | `861cf89` -> `0855c00` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `91edcf5` -> `47857bc` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5f460ec` -> `b6a4d4d` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c449476` -> `1ef2581` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ac97ca2` -> `2700d36` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f01dd87` -> `3ec5b43` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `012cf44` -> `cb6a133` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f0f363c` -> `c2fb49a` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This type argument is forwarded in `open`. However, the type is never tied in anyway to the actual component, making the type argument an essentially useless type assertion.\r\n\r\nWhile due to the nature of Angular's dependency injection full type-safety cannot be achieved, it would be nice if at least the dialog component could declare the type it receives itself in such a way that a call to `open` will infer the correct type automatically. In order to achieve this, the dialog component needs to somehow expose this information. Here are a few possible solutions in no particular order, though others might exist:\r\n\r\n#### Interface with type inference\r\n\r\nWe could define an interface and a helper type as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MatDialogHasData<T> {\r\n  data: T;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype ExtractDialogDataType<T> = T extends MatDialogHasData<infer D> ? D : any;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then adjust the type signature of `open` to infer the type accordingly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen<T, R = any>(\r\n  component: ComponentType<T>, \r\n  data?: MatDialogConfig<ExtractDialogDataType<T>>\r\n): MatDialogReg<T, R>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, a dialog component would be required to have a public field named `data` of the according type, which would typically be achieved through the injection itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor(@Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public data: MyDialogDataType) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note*: This change _is_ breaking because the generic signature of `open` changes and because dialog components could have an unrelated `data` field which would lead to an unintended type inference. Unfortunately we cannot prevent this here due to TypeScript's structural typing nature. In particular users would no longer be able to manually define the generic type argument. However see further below for a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n#### Interface with explicit method\r\n\r\nInstead, we could also introduce an interface with an explicit method to be implemented:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MatDialogHasData<T> {\r\n  getDialogData(): T\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the approach is largely similar. This change is only breaking in the generic type signature (I'm not sure whether you count this as a breaking change), however we could actually avoid that by changing our helper type to\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype ExtractDialogDataType<T, FALLBACK> = T extends MatDialogHasData<infer D> ? D : FALLBACK;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then using the type argument as a fallback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen<T, D = any, R = any>(\r\n  component: ComponentType<T>, \r\n  data?: MatDialogConfig<ExtractDialogDataType<T, D>>\r\n): MatDialogReg<T, R>\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note*: The same could be done in the solution above. I believe we could make this a completely backwards-compatible change, excluding of course the exotic situation that a component happens to already have a `getDialogData` method for unrelated reasons. The only disadvantage here is forcing the component to provide a public method. In practice I don't consider this a concern as Angular already forces us to make many things public that shouldn't be public from a component API perspective.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a very similar note, it would be nice to have the same for the inferred result type `R`, i.e. the component being able to define the type of data it can return, and have this information flow through the `open` method to the caller. The approaches mentioned above could, in theory, cover this as well.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nGiven some `MyDialogComponent` which expects dialog data of type `MyDialogData`, I would like\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen(MyDialogComponent, {\r\n  data: {\r\n    // …\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nto type-check `data` against `MyDialogData` without having to manually specify `open`'s type arguments, but rather have this information flow from `MyDialogComponent`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23985","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(dialog): Dialogs can define the type for their dialog data\" (#23985)"},{"Id":"1057695341","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-18T18:58:36","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"23983","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-infra: can't build project or run dev-app on MacBooks with m1 CPUs","State":"open","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI've switched to an m1Max MacBook Pro as my main device now.\r\n\r\nI've got Bazel 4.2.1 installed locally, but the build seems to be trying to install Bazel 4.0.0 and failing.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 13 57 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/142479285-bfda7541-602b-41d8-94f5-02ce392bb6b2.png)\r\n\r\n1.

If the event fires before 500ms, we clear the timeout so users don't have to flush it in tests, however we had the following problems:\r\n1. Transparent backdrops don't have a transition so they were always being cleaned up after the 500ms timeout.\r\n2. We weren't clearing the timeout if the overlay was disposed while the backdrop transition is running. This meant that the timeout would still be in memory, even though the element was removed from the DOM.\r\n3. We had a memory leak where the `click` and `transitionend` events weren't being removed from the backdrop if the overlay is disposed while detaching.\r\n\r\nBasically all Material components had one of these issues. These changes resolve the problems by:\r\n1. Clearing the timeout when the overlay is disposed.\r\n2. Setting a 1ms transition on the transparent overlay so its `transitionend` can fire (almost) instantly.\r\n3.

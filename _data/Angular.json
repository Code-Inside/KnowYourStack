This shows how many other repositories on GitHub are dependent on that repository. Angular‚Äôs GitHub repo hasn‚Äôt enabled this feature yet, but React currently shows almost 4,000,000 while Vue shows over 93,000. Quite a difference between the two, but this is largely due to Vue being the newer framework and doesn‚Äôt tell the full picture on overall demand.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nI would like you to follow the steps [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58461512/how-to-use-the-used-by-button-in-the-github-repository) to enable the github feature called \"used by\". \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\n1.

The `$keys` form a path to the nested map in `$map`, into\n    which `$value` is inserted.\n\n    See [the Sass documentation][map-set] for more details.\n\n    [map-set]&#x3A; <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#set>\n\n-   Add support for nested maps to `map.get()`.\n    For example, `map.get((a: (b: (c: d))), a, b, c)` would return `d`.\n    See [the documentation][map-get] for more details.\n\n    [map-get]&#x3A; <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#get>\n\n-   Add support for nested maps in `map.has-key`.\n    For example, `map.has-key((a: (b: (c: d))), a, b, c)` would return true.\n    See [the documentation][map-has-key] for more details.\n\n    [map-has-key]&#x3A; <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#has-key>\n\n-   Add a `map.deep-merge()` function. This works like `map.merge()`, except that\n    nested map values are _also_ recursively merged. For example:\n\n        map.deep-merge(\n          (color: (primary: red, secondary: blue),\n          (color: (secondary: teal)\n        ) // => (color: (primary: red, secondary: teal))\n\n    See [the Sass documentation][map-deep-merge] for more details.\n\n    [map-deep-merge]&#x3A; <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#deep-merge>\n\n-   Add a `map.deep-remove()` function. This allows you to remove keys from\n    nested maps by passing multiple keys. For example:\n\n        map.deep-remove(\n          (color: (primary: red, secondary: blue)),\n          color, primary\n        ) // => (color: (secondary: blue))\n\n    See [the Sass documentation][map-deep-remove] for more details.\n\n    [map-deep-remove]&#x3A; <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#deep-remove>\n\n-   Fix a bug where custom property values in plain CSS were being parsed as\n    normal property values.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add a `Value.tryMap()` function which returns the `Value` as a `SassMap` if\n    it's a valid map, or `null` otherwise. This allows function authors to safely\n    retrieve maps even if they're internally stored as empty lists, without having\n    to catch exceptions from `Value.assertMap()`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/11.0.0-next.4...11.0.0-next.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **common:** add boolean to valid json for testing ([#&#8203;37893](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37893)) ([3c474ec](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3c474ec)), closes [#&#8203;20690](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/20690)\n-   **core:** use single quotes for relative link resolution migration to align with style guide ([#&#8203;39070](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39070)) ([8894706](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8894706))\n-   **forms:** improve types of directive constructor arguments ([#&#8203;38944](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38944)) ([246de9a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/246de9a))\n-   **forms:** include null in .parent of abstract control ([#&#8203;32671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/32671)) ([f4f1bcc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f4f1bcc)), closes [#&#8203;16999](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/16999)\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] hybrid visitor should not locate let keyword ([#&#8203;39061](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39061)) ([70e13dc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/70e13dc))\n-   **router:** properly assign ExtraOptions to Router in RouterTestingModule ([#&#8203;39096](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39096)) ([d8c0534](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d8c0534)), closes [#&#8203;23347](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/23347)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** support getting resource dependencies for a source file ([#&#8203;38048](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38048)) ([5dbf357](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5dbf357))\n-   **forms:** add migration for AbstractControl.parent accesses ([#&#8203;39009](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39009)) ([aeec223](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/aeec223)), closes [#&#8203;32671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/32671)\n-   **language-service:** Add getDefinitionAndBoundSpan (go to definition) ([#&#8203;39101](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39101)) ([3975dd9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3975dd9))\n-   **language-service:** add quick info for inline templates in ivy ([#&#8203;39060](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39060)) ([904adb7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/904adb7))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **forms:** Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of `validators` and\n    `asyncValidators` arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your\n    code relies on directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety.\n-   **forms:** Type of AbstractFormControl.parent now includes null\n\n`null` is now included in the types of .parent. If you don't already have a check for this case,\nthe TypeScript compiler might compain. A v11 migration exists which adds the not-null assertion\noperator where necessary.\n\nIn an unlikely case your code was testing the parnet against undefined with sitrct equality,\nyou'll need to change this to `=== null` instead, since the parent is not explicily initialized\nwith `null` instead of being left `undefined`.\n\n#### 10.1.5 (2020-10-07)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **router:** update getRouteGuards to check if the context outlet is activated ([#&#8203;39049](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39049)) ([771f731](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/771f731)), closes [#&#8203;39030](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39030)\n-   **compiler:** Recover on malformed keyed reads and keyed writes ([#&#8203;39004](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39004)) ([f50313f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f50313f)), closes [#&#8203;38596](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38596)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The first (menu) bottom sheet applies 'cdk-global-scrollblock'. When the other one is opened, the background is not scrollable anymore (because of the blocking class), so it removes it again, making the page in the background scrollable again.\r\n\r\nMy use case is only with bottom sheets, but since the similar issue, https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16864, describes the same problem, I assume dialogs and bottom sheets work the same in this behaviour.

It would be cool if template editor supported standard way how deprecated code should be marked in TS/JS, using JSDoc [@deprecated](https://github.com/deprecated) feature. This would help working in enterprise grade environment when there are multiple components and some of these should no longer be used. Currently it is very easy to forget/overlook such usage. Displaying it somehow in editor in straightforward way would help a lot.\n> \n> ### Feature Type\n> Display somehow that component is deprecated.\n> \n> ### Describe the solution you'd like\n> I believe the standard way of displaying would be fine, similar way as vscode does for TS/JS code. Currently WebStorm supports it and it looks like in the screenshot: ![image](https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/assets/68107706/96a3d6f6-725c-4cf6-84b6-dd5074d50531)\n> \n> It supports standard way of marking elements as deprecated using JSDoc [@deprecated](https://github.com/deprecated) feature. For example:\n> \n> /**\n>  * @deprecated DO NOT USE THIS TABLE.\n>  */\n> @Component({\n>   selector: 'app-table-old',\n>   templateUrl: './old-table.component.html',\n>   styleUrls: ['./old-table.component.scss']\n> })\n\nFYI @Mr1008\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis could be implemented as a rule that provides diagnostics with deprecated tags that are then shown in the IDE, similar as happens in Typescript files.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo alternatives in VS Code.\n\nThe functionality seems to be available in Webstorm, sounds like they have a forked or extended version of the language service. It would be good to have this in the base language service so more IDEs can have this functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59343","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Show deprecated template items in IDE\" (#59343)"},{"Id":"2764513164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T16:14:15","Actor":"imran8811","Number":"59342","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken link in docs","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\n<img width=\"658\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1b4476-3b2e-4fcb-a7ee-f0f8974583e3\" />\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Broken link in docs\" (#59342)"},{"Id":"2764415596","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T14:10:21","Actor":"kajal-neema","Number":"59341","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 19/18 build is not taking any new file to the build and just generating artifact from the existing files","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI am trying to create a new project through angular version 19/18 , and after npm install , i run he ng serve... so if icreate any new component this change is not detected by angular but if i change the existing file like app.component.ts its detecting the code changes\nFacing thiss issue since yesterday only earlier it was working \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo error but any new  file is not detected and not getting build as well\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... google-maps, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.2\n@schematics/angular             19.0.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.8\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59341","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 19/18 build is not taking any new file to the build and just generating artifact from the existing files\" (#59341)"},{"Id":"2764263513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T11:53:16","Actor":"walid385","Number":"59340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"Added:\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless\r\n\r\nCloses [59339](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59339)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Prior to Angular 19, the same setup worked perfectly without any issues.\n\nI initially suspected it could be related to my specific project setup. However, creating a fresh Angular project and integrating Capacitor leads to the same blank page issue, indicating it might be related to Angular 19 compatibility with Capacitor.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate a new Angular project:\n\n```\nng new capacitor-test\ncd capacitor-test\nng add @capacitor/core\nnpm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios\n\n```\nConfigure the capacitor.config.ts file as follows:\n\n```\nimport type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';\n\nconst config: CapacitorConfig = {\n  appId: 'com.test.app',\n  appName: 'CapacitorTest',\n  webDir: 'dist/capacitor-test/browser/',\n  loggingBehavior: 'debug',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nBuild the project:\n\n`ng build --output-path=dist/capacitor-test/browser/`\n\nAdd the Android platform and run the app on a connected device:\n\n```\nnpx cap add android\nnpx cap sync android\nnpx cap open android\n```\n\nObserve the application output on the device.

This validator checks if the value of a form control matches one of the allowed values from a list, which can be an array of numbers, strings, or an object.\n\nThe validator would return an error object if the value of the control is not included in the allowed values list, and it will include both the invalid value and the allowed values in the response.\n\nThis feature can be useful when you want to restrict input to a specific set of values but need the flexibility to support different types (numbers, strings, or objects).\n\n### Feature Details:\n\n1. **Validator Function:**\n\n```typescript\nexport function oneOfValidator(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  const values: number[] | string[] = toOneOfList(value);\n\n  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {\n    // Check if the control is valid and has a value\n    if (control && control.value) {\n      const value: string = control.value;\n\n      // Check if the control's value is not in the list of allowed values\n      if (!value.includes(value)) {\n        // Return an object containing the invalid value and allowed values\n        return { oneOf: value, allowedValues: values };\n      }\n    }\n    // Return null if the value is valid or the control is not set\n    return null;\n  };\n}\n\nstatic oneOf(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  return oneOfValidator(value);\n}\n\nfunction toOneOfList(value: number[] | string[] | object): number[] | string[] {\n  let valuesArray: number[] | string[] = [];\n  if (typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = Object.keys(value);\n  } else if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = value;\n  }\n  return valuesArray;\n}\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### Simple Usage Example:\n\n```typescript\n// Using oneOf with an array of numbers\noneOf([1, 2, 3]);\n\n// Using oneOf with an array of strings\noneOf(['a', 'b', 'c']);\n\n// Using oneOf with an enum\nenum Gender {\n  Male = 'Male',\n  Female = 'Female',\n  Other = 'Other'\n}\n\noneOf(Gender);\n````\n\n### Alternatives Considered:\n\n1. Custom ngModel Validator: Considered implementing a custom validator for each form control directly in the component. However, this would lead to more verbose code and less reusability across different form controls.\n\n2. Manual Value Checking in Components: Another option was manually checking if the control's value is in the allowed list within the component, but this would require repetitive code and diminish maintainability.\n\n3. Third-Party Validation Libraries: Considered using external libraries for form validation, but chose not to introduce dependencies, preferring to keep the solution within Angular's built-in form validation system for simplicity and consistency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add `oneOfValidator` for validating control values against a set of allowed values\" (#59332)"},{"Id":"2762971809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T10:44:55","Actor":"mshavliuk","Number":"59330","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested `@if` breaks multi-slot content projection","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using nested `@if` control flow blocks with content projection (`<ng-content select=\"...\">`), the projected content does not get correctly selected compared to using a single `@if`. Instead, it falls back into the default `<ng-content />` element if one exists or doesn't get injected at all otherwise.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n1. Create an `app-clild` component with content projection using `<ng-content select=\".slot\">`.\n2.

After switching to V19 I wanted to move to `AngularNodeAppEngine` to be able to have hybrid rendering but I'm facing an issue with dynamic route paths.\n\nThe app we are working on, by default, has no pre-defined route paths. They all come from an API. The end user can edit all the slugs of its app on a dedicated interface.\n\nSo, during `APP_INITIALIZER` we fetch the routes from the API and `Router.resetConfig`.\nThis is working using `CommonEngine`.\n\nBut it doesn't when using AngularNodeAppEngine because of the route extraction phase during build time to feed the Manifest in this scenario.\n\nWhen the app is built, let's say the end user has only activated one route `routeA`. The server manifest has only a route.\n\nBut after some time, the end user chose to add another route to the app (`routeB`). During `APP_INITIALIZER` the route is correctly added to the router config, but since it's not part of the manifest, `routeB` leads to a 404 on SSR.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI added a repo to highlight the issue : https://github.com/jimjim2a/ssr-dynamic-routing.\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue : \n\n1. Build the app -> at this time route extraction knows only \"article\" route\n2. open the \"/article\" page -> During app initializer we now add a second route (\"video\")\n3. Click on the \"Go to Video page !\" button -> This works since the second route is added on CSR\n4. Refresh the \"/video\" page -> This path can not be found and leads to a 404\n\nWe are in case there both SSR and CSR Router has correct configuration, but since the manifest extracted during build time is not complete, the SSR of the newly added route leads to 404.\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\nThanks everyone for all the great Job you're doing !","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29238","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AngularNodeAppEngine : dynamic route paths added with Router.resetConfig during AppInitializer can't be reached on SSR\" (#29238)"},{"Id":"2764244023","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T04:41:37","Actor":"arkthur","Number":"29239","RawContent":null,"Title":"tsconfig.spec.json types are not being resolved when opening testing files in VSCode","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIn an Angular project created by CLI, there are three tsconfig files: the base one, the app one and the tests (spec) one. Since Angular has been moving towards esbuild and Vite to build its apps, I'm trying Vitest to run its unit tests. For this, I'm using the integration made by Analog.js (https://analogjs.org/docs/features/testing/vitest).\n\nEverything works fine testing-wise, but in VSCode, and after I removed every package related to any other test runner (karma and jasmine in this case), when I open any ´src/**/*.spec.ts´ file, there are error concerning typing not being resolved for every global testing function, like ´describe´, ´it´ or ´expect´, even though, and as per instructed, ´vitest/globals´ are being correctly referenced in the ´tsconfig.spec.json´.\n\nWhen I open any testing file, aside of the errors, VSCode tells me the config file it's using to resolve this file is the base one (tsconfig.json). And, if I add ´vitest/globals´ to the base config, errors disappear.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-kgrhhncg\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nCannot find name 'describe'.

Are you trying to bundle for node? You can use \"platform: 'node'\" to do that, which will remove this error.\n\n\n\nTherefore, my issues are:\n\n1. SSG should have some sort of way to load static assets. \n2.

This project contains ten thousand components, which are distributed into one hundred modules. These codes take up approximately 20MB of disk space. When I execute the default dev-server builder, it takes about 300 seconds or so. Then, when performing an incremental build after modifying the files for the first time, it also takes around 300 seconds to complete the build. And the incremental compilation time after modifying the files later is about 15 seconds or so. Moreover, it occupies a huge amount of memory. The processes of Node.js and Esbuild take up approximately 14GB of memory.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/xjlzy/test.git\nThis is the git repository address of my local test code. You just need to run it and you'll be able to know the specific situation.

However, when the same functionality is moved to an imported function in a separate file, the build fails with the error: **\"An error occurred while extracting routes.\"**\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**1. Create an API route directly in server.ts(works fine during build):**\n\n```\napp.get('/api/ping', (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  return res.json({\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    message: 'Ok'\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Refactor the response logic into a separate file, ping.controller.ts:**\n\n```\nexport default () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        uptime: process.uptime(),\n        message: 'Ok'\n      });\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**3. Import and use the ping.controller.ts function in server.ts(throws error during build)**\n\n```\nimport pingResponse from './controllers/ping.controller';\n\napp.get('/api/ping', async (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp: any = await pingResponse();\n  return res.json(resp);\n});\n\n```\n\n**4. Generate build using:**\n\n`npm run build`\n\n**5. angular.json config**\n\n```\n\"server\": \"src/main.server.ts\",\n\"outputMode\": \"server\",\n\"ssr\": {\n  \"entry\": \"src/server.ts\"\n}\n\n```\nI cannot move all the functions internally as all my routes rely on repository-based database queries, which are modular and imported from separate files. How to resolve this issue and ensure the Angular SSR build works with these imported functions?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

However, all components appear too dark regardless of the target color, and there is no single-line solution to specify a base color tone for all components since `--mat-sys-primary` is hardcoded to the tone value `40` by the theme mixin.\n\nUnfortunately, with Material v19, picking colors from the theme no longer works. You can still specify a material theme using `$app-theme: mat.define-theme(...)` with some restrictions, but applying it using the new mixin `@include mat.theme($app-theme)` doesn't work.\n\n**So please provide clean and simple solution to:**\n\n**1. Specify and reuse a theme object**\nFor example:\n```scss\n// Define theme object\n$app_theme: mat.define-theme((\n color: (primary: $primary-palette), \n...\n)); // Like it was in Material 18\n\n// then use this theme object to apply theme or get theme color:\n@include mat.theme($app-theme);\n$theme-color: mat.get-theme-color($app-theme, primary, 70);\n\n```\n**2. Specify a base color tone for all components at once**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme((\n    color: (\n      theme-type: light,\n      primary: themes.$app-theme-palette, // Generated color palette\n      primary-color-tone: 70 // Here we specify which tone level to pick from color palette for --mat-sys-primary color\n      ...\n    )\n  ));\n```\n**_or as an alternative_** output all theme-palette tones as css variables, so we can easily reuse them to customize theme and component colors:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme-overrides((\n    primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-70),\n    on-primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-100)\n  ));\n\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    background-color: var(--mat-sys-primary-80); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n\n```\n\n**3. Specify a base color for a specific component (single-line override)**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    base-color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 30); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(all theming): Clean and reusable way to override all components theme colors\" (#30244)"},{"Id":"2755453289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T19:01:34","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30228","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): don't mark as touched when blurred while dropdown is open","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the timepicker was marking itself as touched too early when clicking on an item in the dropdown.\r\n\r\nFixes #30223.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30228","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/timepicker): don't mark as touched when blurred while dropdown is open\" (#30228)"},{"Id":"2758619023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T19:01:18","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30234","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/menu): not responding to position changes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the CDK menu wasn't updating its position strategy after the first open.\r\n\r\nFixes #30145.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30234","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/menu): not responding to position changes\" (#30234)"},{"Id":"2761159316","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T18:19:54","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"30242","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(cdk/table): Use afterNextRender for sticky styling.

An ideal solution would be:\n```\n@include mat.chips-color(#FF0000); // <== We could pass any color here and the mixin would compute the tones\n```\n\nIf not doable, then the same behavior as v18 would be good enough:\n```\n@include mat.chips-color(theme.$palettes, tertiary);\n// or\n$tertiary-palette: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary);\n@include mat.chips-color($tertiary-palette);\n```\n\nThere should be one `mat.<component>-color` mixin for each material component.\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(all): Mixins for changing component color\" (#30241)"},{"Id":"2760624124","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T09:15:39","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"30240","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(all): Add doc for mixins","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nAdd documentation for all the mixins and explain what they are used for and what the parameters are.

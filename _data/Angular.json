To speed things up I build the Angular front-end GUI directly in the local installed Chrome browser (Version 87.0.4280.141, 64-bit) by running `ng s` and then opening the Ng server at `http://localhost:4200` - everything is working as it should, and I rarely had to manually call ChangeDetection to propagate new comp changes to the template.\r\n\r\nWhen I now open the same Ng project in Electron 12.x which runs Chromium 89.0.4389.69, a lot of the JS functionality does not work anymore and it turns out that changeDetection is needed in many places to propagate the changes from the component to the template...\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my Karma/Jasmine unit tests which include shallow integration tests (that interact w/ the GUI) all work flawlessly (no errors reported and interaction w/ html elements works), yet since the Ng build now does not work as expected in Electron's Chromium, I guess this renders some of these shallow integration tests completely useless as some of these html elements do not exist in Ng running in Electron (unless I add CD everywhere)... yet Karma/Jasmine reports no errors...

This creates problems for test environments and any instrumentation that relies on task counts.\r\n\r\n(It is somewhat similar to issue #38795.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n```javascript\r\nZone.root\r\n  .fork({\r\n    name: 'xhr',\r\n    onHasTask(delegate, currentZone, zone, taskState) {\r\n      console.log('hasMacrotask', taskState.macroTask);\r\n      return delegate.hasTask(zone, taskState);\r\n    },      \r\n  })\r\n  .run(() => {\r\n    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n    xhr.open('GET', 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/zone.js/0.11.4/zone.min.js');\r\n    xhr.addEventListener('load', () => {\r\n      throw new Error();\r\n    });\r\n    xhr.send();\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code ends by printing `hasMacrotask true` and the XHR task left in a `scheduled` state.\r\n\r\nNote that this repro specifically forks the root zone. If you try to repro this in StackBlitz or in Angular's `NgZone` and for the current zone instead, you'll need to wrap the `addEventListener()` call in `Zone.root.run()` to make it work. The reason is that `NgZone` implements a `onHandleError()` delegate hook that always returns false, and the exception get swallowed instead of being thrown.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41520","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[zonejs] XMLHttpRequest macrotask left hanging if `onload` throws\" (#41520)"},{"Id":"852923173","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T20:43:53","Actor":"TeriGlover","Number":"41499","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X]  Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[cleanupCaches()](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3a823abcc554cffdda1e14e181dadad9063701de/packages/service-worker/worker/src/driver.ts#L890) function from the service-worker implementation

function:\r\n\r\n> This may skip some clients in the browser back-forward cache, but not much can be done about that.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI thought, that we could use a reasonable TTL to make the cache eviction a little bit safer. Namely:\r\n\r\n1. we assign a `last access time` property to each version of the application and update it each time when the specific version is used by the client.\r\n2. we configure a reasonable TTL value, e.g. 24 hours\r\n3. during the cache cleanup we add an additional step to determine if the version could be safely evicted from the cache by comparing `last access time` for this version with the TTL.\r\n\r\nIn other words: the application could be removed from the cache when the assigned client ID is no longer present and after the specific time has passed since the last use of this version.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that even if a browser has cached some version of the application in it's back-forward cache it can still be used (during the specified TTL period).\r\n\r\nI'm willing to implement this feature if it will be considered useful.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nDon't know about any alternative solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"proposal: use TTL and last access time to evict unused versions from service-worker's cache\" (#41508)"},{"Id":"853345026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T10:57:39","Actor":"protyliss","Number":"41507","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cant' Serving with NG6002 error","State":"open","Body":"I made a clone workspace, and got a below errors :\r\nOriginal workspace working fine anyway.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: node_modules/@angular/platform-browser/platform-browser.d.ts:44:22 - error NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\r\n\r\nThis likely means that the library (@angular/platform-browser) which declares BrowserModule has not been processed correctly by ngcc, or is not compatible with Angular Ivy.

Webpack 4 usage and support has been removed.\r\nNo project level configuration changes are required to take advantage of the upgraded Webpack version when using the official Angular builders.\r\nCustom builders based on this package that use the experimental programmatic APIs may need to be updated to become compatible with Webpack 5.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Webpack 5 lazy loaded file name changes\r\nWebpack 5 generates similar but differently named files for lazy loaded JavaScript files in development configurations (when the `namedChunks` option is enabled).\r\nFor the majority of users this change should have no effect on the application and/or build process. Production builds should also not be affected as the `namedChunks` option is disabled by default in production configurations.\r\nHowever, if a project's post-build process makes assumptions as to the file names then adjustments may need to be made to account for the new naming paradigm.\r\nSuch post-build processes could include custom file transformations after the build, integration into service-side frameworks, or deployment procedures.\r\nExample development file name change: `lazy-lazy-module.js` --> `src_app_lazy_lazy_module_ts.js`\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Webpack 5 web worker support\r\nWebpack 5 now includes web worker support. However, the structure of the URL within the `Worker` constructor must be in a specific format that differs from the current requirement.\r\nWeb worker usage should be updated as shown below (where `./app.worker` should be replaced with the actual worker name):\r\nBefore: `new Worker('./app.worker', ...)`\r\nAfter:  `new Worker(new URL('./app.worker', import.meta.url), ...)`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Upgrade tooling to use Webpack 5\" (#20466)"},{"Id":"853447055","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T12:58:54","Actor":"andreyan-andreev","Number":"20476","RawContent":null,"Title":"tsconfig IDE support for multi project workspace","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [X] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nsee above. \r\n\r\nThe problem I encountered is that I was not able to use `paths` configuration in tsconfig, the compiler works but the ide cries. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd `tsconfig.json` file at the application directory\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"./tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"] I have to add because new files were not picked up by tsserver, something about \"the file is not part of tsconfig project\" etc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tsconfig IDE support for multi project workspace\" (#20476)"},{"Id":"853157783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T12:35:26","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"20468","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update typescript to version 4.2.4","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | [`4.2.3` -> `4.2.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/4.2.3/4.2.4) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/compatibility-slim/4.2.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/confidence-slim/4.2.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is great because it allows for situations where multiple versions of a collection are in use, or for collections that require peer dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour is currently not present in architect builders. Those are only resolved in the folder the angular.json file is in, making certain situations impossible.\r\n\r\nA very specific case: I've got a repository that contains tooling, and I'm using typescript 4.2 for this repo. I'm using the angular CLI to configure the projects in the repo, with a homebrew architect builder to create npm packages to run in node.\r\nNow I want to add an angular application to the repo to test packages in the repo, as the tool in question is `@ngx-playwright/jest`, meant for using Jest and Playwright to run e2e tests.\r\nHowever, building the angular app only works if I install `@angular-devkit/build-angular` in the root package.json file, which requires `@angular/compiler-cli`, `@angular/compiler`, `@angular/core`, `rxjs` and `zone.js` as well. It also requires `typscript@>= 4.0 < 4.2` which clashes with the 4.2.3 that I'm using throughout the repo.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm using a package manager that doesn't hoist dependencies (i.e. the behaviour of yarn 2's pnp¬†linker or pnpm)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to install `@angular-devkit/build-angular` in the test application's folder instead of the repo root. This package.json already contains all necessary peer dependencies and it can use 4.1 without me having to downgrade typescript throughout the entire repo.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- Use a package manager that hoists dependencies. This allows for installing the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` package in the test app's folder while it'll still end up in the root `node_modules` so the angular CLI can find it. It will still find the wrong version of typescript though, so I'm still stuck.\r\n- Downgrade my repo to typescript 4.1: this might be possible, but it feels very wrong that the one angular app in the repo should define the typescript version being used to build the node packages throughout the entire repo as well as the typescript language server version used by VS Code.\r\n- Create a separate `angular.json` in the test app's folder. This is the solution I'm going for, but if I have multiple `angular.json` files I'm losing a lot of the ergonomics the angular CLI normally offers.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support resolving architect builders relative to project\" (#20453)"},{"Id":"851271544","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T10:57:22","Actor":"Enivile","Number":"20452","RawContent":null,"Title":"ENOENT on ng serve","State":"closed","Body":"I am using VS Code I encountered the same error once before searched for it but didn't find any solution so I uninstalled the VS code and reinstalled.

It's not ideal to have component-specific DOM structure leaking into the global focus indicators stylesheet. We've had a number of bugs come up where tweaking a component's DOM structure has led to focus indicators breaking when we forget to update the stylesheet. Thus, this PR removes the component-specific focus indicator rendering conditions from the global stylesheet, and instead, moves this logic into the components that need it.\r\n2. If a developer wants to add Material focus indicators to a new custom component, they can manually add the `.mat-focus-indicator` class to the appropriate element. However, currently we expect this element to be the actual element that receives focus. We provide no mechanism for a developer to add a focus indicator to an element that doesn't actually receive focus, but should render a focus indicator when some associated element receives focus (e.g. see `mat-checkbox`). This PR introduces a new public CSS class `.mat-focus-indicator-render` that developers can use to \"manually\" render a focus indicator in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe downside to this change is that a handful of components now have `focus` and `blur` event listeners bound to them, in order to update the `.mat-focus-indicator-render` class properly. We could avoid these event listeners by instead updating these components to check something like `inputElement === document.activeElement`, but I wasn't sure which to prefer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22414","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk/a11y): Move component-specific focus indicator rendering to each component\" (#22414)"},{"Id":"851726676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T19:00:42","Actor":"bq007","Number":"22413","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Mat Table] Voiceover is not announcing mat-table column count correctly in forward navigation.","State":"open","Body":"#### Description\r\n\r\nWhen forward navigating to Mat Table, the VoiceOver screen speaker announces table columns as 0. \r\n![Screen Shot for mat table bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67595364/113763890-39216100-96e8-11eb-96cc-91a9788843f0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nUse Angular Material demos for mat table to reproduce the issue: \r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-dynamic-columns\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

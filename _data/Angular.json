However, it currently lacks support for object destructuring, which limits its expressiveness and readability when dealing with structured data returned from signals or computed values.\n\nFor example, given a signal:\n\n```ts\nreadonly stateSignal = signal({ keyA: 'foo', keyB: 'bar' });\n```\n\nYou must currently access the properties manually:\n\n```html\n@let state = stateSignal();\n\n<div>{{ state.keyA }}</div>\n<div>{{ state.keyB }}</div>\n```\n\nThis works but becomes verbose and less declarative. Support for destructuring would allow for a more concise and intuitive syntax:\n\n```html\n@let { keyA, keyB } = stateSignal();\n\n<div>{{ keyA }}</div>\n<div>{{ keyB }}</div>\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend the @let directive parsing to support object destructuring using JavaScript/TypeScript syntax:\n- Allow { ... } object pattern matching\n- Optionally allow renaming with keyA: aliasA\n- Support destructuring for both plain signals and computed values\n\nThis would align template syntax more closely with TypeScript and reduce verbosity.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n-

However, each assistant expects these files in different locations and formats (e.g., .github/COPILOT_GUIDE.md for Copilot, .cursor/rules.md for Cursor).\n\nCurrently, adding these files is a manual process and can be inconsistent across teams and projects.\n\nFeature Request:\nAdd a schematic or CLI command that allows users to generate an AI prompt guide markdown file in the correct location and format for their chosen assistant. For example:\n\nCode\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant copilot      # Generates .github/COPILOT_GUIDE.md\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant cursor       # Generates .cursor/rules.md\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant generic      # Generates PROMPT_GUIDE.md in project root\n\nThis would:\nHelp teams adopt AI assistant best practices quickly.\nEnsure prompt guides are in the

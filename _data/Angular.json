all components use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`\n\nThis requires importing `ChangeDetectionStrategy` from `@angular/core`, and adding the line `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in  component declarations.\n\nThis process is repeated in every component in the application.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow a configuration to set the default change detection strategy, for example by introducing a `withChangeDetectionStrategy(strategy)` function for the configuration.\n\nThis would remove a lot of boilerplate code in every component.\n\nWe can configure CLI to add this line when creating new components, but some of us do not use the CLI to generate components, and it would still generate boilerplate code, making component code more cluttered.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nApologies if this is already possible, for example by setting the ChangeDetectionStrategy in the `Root` component.

Implementing a cross-language schema is more difficult, plus JavaScript/TypeScript is what most people are using (I don't know if other language support even exists).\n\nAngular is the only remaining major framework to not have the ability for a specific TypeScript interface to be augmented:\n\n- **Solid.js**: augment `solid-js` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Vue**: augment `vue` module's `GlobalComponents`\n- **Svelte**: augment the global `svelteHTML.IntrinsicElements` or augment `svelte/elements` module's `SvelteHTMLElements`\n- **React**: augment `react` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Preact**: augment `preact` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements` with the same definition as for react with react compat enabled\n- **Angular**: n/a\n\nThe usage could look this,\n\n```ts\n// `angular` module\n\nexport type GlobalCSSValues = 'inherit' | 'initial' | 'etc'\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface CSSProperties {\n\tvisibility: 'hidden' | 'visible' | 'collapse' | GlobalCSSValues\n\tdisplay: 'none' | 'block' | 'inline' | 'etc' | GlobalCSSValues\n\t// ... etc ...\n}\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface IntrinsicElements {\n  div: { /* ... */ }\n  button: : { /* ... */ }\n  // ... etc ...\n}\n```\n```ts\n// user code\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n    // plus generic types for Angular's special bindings can be provided out of the box (insead of the user writing them here):\n    & type Obj = {\n\t// [class.foo]= bindings\n\t[K in `class.${string}`]?: boolean\n    } & {\n\t// [style.known]= bindings\n\t[K in keyof CSSProperties as `style.${keyof CSSProperties}`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n    } & {\n\t// [style.unknown]= bindings\n\t[K in `style.${string}`]?: string\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nor similar.\n\nHere's an example of the special `style.` and `class.` binding types in TypeScript playground:\n\n[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/C4TwDgpgBA4gNgewEYEM4GEDKmBqaCuEAzlALxQDkAlgHYAWEATlcBVAD6W0tVpucUIwAMYUAUGID0kqCnwBzALYQawFEjjRawJgDMUwiGO16D0LJgAKjBJEbAqxKAG8xASABuVIlSRU4LCAAXJR0VAAm4Sr8lF4+GhAxFMIIcHAoYESJHLCIqBjYeHCERO7h3mDpwZQ0CDTZAhoIwgDWSbQB9UlCojnwyGgWRSXu0lAAdJNQPROTYgC+EqCQUADySABWZC6jMgDawulEROO6CAgAuuR+NOU08qVuewDSULRQAAaHKMfjACTOIjAZj3eYfC4AfhCSHOmhQNAWUAAZDsoFAxnsgSBNKdzlcoDc7g8xGiXm8aFAWhAQAhdFALNZbEwHE4fp8sTiAVSaXSGTY7CyiGDISE+Uz7I4iC8LgsJCkaECoAgAIwhdZbciuNxnBAhZUAJgAzAAadEyJg2RhQAAU8nO4QAlLKxPLFQh9WrNtstckjicdRQ9UbTWMLQgrbb7U7Fi66m7DZ6NTs3L6fv7zoGoMDCCGZAgWs7XcAlQAWRPe9yp34BkL6OBZXNKgsxotKgCs5c1lY5EFxCEzFA0KDoFEbYYjdoQjsLceLCAAbJ3kxQe+NykRKigQAOhyOx4xLTbJ9OW7OlQB2Jc+1frzfbkKDxCtUdmpsLIA)\n\n\nThe generic `style.` and `class.` stuff can be provided as a default with a helper from `angular`, for example:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nHeck, you could even require the syntax to match, for sake of consistency with template syntax, and it is possible thanks to TypeScript template string types:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      '[attr.foo]'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      '(some-event)'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n```ts\n// and similar for the builtin props:\nexport type IntrinsicBindings = {\n  // [class.foo]= bindings\n  [K in `[class.${string}]`]?: boolean\n} & {\n  // [style.known]= bindings\n  [K in keyof CSSProperties as `[style.${keyof CSSProperties}]`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n} & {\n  // [style.unknown]= bindings\n  [K in `[style.${string}]`]?: string\n}\n```\n\nLibrary authors making custom element libraries can then make their own mapped-type helpers to map their element class properties, for example, to property, attribute, and event types, and they can even expand the `class.` and `style.` types if needed.\n\nFor example, given a class like this:\n\n```js\nimport {attribute, element, event} from 'some-lib' // For example, https://github.com/lume/element\n\nexport\n@element('my-element')\nclass MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n  @attribute foo: \"foo\" | \"bar\" = \"foo\" // the initial value when no foo attribute is set (or foo attribute is removed)\n\n  @event 'onsome-event': ((event: SomeEvent) => void) | null = null\n\n  // ... implementation omitted ...\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nthen a custom element author can define their own mapped type (as they already will be doing for React, Preact, Solid, Vue, Svelte, and others) to make it easy to define element types for their specific custom element library:\n\n```ts\nimport type {ElementAttributesForAngular} from 'some-lib/vue-types'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    // pick the properties to be used for Angular template types (any not listed are omitted from template type checking)\n    'my-element': ElementAttributesForAngular<MyEl, 'foo' | 'onsome-event'>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nImplement a schema, and the tooling needed to map that to TypeScript (and other language) definitions like in #12045? Good luck! I imagine that's why #12045 has been open for 8 years since 2016.\n\nA TypeScript interface would much easier to provide because TypeScript is the current foundation, and it would be immediately usable by a large amount of web developers. \n\nPeople can also use TypeScript definitions as a source for mapping to other languages, so even having just TypeScript support would be a better starting point than a more difficult schema idea.\n\nThere are already tools like [TypeScript-to-Flow](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-flow) converters, so starting with a TypeScript interface right now, would be valuable a lot more quickly than #12045.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[language-server] TypeScript interface for element definitions (including for custom elements)\" (#58483)"},{"Id":"2630872997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T23:58:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"58482","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): correctly add external stylesheets to ShadowDOM components","State":"open","Body":"Angular components that use ShadowDOM view encapsulation have an alternate execution path for adding component styles to the DOM that does not use the SharedStylesHost that all other view encapsulation modes leverage.

Expected behavior would be `en-US/speakers/xyz/index.html`.\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0-rc.0\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0-rc.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0-rc.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0-rc.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0-rc.0 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0-rc.0\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0-rc.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nIn Angular v18 the issue is not reproducible.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28775","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Wrong path to prerendered html page with baseHref set\" (#28775)"},{"Id":"2630004557","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T19:57:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28771","RawContent":null,"Title":"Windows CI fixes","State":"closed","Body":"A fix for Windows CI as well as improvements to prevent flakes.\r\nThe Windows E2E build and rebuild tests are also now added to PRs to reduce main CI failure occurrences.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28771","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Windows CI fixes\" (#28771)"},{"Id":"2629629858","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T12:26:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28770","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): allow in-memory caching of server main code bundling during rebuilds","State":"closed","Body":"In addition to the other main code bundling steps, the server main code will\r\nalso be cached and invalidated based on file changes in watch mode.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28770","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): allow in-memory caching of server main code bundling during rebuilds\" (#28770)"},{"Id":"2630365876","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T10:12:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28774","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): split SSR server assets into separate chunks","State":"open","Body":"This commit refactors the build process for server-side rendering (SSR) by dividing server assets into separate, importable chunks rather than bundling them into a single output file\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28774","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/build): split SSR server assets into separate chunks\" (#28774)"},{"Id":"2630221636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T05:10:57","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28773","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency sass to v1.80.6","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [sass](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass) | dependencies | patch | [`1.80.5` -> `1.80.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/sass/1.80.5/1.80.6) |\n| [sass](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass) | devDependencies | patch | [`1.80.5` -> `1.80.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/sass/1.80.5/1.80.6) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.80.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1806)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.80.5...1.80.6)\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Make `@parcel/watcher` an optional dependency so this can still be installed\n    on operating systems where it's unavailable.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

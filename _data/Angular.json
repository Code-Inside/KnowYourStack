Tailwind dark mode directives won't work correctly in component styles with view encapsulation other than `none`, as tailwind will just try to prepend class with `.dark`, so the result code will be something like `.dark[_ng-content-**] .value[_ng-content-**]`. Also not sure what will happen with `ShadowDom`, tested only with `emulated`. In `ngneat/tailwind` we made PostCSS plugin for it: https://github.com/vltansky/postcss-ng-tailwind-in-components.

This could also be made possible by exposing the current `private _keyManager` property either by making it protected or providing a public getter/method so that the consumer of the CdkStepper can manage that on their own.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nIn our case we want to be able to switch between vertical and horizontal orientation on a single component via an Input. Switching orientation should have some effects, most importantly that keyboard controls should be different (UP and DOWN arrows for vertical orientation).\r\nIn the current implementation and how it is implemented in material that is done by two separate components that explicitly set the `_orientation` property and setting the keymanager up in the `ngAfterViewInit` hook.\r\n\r\nPseudo Code what we'd like to do:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class MyStepper extends CdkStepper {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set direction(value) {\r\n    this._direction = value;\r\n    this._keyManager.withVerticalOrientation(this._direction === 'vertical');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I think just changing the orientation in the keyManager should be enough, even nicer would be that the CdkStepper would already support setting the `_orientation` property dynamically, but I'd understand if you don't want to support that inside the CdkStepper. In this case exposing the keyManager would give us as the consumer the possibility at our own risk to implement this feature and not being forced into doing two separate components.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I am happy to open a PR if you want to support that use case.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21874","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdk-stepper): change orientation on runtime or expose key manager property\" (#21874)"},{"Id":"806084742","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-11T05:14:05","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"21873","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bump firebase-tools from 9.2.2 to 9.3.0","State":"open","Body":"Bumps [firebase-tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) from 9.2.2 to 9.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases\">firebase-tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v9.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds support for batchDelete in Auth Emulator (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/3091\">#3091</a>).</li>\n<li>Adds support for createSessionCookie in Auth Emulator (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/3094\">#3094</a>).</li>\n<li>Fixes support for using the CLI as a library against locally running emulators (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/3084\">#3084</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/commit/3c0d4ed89d82117a6081be3b355438a49c01c795\"><code>3c0d4ed</code></a> 9.3.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/commit/93ea96180108de85b8118464bfeff2fdd32cd47f\"><code>93ea961</code></a> fixes support for calls against local emulators as admin (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/3099\">#3099</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/commit/76726d760ce986c64c5fba30737afea9ea458057\"><code>76726d7</code></a> Implement session cookies in Auth Emulator.

Go to the \"Creating groups of options\" demo on the [mat-select demo page](https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview#creating-groups-of-options).\r\n2. Navigate through the mat-select with groups using a screen-reader's page navigation. \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe group label should only be read once when the screen-reader navigates through the select options. The group label itself should never get focus, but its value should be read when the user navigates into the group.  \r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nChromeVox (issue): The screen-reader will read focus the group label and read the group name twice (\"Grass\" followed by \"Grass group\")\r\n\r\nMacOS VoiceOver + Chrome (issue): The screen-reader focuses the group as a whole and reads the group name (\"Grass, group 2 of 5\"). Then it progresses to the group label (\"Grass\") before going into the options.\r\n\r\nWindows JAWS + Chrome (ok): The screen-reader skips the label element and reads the group label when navigating into a group of options.\r\n\r\n#### Guidance\r\n\r\nmat-select is a listbox widget, and per the [WAI ARIA listbox guidance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#listbox), listboxes should \"contain children whose role is option or elements whose role is group which in turn contains children whose role is option.\" The `<label>` elements interfere with this pattern because they are not hidden from the a11y tree. \r\n\r\nWe can fix this by adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to the `<label>` element, so that while screenreaders will still announce the label text for the group (due to the aria-labelledby property on mat-optgroup), they will skip over the actual label element. Optionally, the `<label>` could be changed to a `<span>` to make it clear that the text is visual only and not carrying any special semantic meaning for the a11y tree. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21857","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-optgroup): <label> element should be skipped during screen-reader page navigation\" (#21857)"},{"Id":"804889859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-09T20:20:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21856","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): avoid interfering with external click listener","State":"open","Body":"Currently the datepicker toggle's `click` listener is on the inner `button` element and we call `stopPropagation` on it in order to prevent the form field from focusing the input.

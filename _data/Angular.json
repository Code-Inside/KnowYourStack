This means that everytime you release a new version of your application, the new version's resources will be cached for offline use (the expected behavior). However, all of the cached content (scripts, css, HTML, etc) from the previous versions of the application are still stored in cache. This means that the application's cache will grow exponentially with every release of your application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Setup new CLI project ng new my-pwa-app\r\n1. Add PWA support ng add @angular/pwa --project my-pwa-app\r\n1. Build production version of application and run locally (observe cache size)\r\n1. Make small (non-functional) change to the application (just to change file hashing) - representing a new version of your application being deployed.\r\n1. Build production version of the application and run locally again (NOTE: the cache size will be double what it was before). Repeat steps 4 and 5 and this behavior will continue (cache size will continue to grow, because it is holding onto the previous version's cached files).\r\n\r\n**Application cache storage (same content, different version):**\r\nVersion 1: 12.2 MB\r\nVersion 2: 23.5 MB\r\nVersion 3: 32.9 MB\r\n...etc.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 11\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1774477/115428812-ca0c3800-a1d0-11eb-9636-7d53636e0e12.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41728","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular/pwa doesn't clean up previous service worker version's cached content\" (#41728)"},{"Id":"863018955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T16:53:20","Actor":"aahmedayed","Number":"41730","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(common): synchronise location mock behavior with the navigators","State":"open","Body":"do not emit event for imperative navigation.\r\nemit a `popstate` event before each `hashchange` to have the same\r\nbehavior of the `history API`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nAfter this change we should not use location.go to test an imperative navigation, we\r\nhave to use route.navigate or route.navigateByUrl methods.\r\n`popstate` will be emitted before each `hashchange` event.

It replaces the 5+ year old internals with a new low-level parser: [`micromark`][micromark]. The old internals have served billions of users well over the years, but markdown has changed over that time. micromark comes with 100% CommonMark (and GFM as an extension) compliance, and (WIP) docs on parsing rules for how to tokenize markdown with a [state machine][cmsm]. micromark, and micromark in remark, is a good base for the future.\n\n#### Migration\n\n-   Update all the `remark*` packages you are using in `package.json`\n-   Did you use GFM (tables and so, used to be the default)? Now add [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   Try running it all. If it fails, you are probably using a [syntax extension which hasn‚Äôt been updated yet][plugins], there are issues open on the issue trackers of those plugins already\n-   Compare the previous output to the new output: anything wrong? See below for the changelog which might cover it. Otherwise, It‚Äôs probably because remark is now CommonMark (or GFM) compliant.\n    Please compare with those projects if the new behavior is correct or not ([CommonMark Dingus](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/), or [create a gist](http://gist.github.com/new) for GFM).\n    Does remark not match those reference parsers? Please open an issue here!\n\n#### Changes\n\n##### remark-parse\n\n`remark-parse` now defers its work to [`micromark`][micromark] and [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown]. `micromark` is a new, small, complete, and CommonMark compliant low-level markdown parser. `from-markdown` turns its tokens into the previously (and still) used syntax tree: [mdast][]. Extensions to `remark-parse` work differently: they‚Äôre a two-part act. See for example [`micromark-extension-footnote`][micromark-footnote] and [`mdast-util-footnote`][from-markdown-footnote].\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option ‚Äî it‚Äôs the default\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `blocks` is no longer an options ‚Äî it‚Äôs no longer suggested to change the internal list of HTML ‚Äúblock‚Äù tag names\n\n##### remark-stringify\n\nremark-stringify now defers its work to [`mdast-util-to-markdown`][to-markdown]. It‚Äôs a new and better serializer with powerful features to ensure serialized markdown represents the syntax tree (mdast), no matter what plugins do. Extensions to it work differently: see for example [`mdast-util-footnote`][to-markdown-footnote].\n\n###### `options`\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option, it‚Äôs the default\n-   change: `emphasis` now defaults to `*`\n-   change: `bullet` now defaults to `*`\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tableCellPadding` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tablePipeAlign` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `stringLength` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `entities` is no longer an option ‚Äî with CommonMark there is almost never a need to use character references, as character escapes are preferred\n-   new: `quote` ‚Äî you can now prefer single quotes (`'`) over double quotes (`\"`) in titles\n\n##### Changes to output / the tree\n\nAll of these are for CommonMark compatibility. They‚Äôre all fixes. Most of them are inconsequential to most folks.\n\n-   **notable**: references (as in, links `[text][id]` and images `![alt][id]`) are no longer present as such in the syntax tree if they don‚Äôt have a corresponding definition (`[id]: example.com`). The reason for this is that CommonMark requires `[text *emphasis\n    start][undefined] emphasis end*` to be emphasis.\n-   **notable**: it is no longer possible to use two blank lines between two lists or a list and indented code. CommonMark prohibits it. For a solution, use an empty comment to end lists (`<!---->`)\n-   inconsequential: whitespace at the start and end of lines in paragraphs is now ignored\n-   inconsequential: `<mailto:foobarbaz>` are now correctly parsed, and the scheme is part of the tree\n-   inconsequential: indented code can now follow a block quote w/o blank line\n-   inconsequential: trailing indented blank lines after indented code are no longer part of that code\n-   inconsequential: character references and escapes are no longer present as separate text nodes\n-   inconsequential: character references which HTML allows but CommonMark doesn‚Äôt, such as `&copy` w/o the semicolon, are no longer recognized\n-   inconsequential: the `indent` field is no longer available on `position`\n-   fix: multiline setext headings\n-   fix: lazy lists\n-   fix: attention (emphasis, strong)\n-   fix: tabs\n-   fix: empty alt on images is now present as an empty string\n-   ‚Ä¶plus a ton of other minor previous differences from CommonMark\n\n##### Thanks\n\nThanks to [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and

For this i am following recommended process i.e. updating application to one bigger version step by step, so till now i was able to update application from version 7 to 8(where application compiles and runs successfully) and followed by version 8 to 9. Since i moved from View Engine to Ivy as rendering engine i am getting template errors for all the templates from application, from which i have attached some of them in a text file below for the reference. I tried running application by disabling Ivy from tsconfig.json file and its running without any problem, but as soon as i enable Ivy it gives template errors all over the application. \r\n**I updated package.json file for \"postinstall\": \"ngcc\" and executed npm install by removing node_modules files**. \r\n\r\nSeems like templates are not able to identify the angular tags though i have imported all the required modules into respective modules.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n382                         <mat-menu #menu=\"matMenu\">\r\n

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>remarkjs/remark</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.0`](https://togithub.com/remarkjs/remark/releases/13.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/remarkjs/remark/compare/12.0.1...13.0.0)\n\nThis is a giant change for remark. It replaces the 5+ year old internals with a new low-level parser: [`micromark`][micromark]. The old internals have served billions of users well over the years, but markdown has changed over that time. micromark comes with 100% CommonMark (and GFM as an extension) compliance, and (WIP) docs on parsing rules for how to tokenize markdown with a [state machine][cmsm]. micromark, and micromark in remark, is a good base for the future.\n\n#### Migration\n\n-   Update all the `remark*` packages you are using in `package.json`\n-   Did you use GFM (tables and so, used to be the default)? Now add [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   Try running it all. If it fails, you are probably using a [syntax extension which hasn‚Äôt been updated yet][plugins], there are issues open on the issue trackers of those plugins already\n-   Compare the previous output to the new output: anything wrong? See below for the changelog which might cover it. Otherwise, It‚Äôs probably because remark is now CommonMark (or GFM) compliant.\n    Please compare with those projects if the new behavior is correct or not ([CommonMark Dingus](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/), or [create a gist](http://gist.github.com/new) for GFM).\n    Does remark not match those reference parsers? Please open an issue here!\n\n#### Changes\n\n##### remark-parse\n\n`remark-parse` now defers its work to [`micromark`][micromark] and [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown]. `micromark` is a new, small, complete, and CommonMark compliant low-level markdown parser. `from-markdown` turns its tokens into the previously (and still) used syntax tree: [mdast][]. Extensions to `remark-parse` work differently: they‚Äôre a two-part act. See for example [`micromark-extension-footnote`][micromark-footnote] and [`mdast-util-footnote`][from-markdown-footnote].\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option ‚Äî it‚Äôs the default\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `blocks` is no longer an options ‚Äî it‚Äôs no longer suggested to change the internal list of HTML ‚Äúblock‚Äù tag names\n\n##### remark-stringify\n\nremark-stringify now defers its work to [`mdast-util-to-markdown`][to-markdown]. It‚Äôs a new and better serializer with powerful features to ensure serialized markdown represents the syntax tree (mdast), no matter what plugins do. Extensions to it work differently: see for example [`mdast-util-footnote`][to-markdown-footnote].\n\n###### `options`\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option, it‚Äôs the default\n-   change: `emphasis` now defaults to `*`\n-   change: `bullet` now defaults to `*`\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tableCellPadding` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tablePipeAlign` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `stringLength` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `entities` is no longer an option ‚Äî with CommonMark there is almost never a need to use character references, as character escapes are preferred\n-   new: `quote` ‚Äî you can now prefer single quotes (`'`) over double quotes (`\"`) in titles\n\n##### Changes to output / the tree\n\nAll of these are for CommonMark compatibility. They‚Äôre all fixes. Most of them are inconsequential to most folks.\n\n-   **notable**: references (as in, links `[text][id]` and images `![alt][id]`) are no longer present as such in the syntax tree if they don‚Äôt have a corresponding definition (`[id]: example.com`). The reason for this is that CommonMark requires `[text *emphasis\n    start][undefined] emphasis end*` to be emphasis.\n-   **notable**: it is no longer possible to use two blank lines between two lists or a list and indented code. CommonMark prohibits it. For a solution, use an empty comment to end lists (`<!---->`)\n-   inconsequential: whitespace at the start and end of lines in paragraphs is now ignored\n-   inconsequential: `<mailto:foobarbaz>` are now correctly parsed, and the scheme is part of the tree\n-   inconsequential: indented code can now follow a block quote w/o blank line\n-   inconsequential: trailing indented blank lines after indented code are no longer part of that code\n-   inconsequential: character references and escapes are no longer present as separate text nodes\n-   inconsequential: character references which HTML allows but CommonMark doesn‚Äôt, such as `&copy` w/o the semicolon, are no longer recognized\n-   inconsequential: the `indent` field is no longer available on `position`\n-   fix: multiline setext headings\n-   fix: lazy lists\n-   fix: attention (emphasis, strong)\n-   fix: tabs\n-   fix: empty alt on images is now present as an empty string\n-   ‚Ä¶plus a ton of other minor previous differences from CommonMark\n\n##### Thanks\n\nThanks to [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and

But for some reason my code is working different on chrome and Firefox.\r\n\r\nI have this code:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<theme-generator-previewer [defaultColorProvider]=\"myFunction\" />\r\n```\r\n``` typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'theme-generator-editor',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, ThemeGeneratorPreviewer],\r\n  templateUrl: './theme-generator-editor.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./theme-generator-editor.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class ThemeGeneratorEditorComponent {\r\n  colors = undefined;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.colors = { ... }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  myFunction(key) {\r\n    return this.colors[key];\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n      \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nand then, on the child component template I do something like this:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n  <div *ngFor=\"let colors of colorKeys\">\r\n        <input [value]=\"defaultColorProvider(key)\" > \r\n  </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works if I **DO NOT** use the `this` keyword in the funciton that I'm passing as Input to the child component. Lets say, if I do something like:\r\n``` typescript\r\nmyFunction(key){\r\n  return '#00ff00'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy values will be green. But if I use the `this` keyword, on Chrome the values gets correctly binded, but in Firefox this wont work.\r\n\r\nI also tried doing something like:\r\n```\r\n<theme-generator-previewer [defaultColorProvider]=\"myFunction.bind(this)\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this will work on Chrome and not in Firefox.\r\nI also tried making an arrow function, but in that case my code will work on Firefox and not in Chrome. I'm a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nIf you console.log `this.colors` in `myFunction` you will see `undefined` on Firefox, but the real variable on Chrome.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is not a bug on your side, but any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 15.2.9\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.9 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.9 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.9\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThis is easily reproducible with Chrome and Firefox.

Aside from the diagnostic, I have to move some code around so it can be reused.

We already have the utility, but these changes simplify the public API and expose it so it can be used in `compiler-cli`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): expose ng-content selectors and preserveWhitespaces during template type checking\r\nThese changes expose the `ngContentSelectors` and `preserveWhitespaces` metadata to the TCB so they can be used in the next commit to implement a new diagnostic.\r\n\r\n### test(core): add tests for control flow content projection with ng-container\r\nThe control flow projection diagnostic will mention `ng-container` as a workaround for projection multiple nodes.

This should be more familiar for people coming from other similar tools, as well as make better use of large screens.\n\n-   Allow decorators after the `export` keyword ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    Previously esbuild's decorator parser followed the original behavior of TypeScript's experimental decorators feature, which only allowed decorators to come before the `export` keyword. However, the upcoming JavaScript decorators feature also allows decorators to come after the `export` keyword. And with TypeScript 5.0, TypeScript now also allows experimental decorators to come after the `export` keyword too. So esbuild now allows this as well:\n\n    ```js\n    // This old syntax has always been permitted:\n    @&#8203;decorator export class Foo {}\n    @&#8203;decorator export default class Foo {}\n\n    // This new syntax is now permitted too:\n    export @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    export default @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n    In addition, esbuild's decorator parser has been rewritten to fix several subtle and likely unimportant edge cases with esbuild's parsing of exports and decorators in TypeScript (e.g. TypeScript apparently does automatic semicolon insertion after `interface` and `export interface` but not after `export default interface`).\n\n-   Pretty-print decorators using the same whitespace as the original\n\n    When printing code containing decorators, esbuild will now try to respect whether the original code contained newlines after the decorator or not. This can make generated code containing many decorators much more compact to read:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a @&#8203;b @&#8203;c abc\n      @&#8203;x @&#8203;y @&#8203;z xyz\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a\n      @&#8203;b\n      @&#8203;c\n      abc;\n      @&#8203;x\n      @&#8203;y\n      @&#8203;z\n      xyz;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a @&#8203;b @&#8203;c abc;\n      @&#8203;x @&#8203;y @&#8203;z xyz;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.6.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#460)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.5.2...v4.6.0)\n\n*2023-11-26*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Allow `this.addWatchFile` in all plugin hooks ([#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5270))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Show helpful error when native binaries are not installed due to an `npm` issue ([#&#8203;5267](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5267))\n-   Do not access `this` context in `this.addWatchFile` so it does not need to be bound when passed around ([#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5270))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5267](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5267): Add friendly error for npm bug ([@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red))\n-   [#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5270): Allow this.addWatchFile in all hooks ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5272](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5272): Debug deployed graphs ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.28.1`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.28.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v5.28.0...v5.28.1)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   perf: Improve `normalizeMethod` by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2456](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2456)\n-   fix: dispatch error handling by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2459](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2459)\n-   perf(request): optimize if headers are given by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2454](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2454)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v5.28.0...v5.28.1\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Previously we couldn't do it because we didn't want to introduce a dependency to `@angular/cdk`.\r\n\r\n### feat(youtube-player): automatically load youtube api\r\nCurrently users have to load the YouTube API themselves which can be tricky to get right and be prone to race conditions. Since there's only one way to load it, these changes switch to doing so automatically. Loading the API automatically also enables us to optimize the component further in a follow-up PR by showing a placeholder image.\r\n\r\nIf users don't want the API to be loaded automatically, they can disable it through an input or using the newly-introduced `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_CONFIG` injection token.\r\n\r\nFixes #17037.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** there was an earlier attempt at this feature in #21401 which didn't land due to some concerns around API loading.

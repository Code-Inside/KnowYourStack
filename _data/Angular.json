However, `getSourceFile` will return `undefined` if the requested file does not exist.

Conforms with [WAI ARIA Listbox authoring practices guide]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/), which says to always include aria-selected attribute on options that are selectable. Fix issue where voiceover reads every option as \"selected\" (#25736).\r\n\r\nFix #25736","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25748","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/chips): don't remove aria-selected from deselected options\" (#25748)"},{"Id":"1394922495","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-03T15:24:33","Actor":"cotneit","Number":"25747","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): changes appearance with box-sizing: border-box","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nA lot of apps (notably the ones using Tailwind) use `* {box-sizing: border-box; }` to default `box-sizing` to `border-box`.\r\nThis causes top outline on focused `mat-form-field` with `appearance=\"outline\"` to change appearance around the label when it's floating. It doesn't change much but enough to feel that something's off because the upper-left bit becomes shorter.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36513243/193611594-aeedc640-b82d-47fb-925d-b8306f10a8f5.png)\r\n\r\nI assume material is \"border-box friendly\" because I saw a few similar resolved issues while looking if this has been reported\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This token knows how its value is defined and does not need to trust consumers to provide the value properly + your factory function is not exposed and cannot be used elsewhere. \r\n* You can instantly start using this token without needing to set up anything else / create any other kind of boilerplate code. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you want this token to be provided in a component level, and not the root level, you can't do that. As angular's component \"providers\" property does not allow for InjectionTokens.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport passing an injection token in the \"providers\" array of a component (and module). If this token defines its own factory - it should be used. If not - a runtime exception should be thrown. It's better if we could even type the injection token differently, so only ones that define their factory can be used. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUse the \"FactoryProvider\" syntax, which is less ideal based on what I described above. \r\n\r\nI'm willing to try to implement this myself, if someone with more experience with the Angular source code can point me in the right direction.

This input fields needs to transmit the value via a `[value]` binding and `(input)` event. It also needs to have a `(keydown)` event.\r\nI'll call this implementation the child `ControlValueAcessor`.\r\n\r\nNow you need to have a second implementation of `ControlValueAcessor` that uses the child `ControlValueAcessor` in combinations with an `[(ngModel)]` binding and `(ngModelChange)` event.\r\nThis second implementation then needs to be defined as a `FormControl` in a `FormGroup`.\r\nThe `FormControl` needs to have an error in the `errors` attribute.\r\n\r\nYou now need to have a third component that takes the `errors` from the `FormControl` and renders them in an HTML element with `display: block`.\r\n\r\nIf all conditions are met then the user is no longer able to enter anything into the `<input>` field. However, spamming the keys on my keyboard did work and I was able to get some characters to appear in the `<input>` field.\r\n\r\nI used Firefox 113.0 (32-bit) and Firefox Developer Edition 110.0b9 (64-bit) to test the bug.\r\nI also used Chrome 113.0.5672.93 to test it.\r\nAs far as I can tell, this bug only affects Firefox (both editions).\r\n\r\nI unfortunately couldn't get a Stackblitz to run but I will link a GitHub repository with the code used to produce the bug.\r\n\r\nIf anybody else experiences this bug (which I doubt) there is a workaround as far as I've found.\r\nIn the component that renders the `errors` you just have to implement `OnChanges` with `SimpleChanges` and do a deep copy of the `errors` to a local variable and use that to render. You could also not use `display: block`.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/Leon3131-ux/angularBug\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe user is unable to type anything into the `input` field.

This encourages code that is not modular and not well split, since:\r\n\r\n1. If I want to add a new provider, I have to not only define it on one file, I also have to provide it in another place (the component). before I want to consume it. Ideally - if I can define it in one place, it would make my code more modular. \r\n2. If I want to split a component-level provider to smaller services - I need to add all of them to the component providers list, which makes for a cumbersome code. It's likely that I will be discouraged from doing so for that reason, even though splitting my code to smaller service might make it easier to manage. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd support for specifying a component in the `providedIn`, like was done for modules.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: MyComponent\r\n})\r\nclass MyService {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if I'm using an injection token:\r\n```\r\nconst MY_TOKEN = new InjectionToken('MY_TOKEN', {\r\n  providedIn: MyComponent,\r\n  factory: () => { ... }\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe alternative is to explicitly list the the new provider in the component decorator, which is not ideal because of the reason I described above. I could not find any workaround that enable me to accomplish this with the current tools. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to have a go in trying to implement this, if someone with more experience with Angular source code can point me at the right direction.

If the folder is not present, it will use the declaration files that come with the TypeScript compiler (`/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts`).\r\n\r\nWhen I execute the `ng update` command, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n✔ Packages successfully installed.\r\nUsing package manager: npm\r\nCollecting installed dependencies...\r\nFound 16 dependencies.\r\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\r\n✖ Migration failed: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n  See \".../angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the Angular CLI is trying to fetch `@typescript/lib-dom` but this is not the name of the package, the correct name to fetch is `@types/web`.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created the following repository that reproduces the issue. \r\n\r\nYou don't need to clone it, you can follow the steps explained in the `README.md`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jordimarimon/angular-cli-update-issue\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] HttpErrorGeneral: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n    at /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/npm-registry-fetch/lib/check-response.js:95:15\r\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)\r\n    at async RegistryFetcher.packument (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/pacote/lib/registry.js:87:19)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 3)\r\n    at async /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/update/schematic/index.js:671:36\r\n    at async callRuleAsync (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/rules/call.js:77:18)\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.2.8\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25224","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`ng update` not resolving the correct NPM package when using `npm:<name>` syntax as version range\" (#25224)"},{"Id":"1708763504","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-16T09:04:47","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25209","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency jasmine-core to v5","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [jasmine-core](https://jasmine.github.io) ([source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine)) | devDependencies | major | [`~4.6.0` -> `~5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine-core/4.6.0/5.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.0.0): 5.0.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

now compiles with the ESBuild option (using Angular 16), sass files no longer import external resources (using the `url`) correctly.\r\nEssentially, behavior is such that if a Sass file (let's call it module A) imports another sass file (let's call it module B), and module B lives in a different directory than Module A, and Module B uses a url to point to a relative file (like a font file), when Sass compiles everything into a single Sass file, the url that's used from Module B remains the same (which is relative to the original Module B location), resulting in errors around resolving file locations (because the compiled file doesn't have the same file location as the original).\r\nOriginal behavior didn't care about this, and the compiled output correctly brought linked files up and changed the url paths.\r\nWhile ESBuild is called a \"drop-in\" replacement, this needs to be resolved.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

This was particularly useful for updating values in real-time during a drag operation. For instance, consider the following setup:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"minSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"maxSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync dragSliderStartMin(index: number) {\r\n  await this.loadFile(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nminSliderValueChange(value: number, index: number) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the newly released v16.0.0, this behavior appears to have changed. The `valueChange` event only emits a value when the slider dragging operation ends, as opposed to continuously during the drag.\r\n\r\nTo restore the previous behavior, one workaround I found is using `ngModel` for template-driven binding:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    [(ngModel)]=\"sliderValue\"\r\n    (ngModelChange)=\"sliderValueChange($event)\"\r\n    matSliderThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I achieved the same result by using `formControl` with reactive forms and subscribing to `valueChange`:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMin($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMax($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.addSubscriptions();\r\n}\r\n\r\naddSubscriptions() {\r\n  this.expectationMin(this.index)\r\n    .valueChanges.pipe(distinctUntilChanged())\r\n    .subscribe((value) => {\r\n      console.log('min value changed', value);\r\n      this.minSliderValueChange(value, this.index);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  // same for expectationMax and maxSliderValueChange\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring up this change in behavior as it may impact other users who relied on the continuous value emission during slider drags in their projects. Can anyone confirm if this change was intentional or if it's a bug?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduction of the issue in Angular v16.0.0\r\n\r\nNavigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v16.0.0: [Angular 16 slider with valueChanges showing value only when drag ends](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-xdmmkz?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, notice that when you drag the slider, the value changes are only displayed when the dragging ends. This is the behavior we're discussing in this issue.\r\n\r\n2. Comparison with the behavior in Angular v15.1.0\r\n\r\nNow, navigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v15.1.0: [Angular 15, same source code, slider with valueChanges showing value when dragging the slider](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-fmmekv?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, when you drag the slider, the value changes are continuously displayed next to the slider as you're dragging. This is the previous behavior we're comparing to.\r\n\r\nBy observing the behavior in both versions of Angular with the same source code, you can clearly see the difference in valueChange event emissions during slider dragging.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 15.1.0, the `valueChange` event used with `matSliderThumb` was designed to emit values continuously as the slider was being dragged. This enabled real-time value updates during a drag operation. I expect to see this same behavior in Angular Material version 16.0.0.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 16.0.0, the `valueChange` event's behavior appears to have changed. Instead of emitting values continuously during the slider dragging operation, it now only emits a value when the slider drag operation ends. This change interrupts real-time value updates and only allows for updates when the user releases the slider.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Version 113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs Ventura, Version 13.3.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27097","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`valueChange` Event in v16.0.0 No Longer Emits Values Continuously During Slider Drag\" (#27097)"},{"Id":"1709995842","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T12:26:17","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"27098","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n13.3.9\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen using `dateFilter` on the date picker, the `selectedChange` event never emit\r\n\r\nfrom what I'm seeing in https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration, the date picker doesn't have any breaking changes, if I'm wrong please refer me to what I need to update to make it work again (and if possible please fix the reprod)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. use `mat-calendar` normally\r\n2. use `dateFilter` for it\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-syqmnz?file=src/main.ts\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event to emit\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event does not emit\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.2 (same behavior with 14.0.6)\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27098","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly\" (#27098)"},{"Id":"1709532152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T09:10:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create ng add integration test using ng new","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `ng add` integration test to run `ng new` first which should make it easier to keep up with changes to the project layout.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27096","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create ng add integration test using ng new\" (#27096)"},{"Id":"1709262962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T03:46:54","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"27095","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): SASS Theming Extension functions for button colors","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a utility API for button colors that could be used both internally and by external clients.\r\n\r\n[For example the Fab button](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/button/_fab-theme.scss) defines a `_fab-variant` mixin like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin _fab-variant($foreground, $background) {\r\n  @include mdc-fab-theme.theme((\r\n    container-color: $background,\r\n    icon-color: $foreground,\r\n  ));\r\n\r\n  --mat-mdc-fab-color: #{$foreground};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can't use this outside of Angular because its private.\r\n\r\nSomething like this can be used both within the current code base and as a client facing API for extending the Fab button colors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin fab-variant($color-class, $foreground, $background) {\r\n  &.#{ $color-class } {\r\n    @include mdc-fab-theme.theme(\r\n      (\r\n        container-color: $background,\r\n        icon-color: $foreground,\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n    background-color: var(--mdc-fab-container-color, transparent);\r\n    color: var(--mdc-fab-icon-color, inherit);\r\n    --mat-mdc-button-persistent-ripple-color: #{$foreground};\r\n    --mat-mdc-button-ripple-color: rgba(#{$foreground}, .1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt can be called like this with color extensions for the Fab button.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .mat-mdc-fab {\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-success, $on-success, $success);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-danger, $on-danger, $danger);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-info, $on-info, $info);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso `_mdc-helpers` is also private.

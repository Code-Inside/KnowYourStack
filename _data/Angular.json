I have been playing with it quite a lot (19.2 and recently v20) and I noticed some friction points that could maybe be addressed (I realise it is still experimental).\n\n1) httpResource uses HttpClient under the hood - but that isn't really clear. If you \"just want to use it\" and haven't included provideHttpClient - you get the (quite unfriendly) R3InjectorError. From a DX point of view that seems strange as that error doesn't mention HttpResource, just HttpClient. Would a friendly message (\"HttpResource uses HttpClient, please provide it\") - be an option?\n\n2) Since v20, if the HttpResource goes into error state, the value() signal throws. I think it is good that you need to handle or guard reading .value() - however, because the uncaught error doesn't go through the Error Handler - the error is generates doesn't tell you anything on where in the code that error was triggered (or uncaught). Would it be possible for specifically HttpResource to internally route that error through the Error Handler so it shows where in the template of component you have an un-guarded .value() read? (related to #60219)\n\n3) To align behaviour (somewhat) with resource, would it be an option to consider that when a provided signal that is somewhere in the HttpResource URL is undefined, the resource won't do the request? Now the entire URL needs to be undefined to prevent a call.\n\n4) More of a question maybe - but why is httpResource.hasValue not a signal? I can imagine scenarios where an effect or computed can respond to that signal being true is useful? \n\n5) Really HOT take here  - but I can see much more usage scenarios and easier adoption by juniors if httpResource doesn't need to run  in InjectionContext.  Would it possible to inject Injector internally? I understand there might be issues with cleanup and stuff - but I worry that loads of newbies will just eagerly start loading resources with it - because it's \"too difficult\" to make it lazy (on user interaction etc). HttpClient just wins here on best practises.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nHopefully improve some friction for better adoption of this nice abstraction.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNot relevant.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61789","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: HttpResource DX improvements and error handling\" (#61789)"},{"Id":"3104078424","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T19:28:08","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61787","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(router): Update view transition types to dev preview","State":"open","Body":"This updates the documented state of the view transition interfaces.

The build used to generate the following files (among others):\n\n- index.d.ts, which exported everything from public_api;\n- public_api.d.ts, which imported './jasmine-matchers' and exported everything from a bunch of other files;\n- jasmine-matchers.d.ts, defining the additional matchers\n\nAfter the upgrade, the build only has an index.d.ts, where doesn't contain any sign of the jasmine matchers.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos.git\ngit checkout chore/ng20\npnpm i\npnpm ng build --project ngx-speculoos\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 20.19.2\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.11.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nng-packagr                   20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30425","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing typing in library after upgrade to v20\" (#30425)"},{"Id":"3101017799","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T07:31:52","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30417","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://redirect.github.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7cfe265` -> `72c1576` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `19bc34b` -> `6432566` |\n| [@angular/common](https://redirect.github.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `17c05d9` -> `1719d2c` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `085de16` -> `d520b3c` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c2c2066` -> `340c825` |\n| [@angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `617232b` -> `afe57a7` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://redirect.github.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b40d2a9` -> `13a3bb1` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://redirect.github.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f79c923` -> `9c8e371` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://redirect.github.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b535694` -> `b6d2242` |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `02b3f86` -> `de5bb25` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e27e75c` -> `037961f` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a06cf8f` -> `ded5d2b` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5e211c3` -> `d50dc73` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `680dfb6` -> `2af3f92` |\n| [@angular/router](https://redirect.github.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `447744e` -> `3a1a067` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://redirect.github.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d308893` -> `8f6b072` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

During the migration process, the Angular CLI encountered the following error:\n\n`Migration failed: require() of ES Module /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/ora/index.js from /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js not supported.\nInstead change the require of index.js in /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.`\n\n## Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Run the command `ng new dealer-client` to create a new Angular project.\n2. Notice that this creates the project using Angular **19.2** (despite specifying Angular 20).\n3. Run the command `ng update @angular/core@20 @angular/cli@20` to upgrade the Angular CLI and dependencies to version 20.\n4. During the migration process, the error is triggered when the migration reaches the step for updating application projects to the new build system.\n\n## Expected Behavior:\n\nThe update and migration process should complete successfully without errors, including any optional migration tasks like updating the build system.\n\n## Actual Behavior:\n\nThe migration fails with the following error message:\n\nMigration failed: require() of ES Module /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/ora/index.js from /tmp/angular-cli-packages-BFPht2/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.js not supported.\n\n## Possible Cause:\n\nThe error seems related to the attempt to `require()` an ES module (`ora/index.js`) from a CommonJS context. It appears that the current migration process might not be fully compatible with ES modules, which causes the failure.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n- This issue may be related to specific Node.js versions or dependency versions, so any additional insights into handling ES module compatibility in the migration process would be helpful.\n- I have attempted to perform the migration using both a clean setup and an existing project, with the same result.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n```true\nSelect the migrations that you'd like to run [use-application-builder] Migrate application projects to the new build system.

While this behavior aligns with accessibility guidelines (WCAG), it creates a **usability issue** for the user interface.\n\nThe `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are not merely decorative animations — they are **functional indicators** of background activity (e.g., data loading, request processing). Disabling animations entirely when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled renders these components static, which can mislead users into thinking the interface is \"frozen\" or unresponsive. This is especially problematic in **single-page applications (SPAs)**, where these components often serve as replacements for native browser loading indicators.\n\nI intentionally enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in Windows 10 to reduce distracting or resource-heavy animations, such as window transitions. However, even with this setting enabled, browsers like **Firefox** and **Chrome** still provide **minimal animations** (e.g., tab loading spinners) to indicate progress. In SPAs, where we rely on custom loading indicators like `mat-progress-bar`, the absence of any animation severely impacts UX.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active, the `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` components in `indeterminate` mode should support a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** to maintain their role as activity indicators. For example:\n\n- **mat-progress-bar**: A subtle bar movement or pulsation, avoiding abrupt transitions.\n- **mat-progress-spinner**: A slow rotation or pulsation instead of complete animation disablement.\n\nAdditionally, developers should be able to **opt-in** to minimal animations via:\n\n- Module configuration (`MatProgressBarModule`, `MatProgressSpinnerModule`)\n- Token-based control (e.g., `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS`)\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting in **Windows 10**:\n   - Go to **Settings → Ease of Access → Display**\n   - Turn off **\"Show animations in Windows\"**\n\n2. Create an Angular application using **Angular Material 20**.\n\n3.

I found bug #27057 which appears to be about a related problem  in the old MDC migration,\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Migrate an existing Angular Material app on Windows to Angular 20 using \"ng update\".\n2. Um, why are we touching most of the files and changing their encodings?\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the migration has nothing to do to a file, it should do nothing to that file.  And if it does happen to need to change a file for the variable token replacements, it shouldn't switch that file's encoding.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDozens of files in my tree with no substantive changes but with encoding switched from UTF-8 to Windows-1252.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.3.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@angular/cdk                 20.0.1\n@angular/material            20.0.1\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nng-packagr                   20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(migrations): Angular 20 update migrations stripping BOM from UTF8 files that have them\" (#31263)"},{"Id":"3103445910","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T14:43:41","Actor":"json-derulo","Number":"31262","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(button): variants table not rendered properly","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThe table with the button variants is not rendered properly, it seems like the markdown string is displayed as-is:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/532094ae-cefa-4644-a805-ccb1e07b2571)\n\nStrangely enough, another table on the same page is rendered correctly. \n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/button/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31262","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(button): variants table not rendered properly\" (#31262)"},{"Id":"3102366059","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T07:40:10","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31260","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): brand family not set for plain value","State":"open","Body":"If a non-map value is set for the `typography`, we were only setting the plain font family while the brand one was falling back to Roboto.\r\n\r\nFixes #31254.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31260","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): brand family not set for plain value\" (#31260)"},{"Id":"3102251881","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T06:44:55","Actor":"dinesh250-star","Number":"31259","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Angular 20 Migration issue","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhile migrating from angular material 19 to 20, on cli there is a message that says -\n\n\"UPDATE some/dummy/file/path1 (869 bytes)\n UPDATE some/dummy/file/path2 (7981 bytes)\nUPDATE some/dummy/file/path2018 (7981 bytes)\n UPDATE some/dummy/file/path2019 (194 bytes)\n\n Migration completed (2109 files modified).\" \n\n But on my git I can only see 25 file that have been modified from the script.

scroll 'flickering' with zoneless","State":"open","Body":"This fixes the perceived flickering due to the transform sometimes becoming visible with zoneless due to the macrotask-based scheduler. The transform cannot be simply moved inside `afterNextRender` because it causes differences in timing that can break certain scroll implementations (http://b/335066372).\r\n\r\nThis approach fiddles with the details of `ngZone.run` and avoiding unnecessary extra ApplicationRef.tick calls. We could instead put everything inside an ngZone.run and call ApplicationRef.tick in there, but that would result in a second tick when the `ngZone.run` exits.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31240","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/scrolling): Prevent virtual scroll 'flickering' with zoneless\" (#31240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-01T03:30:02.4959392Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1358}

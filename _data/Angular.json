The goal here is twofold:\r\n\r\n- Separate the Router's logic into more manageable chunks. Rather than\r\n  having to always edit a 1000+ line file, this separates different\r\n  pieces into smaller, more focused files\r\n- More importantly, this sets the groundwork for separating the Router\r\n  state from the individual navigation transition. That is, it would be\r\n  good for the rxjs pipeline to _not_ modify the Router state but only\r\n  keep track of its own intermediate stages and emit outwards during\r\n  important events. The Router can subscribe to those events and make\r\n  updates to its state. This would theoretically allow us to swap those\r\n  implementations independently. That is, the Router's state management\r\n  can be changed without changing the transition handling and\r\n  vice-versa.\r\n\r\nReviewer note: This change is split up into two commits. The first copies the `router.ts` file to a new file without changes. The second commit updates the code. This is done to better show the diff in the `navigation_transitions.ts` file. If only git supported file branching hints.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48092","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): Move navigation transition logic into a separate file\" (#48092)"},{"Id":"1452172878","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-16T19:39:13","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"48091","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): evaluate const tuple types statically","State":"open","Body":"For standalone components it may be beneficial to group multiple declarations into a single array, that can then be imported all at once in `Component.imports`.

  </lr-hs-vs>\r\n```\r\nlike above individually these DomPortalOutlets are working fine.\r\nBut if I use the same like below,\r\n   ``````\r\n\r\n <tb-hst-vst>\r\n        <div>tesrf</div>\r\n

parent web app seem to be overriding styles from my web components particularly for native elements like <input/> and <p/>. \r\nSo I was wondering if this behavior is normal and in that case what can be done to encapsulate and make all my web component's styles take priority. \r\nAlso when I name my classes something like \"alert\", it gets overridden by bootstrap's class names from the parent webapp. \r\nAre there any best practices when writing styles for web components which differs from the usual workflow when developing a web app?\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

[`v0.15.14`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01514)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.13...v0.15.14)\n\n-   Fix parsing of TypeScript `infer` inside a conditional `extends` ([#&#8203;2675](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2675))\n\n    Unlike JavaScript, parsing TypeScript sometimes requires backtracking. The `infer A` type operator can take an optional constraint of the form `infer A extends B`. However, this syntax conflicts with the similar conditional type operator `A extends B ? C : D` in cases where the syntax is combined, such as `infer A extends B ? C : D`. This is supposed to be parsed as `(infer A) extends B ? C : D`. Previously esbuild incorrectly parsed this as `(infer A extends B) ? C : D` instead, which is a parse error since the `?:` conditional operator requires the `extends` keyword as part of the conditional type. TypeScript disambiguates by speculatively parsing the `extends` after the `infer`, but backtracking if a `?` token is encountered afterward. With this release, esbuild should now do the same thing, so esbuild should now correctly parse these types. Here's a real-world example of such a type:\n\n    ```ts\n    type Normalized<T> = T extends Array<infer A extends object ? infer A : never>\n      ? Dictionary<Normalized<A>>\n      : {\n          [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends Array<infer A extends object ? infer A : never>\n            ? Dictionary<Normalized<A>>\n            : Normalized<T[P]>\n        }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid unnecessary watch mode rebuilds when debug logging is enabled ([#&#8203;2661](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2661))\n\n    When debug-level logs are enabled (such as with `--log-level=debug`), esbuild's path resolution subsystem generates debug log messages that say something like \"Read 20 entries for directory /home/user\" to help you debug what esbuild's path resolution is doing. This caused esbuild's watch mode subsystem to add a dependency on the full list of entries in that directory since if that changes, the generated log message would also have to be updated. However, meant that on systems where a parent directory undergoes constant directory entry churn, esbuild's watch mode would continue to rebuild if `--log-level=debug` was passed.\n\n    With this release, these debug log messages are now generated by \"peeking\" at the file system state while bypassing esbuild's watch mode dependency tracking. So now watch mode doesn't consider the count of directory entries in these debug log messages to be a part of the build that needs to be kept up to date when the file system state changes.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v2.7.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;270-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribmini-css-extract-plugincomparev261v270-2022-11-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add function support for locals (loader) ([#&#8203;985](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/985)) ([65519d0](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/65519d0701b3c5d60585468b8220159cbbfbe6b8))\n\n##### [2.6.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1) (2022-06-15)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   do not attempt hot reloading when emit is false ([#&#8203;953](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/953)) ([b426f04](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/b426f04961846991e8ca671c6a4d48e6a83a46c2))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.0`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1500-httpsgithubcomng-packagrng-packagrcompare1500-rc01500-2022-11-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/15.0.0-rc.0...15.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   ng-packagr no longer supports Node.js versions `14.[15-19].x` and `16.[10-12].x`. Current supported versions of Node.js are `14.20.x`, `16.13.x` and `18.10.x`.\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.8.2 are no longer supported.\n-   Deprecated support for Stylus has been removed. The Stylus package has never reached a stable version and it's usage in the ng-packagr is minimal. It's recommended to migrate to another CSS preprocessor that the ng-packagr supports.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add support for tailwindcss ([fdc0707](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/fdc07079cb2f2f947a72176011e02c7fa2a3c2fa)), closes [#&#8203;1943](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1943)\n-   add support for Node.js version 18 ([e70e3a3](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/e70e3a3547cfdb131608d6a015c528ca64bde629))\n-   drop support for TypeScript 4.6 and 4.7 ([56d9a85](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/56d9a8558cbc4efa17e7e7e965dea046de90dba7))\n-   switch to sass modern API ([b1ebee3](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/b1ebee34c7c89cb3d91cb49c74b9c013e84da125))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   grammatical update error message ([6d7d2a9](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/6d7d2a97b2c9586bce51a92d3918051be0441460))\n-   remove support for Stylus ([2f92ab8](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/2f92ab8e6dabc75d6e4f5793b7de6115848bdf6c))\n-   emit TypeScript declaration diagnostics ([844ea6c](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/844ea6c6c6b414c192aa0e5fcce7adfbfda0e439)), closes [#&#8203;2405](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/2405)\n-   exclude scanning node_modules when trying to locate README.md ([b54159b](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/b54159bf5f9d8fcb57126a37fdfa33443c2f58c2)), closes [#&#8203;2418](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/2418)\n-   exclude scanning nested node_modules when locating `README.md` ([4e4c00b](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/4e4c00bf67d2dcb932da5404cc36703e49556594)), closes [#&#8203;2459](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/2459)\n-   show actionable error when component resource is not found ([5dcba25](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/5dcba25c284b55f407ddd6bdc7db59ce5436bcca))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Currently the `verbose` option doesn't give enough info.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nmaybe something like `ng build --timing`, with granular logs for things such as:\r\n\r\n`moved asset y: 20ms`\r\n`built file x using esbuild: 30ms`\r\n`built file z using some other internal module: 30ms`\r\n\r\nThis would help us all understand better what the bottlenecks in the compiler are.

[`v15.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1500-2022-11-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/15.0.0-rc.4...15.0.0)\n\n[Blog post \"Angular v15 is now available\"](http://goo.gle/angular-v15).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Keyframes names are now prefixed with the component's \"scope name\".\n    For example, the following keyframes rule in a component definition,\n    whose \"scope name\" is host-my-cmp:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) foo { ... }\n\n    will become:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) host-my-cmp_foo { ... }\n\n    Any TypeScript/JavaScript code which relied on the names of keyframes rules\n    will no longer match.\n\n    The recommended solutions in this case are to either:\n\n    -   change the component's view encapsulation to the `None` or `ShadowDom`\n    -   define keyframes rules in global stylesheets (e.g styles.css)\n    -   define keyframes rules programmatically in code.\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n-   Invalid constructors for DI may now report compilation errors\n\n    When a class inherits its constructor from a base class, the compiler may now\n    report an error when that constructor cannot be used for DI purposes. This may\n    either be because the base class is missing an Angular decorator such as\n    `@Injectable()` or `@Directive()`, or because the constructor contains parameters\n    which do not have an associated token (such as primitive types like `string`).\n    These situations used to behave unexpectedly at runtime, where the class may be\n    constructed without any of its constructor parameters, so this is now reported\n    as an error during compilation.\n\n    Any new errors that may be reported because of this change can be resolved either\n    by decorating the base class from which the constructor is inherited, or by adding\n    an explicit constructor to the class for which the error is reported.\n-   Angular compiler option `enableIvy` has been removed as Ivy is the only rendering engine.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular no longer supports Node.js versions `14.[15-19].x` and `16.[10-12].x`. Current supported versions of Node.js are `14.20.x`, `16.13.x` and `18.10.x`.\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.8 are no longer supported.\n-   Existing iframe usages may have security-sensitive attributes applied as an attribute or property binding in a template or via host bindings in a directive. Such usages would require an update to ensure compliance with the new stricter rules around iframe bindings.\n-   Existing iframe usages may have `src` or `srcdoc` preceding other attributes. Such usages may need to be updated to ensure compliance with the new stricter rules around iframe bindings.\n\n##### forms\n\n-   setDisabledState will always be called when a `ControlValueAccessor` is attached. You can opt-out with `FormsModule.withConfig` or `ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig`.\n\n##### localize\n\n-   -   `canParse` method has been removed from all translation parsers in `@angular/localize/tools`. `analyze` should be used instead.\n    -   the `hint` parameter in the`parse` methods is now mandatory.\n\n##### router\n\n-   Previously, the `RouterOutlet` would immediately\n    instantiate the component being activated during navigation. Now the\n    component is not instantiated until the change detection runs. This\n    could affect tests which do not trigger change detection after a router\n    navigation. In rarer cases, this can affect production code that relies\n    on the exact timing of component availability.\n-   The title property is now required on ActivatedRouteSnapshot\n-   `relativeLinkResolution` is no longer configurable in\n    the Router. This option was used as a means to opt out of a bug fix.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   The `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` token is now deprecated in favor\n    of the `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` token, which accepts an object\n    as a value and the timezone can be defined as a field (called `timezone`)\n    on that object.\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   The ability to pass an `NgModule` to the `providedIn` option for\n        `@Injectable` and `InjectionToken` is now deprecated.\n\n    `providedIn: NgModule` was intended to be a tree-shakable alternative to\n    NgModule providers. It does not have wide usage, and in most cases is used\n    incorrectly, in circumstances where `providedIn: 'root'` should be\n    preferred. If providers should truly be scoped to a specific NgModule, use\n    `NgModule.providers` instead.\n\n    -   The ability to set `providedIn: 'any'` for an `@Injectable` or\n        `InjectionToken` is now deprecated.\n\n    `providedIn: 'any'` is an option with confusing semantics and is almost\n    never used apart from a handful of esoteric cases internal to the framework.\n-   The bit field signature of `Injector.get()` has been deprecated, in favor of the new options object.\n-   The bit field signature of `TestBed.inject()` has been deprecated, in favor of the new options object.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RouterLinkWithHref` directive is deprecated, use the `RouterLink` directive instead.

-->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1500-diamond-dinosaur-2022-11-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/14.2.7...15.0.0)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### material\n\n-   The following components have been re-implemented based on MDC:\n    -   `mat-autocomplete`\n    -   `mat-button`\n    -   `mat-fab`\n    -   `mat-icon-button`\n    -   `mat-card`\n    -   `mat-chip-list` (now split into the following three components: `mat-chip-set`, `mat-chip-listbox`, and `mat-chip-grid` to better represent the different interaction patterns)\n    -   `mat-option`\n    -   `mat-optgroup`\n    -   `mat-dialog` (passing strings for MatDialogConfig.enterAnimationDuration and\n        MatDialogConfig.exitAnimationDuration is deprecated, pass numbers\n        in ms instead)\n    -   `mat-action-list`\n    -   `mat-list`\n    -   `mat-list-item`\n    -   `mat-list-option`\n    -   `mat-nav-list`\n    -   `mat-selection-list`\n    -   `mat-menu`\n    -   `mat-radio-group`\n    -   `mat-radio-button`\n    -   `mat-select`\n    -   `mat-slide-toggle`\n    -   `mat-slider` (has a new API that requires a `<input matSliderThumb>` element)\n    -   `mat-snack-bar`\n    -   `mat-table`\n    -   `mat-tabs`\n-   The TypeScript API should remain largely unchanged, but the DOM and CSS classes for these components have changed.\n-   See the MDC migration guide for more information about the changes and\n    how to migrate your app: https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration.\n-   Buttons inside the datepicker popup and datepicker toggle now use the\n    MDC-based button implementation. They have different CSS classes and\n    styles, so custom style overrides may need to be updated.\n\n##### material-luxon-adapter\n\n-   The `MatLuxonDateModule` now requires at least version 3 of

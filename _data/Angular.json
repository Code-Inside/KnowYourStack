However, this seems to work quite well and quicky so far for detecting changes and seems to avoid the necessity of changing everything to use immutable types or having to rewrite all my components to use Signals (or any of the other workarounds).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution would be to move a similar injectChangeDetectionProxies function inside angular where it could be activated for any component behind a new ChangeDetectionStrategy.DeepProxy change detection strategy flag.\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore, instead of calling cdr.markForCheck() these proxies could instead enqueue/map their property name + new value changes where they could be later be applied during the change cycle.\r\n\r\nThis would have several advantages over existing change detection strategies:\r\n(1) The expensive tree traversal to detect changes no longer becomes necessary at all and could be avoided completely. Instead of calling cdr.markForCheck() the Proxy could immediately queue/map the exact parameter name and new value of the change that needs to take place. Later, what was previously the change detection cycle could instead traverse just the exact list of changes that need to take place and apply them.\r\n(2) Users would not have to refactor their code to use immutable structures, make manual calls to cdr.markForCheck(), use Signals, etc. etc. in order to take advantage of the performance boost.\r\n(3) Proxied objects are theoretically meant to be somewhat transparent. So in theory, anything that doesn't properly Proxy could potentially be flagged as a bug in JavaScript and bumped upstream to the language developers.\r\n\r\nThe Angular developers are also in a unique position to make sure that these Proxy's only get applied to objects/properties used in the template for even more targeted updates.\r\n\r\nThat isn't to say that there aren't also some challenges to using Proxy objects everywhere:\r\n(1) Map (and possibly File objects) don't seem to like being proxied very much. And possibly others. These sorts of issues could maybe be bumped upstream but would maybe require workarounds or warnings in the documentation in the short term.\r\n(2) Circular references in the Component's object tree (such as parent references) are something to be careful about (but were actually relatively easy to work around by marking already proxied objects).\r\n(3) Proxing of the Component tree incurs some extra cost at load time in exchange for the improved speed later at runtime.\r\n(4) And probably some others surprises I haven't thought of.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, here is some of my working implementation to highlight the basic idea:\r\n```\r\nconst isProxy = Symbol(\"isProxy\");\r\nconst isProxying = Symbol(\"isProxying\");\r\n\r\ntype HandlerType = {\r\n    set: (target: object, path: PropertyKey[], value: any, receiver: any)=>void,\r\n    deleteProperty: (target: object, path: PropertyKey[]) => void, \r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isInstance(obj: any, cls: any): boolean {\r\n  try {\r\n    return obj instanceof cls;\r\n  } catch {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isProxyable(obj: any): boolean {\r\n  return (obj !== undefined && obj !== null && typeof obj === \"object\" &&\r\n    !obj[isProxy] && !(isInstance(obj, Map) && !(isInstance(obj, File))));\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function createDeepProxy(target: any, handler: HandlerType, skipKeys: PropertyKey[], key: PropertyKey): any {\r\n    function makeHandler(path: PropertyKey[]) {\r\n      return {\r\n        set(target: object, key: PropertyKey, value: any, receiver: any) {\r\n          if (!(key as string).startsWith(\"_\") && !skipKeys.includes(key as string) && isProxyable(value)) {\r\n            value = proxify(value, [...path, key], skipKeys);\r\n          }\r\n          target[key] = value;\r\n          \r\n          if (handler.set) {\r\n            handler.set(target, [...path, key], value, receiver);\r\n          }\r\n          return true;\r\n        },\r\n        get(target: object, key: PropertyKey) {\r\n          // This allows us to check if this object has already been proxied.\r\n          // From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36372611/how-to-test-if-an-object-is-a-proxy\r\n          if (key == isProxy) {\r\n            return true;\r\n          }\r\n          return target[key];\r\n        },\r\n        deleteProperty(target: object, key: PropertyKey) {\r\n          if (Reflect.has(target, key)) {\r\n            const deleted = Reflect.deleteProperty(target, key);\r\n            if (deleted && handler.deleteProperty) {\r\n              handler.deleteProperty(target, [...path, key]);\r\n            }\r\n            return deleted;\r\n          }\r\n          // Returning true to avoid messages like:\r\n          // ERROR TypeError: 'deleteProperty' on proxy: trap returned falsish for property 'fromTime'\r\n          // Deleting a property that doesn't exist does not normally generate an error.\r\n          // So this shouldn't generate one either (IMHO).\r\n          return true;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function proxify(obj: any, path: PropertyKey[], skipKeys: PropertyKey[]): any {\r\n      // These initial checks are largely to avoid re-proxifying an object that\r\n      // has already been proxified.

Without a setter\r\n          // there is nothing we can proxify.\r\n          if (descriptor?.get === undefined) {\r\n            obj[key] = proxify(obj[key], [...path, key], skipKeys);\r\n          } else if (descriptor.set !== undefined) {\r\n            console.log(\"setter proxying is not implemented\");\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      delete obj[isProxying];\r\n      return new Proxy(obj, makeHandler(path));\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    return proxify(target, [key], skipKeys);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function getDetectingProxy(target: any, cdr: ChangeDetectorRef, skipKeys: PropertyKey[], key: string): any {\r\n    return createDeepProxy(target, {\r\n      set() {\r\n        //console.log('set', path.join('.'));\r\n        cdr.markForCheck();\r\n      },\r\n      deleteProperty() {\r\n        //console.log('delete', path.join('.'));\r\n        cdr.markForCheck();\r\n      }\r\n    }, skipKeys, key);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy apologies as the above code could use a bunch of cleanup.\r\n\r\nThe usage of this would be something like:\r\n`const proxiedThis = getDetectingProxy(this, this._cdr);`\r\n\r\nThe following stack overflow is a good starting point for how to write a deep proxy:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/43177855/how-to-create-a-deep-proxy-aka-proxy-membrane\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to answer any questions or discuss this further.\r\n\r\n###

Only the header for the file name is visible, but the actual code example preview is missing.\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, I checked the Angular repository for the same documentation and found that the code example preview is added using the `<docs-code />` tag in the markdown file. However, there seems to be an issue with the attribute assigned to it, specifically the `visibleRegion` attribute.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `visibleRegion` attribute makes the code example visible, albeit not as expected. It appears that this attribute is intended to select a particular section or region of the code to be visible in the example. However, due to some error with this attribute, the code example is not displaying correctly.\r\n\r\nI have attempted some debugging to identify the root cause of the issue, but I am not entirely sure about the exact problem. Therefore, I'm creating this issue to bring attention to the problem and provide the details I have gathered through my debugging process.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior:\r\nThe code example preview should be visible in the \"Template Syntax\" section of the Angular v17 documentation, displaying the relevant code snippet as intended.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior:\r\nOnly the header for the file name is visible, while the code example preview is missing. Removing the visibleRegion attribute temporarily resolves the issue, but the code example does not display as expected.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit the Angular v17 documentation on [angular.dev](https://angular.dev).\r\n2. Navigate to the **\"Template Syntax\"** section in **\"docs\"**.\r\n3. Navigate through **\"sub-section\" / \"sub-pages\"**.\r\n4. Observe that the code example preview is not visible.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information:\r\n\r\nAngular version: v17\r\nDocumentation link: [First page where issue

I will fallback and so on.\r\n\r\nI tried even with the build in http client but even that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.http.get(`/numbro_languages/${localeId}.min.js`, {responseType:'arraybuffer'}).pipe(\r\n      catchError(this.handleError())\r\n    ).subscribe((value) => {\r\n            console.log(value);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nit already report something even if i have a pipe with a catchErrror\r\n\r\n\r\nbesides that the locales for Numbro that i need to load seems to work really different..\r\ninstead of just doing this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  return import(`numbro/languages/${localeId}`).then(module => {\r\n            numbro.registerLanguage(module.default);\r\n            numbro.setLanguage(localeId);\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\ni now need todo this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n return import(`/numbro_languages/${localeId}.min.js`).then(module => {\r\n            numbro.registerLanguage(this.windowService.nativeWindow['numbro'][localeId]);\r\n            numbro.setLanguage(localeId);\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause that min.js file looks like this that numbro ships:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst u = undefined;\r\nfunction plural(val) {\r\n    const n = val, i = Math.floor(Math.abs(val)), v = val.toString().replace(/^[^.]*\\.?/, '').length;\r\n    if (i === 1 && v === 0)\r\n        return 1;\r\n    return 5;\r\n}\r\nexport default [\"nl\", [[\"a.m.\", \"p.m.\"], u, u], u, [[\"Z\", \"M\", \"D\", \"W\", \"D\", \"V\", \"Z\"], [\"zo\", \"ma\", \"di\", \"wo\", \"do\", \"vr\", \"za\"], [\"zondag\", \"maandag\", \"dinsdag\", \"woensdag\", \"donderdag\", \"vrijdag\", \"zaterdag\"], [\"zo\", \"ma\", \"di\", \"wo\", \"do\", \"vr\", \"za\"]], u, [[\"J\", \"F\", \"M\", \"A\", \"M\", \"J\", \"J\", \"A\", \"S\", \"O\", \"N\", \"D\"], [\"jan.\", \"feb.\", \"mrt.\", \"apr.\", \"mei\", \"jun.\", \"jul.\", \"aug.\", \"sep.\", \"okt.\", \"nov.\", \"dec.\"], [\"januari\", \"februari\", \"maart\", \"april\", \"mei\", \"juni\", \"juli\", \"augustus\", \"september\", \"oktober\", \"november\", \"december\"]], u, [[\"v.C.\", \"n.C.\"], [\"v.Chr.\", \"n.Chr.\"], [\"voor Christus\", \"na Christus\"]], 1, [6, 0], [\"dd-MM-y\", \"d MMM y\", \"d MMMM y\", \"EEEE d MMMM y\"], [\"HH:mm\", \"HH:mm:ss\", \"HH:mm:ss z\", \"HH:mm:ss zzzz\"], [\"{1} {0}\", u, \"{1} 'om' {0}\", u], [\",\", \".\", \";\", \"%\", \"+\", \"-\", \"E\", \"×\", \"‰\", \"∞\", \"NaN\", \":\"], [\"#,##0.###\", \"#,##0%\", \"¤ #,##0.00;¤ -#,##0.00\", \"#E0\"], \"EUR\", \"€\", \"Euro\", { \"AUD\": [\"AU$\", \"$\"], \"BYN\": [u, \"р.\"], \"CAD\": [\"C$\", \"$\"], \"FJD\": [\"FJ$\", \"$\"], \"JPY\": [\"JP¥\", \"¥\"], \"PHP\": [u, \"₱\"], \"RUR\": [u, \"р.\"], \"SBD\": [\"SI$\", \"$\"], \"THB\": [\"฿\"], \"TWD\": [\"NT$\"], \"USD\": [\"US$\", \"$\"], \"XPF\": [], \"XXX\": [] }, \"ltr\", plural];\r\n```\r\n\r\nor another version that they also ship is\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    languageTag: \"nl-NL\",\r\n    delimiters: {\r\n        thousands: \".\",\r\n        decimal: \",\"\r\n    },\r\n    abbreviations: {\r\n        thousand: \"k\",\r\n        million: \"mln\",\r\n        billion: \"mrd\",\r\n        trillion: \"bln\"\r\n    },\r\n    ordinal: (number) => {\r\n        let remainder = number % 100;\r\n        return (number !== 0 && remainder <= 1 || remainder === 8 || remainder >= 20) ?

It's working perfectly, both with `ng build` and `ng serve`. It uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` builder. To support a new feature, I needed to swap a file when running the live-reload mode with `ng serve`. Following the documentation for `fileReplacements`, I added:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n            \"serve\": {\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n              \"ssr\": false\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI now get the following error when running `ng serve`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe regex pattern does not match what builds without replacement are actually using. Regular builds support `\"\\.(([cm]?[jt])sx?|json)$\"`. However, the pattern itself is questionable: why even limit the file extensions here? I don't need it right now, but what if I wanted to swap a `.wasm` file or any other kind of file? If a regular build works, adding a file replacement rule should never restrict it more.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd a file replacement rule targeting an `mts` file. Example:\r\n```\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the corresponding command (`ng build`, `ng serve`)\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n$ ng version\r\nNode.js version v21.6.1 detected.\r\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

Those templates are made for a specific CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 4). Developers using this framework might have or want to use a different CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 5). I want to update the framework to support multiple of those CSS/HTML Libraries. Unfortunately there is no option in angular at the moment to reach this goal, so all the logic must be applied before starting the building process. Also multiple html files make the project more complex. It would be better to have a preprocessor (like in C or other languages) to mark an area in the html template to be used if a compiler flag was set or some environment variable was set. One html template can contain html code for several different CSS/HTML Libraries.\r\n\r\nWhy a preprocessor step? I can also achieve the same by setting a global variable and some *ngIf statements in the html. But those logic + additional html for all CSS/HTML Libraries will be stored in the final product and generates an unnecessary overhead.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroducing variables which are considered at compile time, to include / not include parts of the html template. Those variables must be global or can be configured in the angular.json as an option like:\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap4\"}\r\n\r\nin another project\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap5\"}\r\n\r\nand used in the html template (example can be different)\r\n\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap4>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 4 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap5>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 5 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEnhance the optimizier, to remove parts of the html which are not used at all. For example, a const global variable which will never change and set to value like \"bootstrap4\" / \"bootstrap5\" must be considered.\r\n\r\nIssues / Problems: Global variables can't be used in html templates and must be re-defined in components. The variable in the component is not a global variable anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27134","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for multiple CSS Frameworks / Partial Build depends on Environment Variables\" (#27134)"},{"Id":"2138589816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T13:04:39","Actor":"gingters","Number":"27119","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve / ng build does not work on Windows dev drive mounted as a volume","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI'm on Windows 11, using a [dev drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/) ( `D:` ).

It can run the build step before jest runs. This allows us to run  `jest --runInBand` ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to add a `--runInBand` ng test flag for jest.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've currently invented a workaround. Unfortunately, without a proper `ng test --build` command, I had to revert to `ng test || exit 0`. This will build _and run the tests once_ before debugging can start. The necessary `sourceMapPathOverrides` are hideous as well 🙈\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>launch.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ng test (jest)\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm: test:build\",\r\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n        \"--experimental-vm-modules\",\r\n        \"./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js\",\r\n        \"--runInBand\",\r\n        \"--rootDir\",\r\n        \"${workspaceFolder}/dist/test-out/browser\",\r\n        \"--testMatch\",\r\n        \"**/?(*.)+(spec|test).mjs\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\r\n        \"src/app/*\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src/app/*\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"outputCapture\": \"std\",\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.mjs\"]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>package.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"test:build\": \"npm test || exit 0\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</summary>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to debug jest tests?\" (#27117)"},{"Id":"2138549250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T12:41:15","Actor":"sod","Number":"27116","RawContent":null,"Title":"`externalPackagesPlugin` slows down `ng serve` substantially","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] Kinda, as the `externalPackagesPlugin` was just added via https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923 existed, which was part of [17.1.1](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.1), so I guess angular [17.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.0)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nangular 17.2.0\r\nvite/esbuild powered application builder\r\n\r\nUsing the `loader` option in `angular.json` like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\", \".svg\": \"text\" },\r\n```\r\n\r\nto support images as ecmascript imports or svgs as inline. This causes angular-cli to add the `externalPackagesPlugin` which is a giant hit on build performance. For our apps:\r\n\r\n| angular version | watch rebuild time |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| angular 17.1.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `0.8 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.1.1 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.2.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n\r\nThose additional 5.2 seconds are also added to the initial build.\r\n\r\nMy rough idea of the issue is, that the `externalPackagesPlugin` looks at every single import that doesn't start with `.` or `/` and doesn't cache the results. So tons of `@angular/...`, `rxjs`, `@ngrx/...` and similar imports are resolved over and over again. Even if this function only needs 2ms to run, this quickly adds up.\r\n\r\n### Minimal

[`v0.20.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0201)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1)\n\n-   Fix a bug with the CSS nesting transform ([#&#8203;3648](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3648))\n\n    This release fixes a bug with the CSS nesting transform for older browsers where the generated CSS could be incorrect if a selector list contained a pseudo element followed by another selector. The bug was caused by incorrectly mutating the parent rule's selector list when filtering out pseudo elements for the child rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      &:after,\n      & .bar {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo .bar,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo:after,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Constant folding for JavaScript inequality operators ([#&#8203;3645](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3645))\n\n    This release introduces constant folding for the `< > <= >=` operators. The minifier will now replace these operators with `true` or `false` when both sides are compile-time numeric or string constants:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(1 < 2, '🍕' > '🧀')\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(1<2,\"🍕\">\"🧀\");\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(!0,!1);\n    ```\n\n-   Better handling of `__proto__` edge cases ([#&#8203;3651](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3651))\n\n    JavaScript object literal syntax contains a special case where a non-computed property with a key of `__proto__` sets the prototype of the object. This does not apply to computed properties or to properties that use the shorthand property syntax introduced in ES6. Previously esbuild didn't correctly preserve the \"sets the prototype\" status of properties inside an object literal, meaning a property that sets the prototype could accidentally be transformed into one that doesn't and vice versa. This has now been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ } // Note: sets the prototype\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__ = proto\n        return { __proto__ } // Note: doesn't set the prototype\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__ }; // Note: no longer sets the prototype (WRONG)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { __proto__: __proto__2 }; // Note: now sets the prototype (WRONG)\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ }; // Note: sets the prototype (correct)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { [\"__proto__\"]: __proto__2 }; // Note: doesn't set the prototype (correct)\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix cross-platform non-determinism with CSS color space transformations ([#&#8203;3650](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3650))\n\n    The Go compiler takes advantage of \"fused multiply and add\" (FMA) instructions on certain processors which do the operation `x*y + z` without intermediate rounding. This causes esbuild's CSS color space math to differ on different processors (currently `ppc64le` and `s390x`), which breaks esbuild's guarantee of deterministic output. To avoid this, esbuild's color space math now inserts a `float64()` cast around every single math operation. This tells the Go compiler not to use the FMA optimization.\n\n-   Fix a crash when resolving a path from a directory that doesn't exist ([#&#8203;3634](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3634))\n\n    This release fixes a regression where esbuild could crash when resolving an absolute path if the source directory for the path resolution operation doesn't exist. While this situation doesn't normally come up, it could come up when running esbuild concurrently with another operation that mutates the file system as esbuild is doing a build (such as using `git` to switch branches). The underlying problem was a regression that was introduced in version 0.18.0.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents (https-proxy-agent)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.4`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#704)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@7.0.3...https-proxy-agent@7.0.4)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   [`b88ab46`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/b88ab46): Import `url` instead of `node:url` 🤷‍♂️\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.15`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>piscinajs/piscina (piscina)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.2`](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#432-2024-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.2)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.12.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.11.0...v4.12.0)\n\n*2024-02-16*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Improve raw bundling performance by 10-15% when not using the cache or plugins that return an AST ([#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5391))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5391): Improve performance by directly constructing AST from buffer ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5393](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5393): chore(deps): update dependency eslint-plugin-unicorn to v51 ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5394](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5394): chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v7 (major) ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5395](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5395): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.71.1`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1711)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.71.0...1.71.1)\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Ship the musl Linux release with the proper Dart executable.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Export the `NodePackageImporter` class in ESM mode.\n\n-   Allow `NodePackageImporter` to locate a default directory even when the\n    entrypoint is an ESM module.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Make passing a null argument to `NodePackageImporter()` a static error rather\n    than just a runtime error.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   In the JS Embedded Host, properly install the musl Linux embedded compiler\n    when running on musl Linux.\n\n### [`v1.71.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1710)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.70.0...1.71.0)\n\nFor more information about `pkg:` importers, see [the\nannouncement][pkg-importers] on the Sass blog.\n\n[pkg-importers]: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-pkg-importers\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Add a `--pkg-importer` flag to enable built-in `pkg:` importers.

It appears to be a deliberate design choice, as Material 3 themes exclusively generate CSS custom variables.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we have two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. **SCSS Mixin Approach:**\r\n   Add an SCSS mixin that generates all `mat-elevation-z*` classes from 0 to 24, applying the necessary `box-shadow` rules. Here's an example of the mixin:\r\n   ```scss\r\n   @mixin elevations() {\r\n     @for $elevation from 0 to 24 {\r\n       .mat-elevation-z#{$elevation} {\r\n         @include mat.elevation($elevation);\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Directive Update Approach:**\r\n   Remove the usage of `mat-elevation-z*` classes in all directives (e.g., `mat-menu`), replacing them with the `box-shadow` CSS rule. Utilize a CSS custom property for flexibility, such as:\r\n   ```css\r\n   var(--mat-elevation-shadow-z8) or var(--mat-menu-shadow)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nAdditional Suggestion:\r\nIntroduce a theme API, `mat.get-shadow`, which returns the `box-shadow` for a given elevation value. This API would function similarly to the existing `mat.elevation(x)` mixin but solely returns the value without applying it.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements aim to provide flexibility and address the missing `box-shadow` rule in a manner consistent with the Material 3 design choices.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-n9d5rj\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

As you are aware, Material 3 for the web heavily relies on CSS custom properties, and this adjustment would be more in line with the framework's theming approach.\r\n\r\nThe suggested change aligns with Material 3's philosophy of emitting only CSS custom property declarations, avoiding standard CSS properties (refer to https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#applying-your-theme). Importantly, this approach remains fully compatible with the current Material 2 themes implementation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, incorporating CSS custom properties will streamline the organization of CSS rules by allowing them to be centralized directly in the component's stylesheet. This centralization mitigates the challenges associated with splitting rules across multiple files, resulting in a more manageable and less error-prone maintenance process. It is worth noting that this approach enhances component autonomy, making theming optional, as custom properties can be set outside of a theme. This flexibility ensures a smoother development and maintenance experience.\r\n\r\nImplementing this proposal would greatly assist developers in their future migration from Material 2 to 3, requiring only changes to flat custom properties isolated in mixins. Additionally, it opens the door to granular customizations with CSS custom properties (see https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#granular-customizations-with-css-custom-properties) even before material 3 integration becomes stable. Embracing CSS custom properties aligns with modern best practices and ensures future-proofing.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this proposal.\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// carousel.scss\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  color: var(--app-carousel-color);\r\n  font-family: var(--app-carousel-font-family);\r\n  padding: var(--app-carousel-padding);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: var(--app-carousel-shape, 4px);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-color: #{mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-font-family: #{mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin density($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-padding: #{48px + (2px * mat.get-theme-density($theme))};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28612","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Change components theming guide to encourage css custom properties\" (#28612)"},{"Id":"2141888232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T09:46:14","Actor":"landoephan","Number":"28611","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): programmatically focused link gets focused, but the style doesn't apply","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to focus a link programmatically.

Specifically, using a fixed width or setting it to 100% results in unexpected behavior. When setting the width to 100%, the dialog is pushed to the left instead of occupying the entire viewport width. This inconsistency in behavior hampers the intended layout and user experience.

When setting the width of the dialog element using a fixed value, the dialog may render with the specified width, but it might not align properly within the viewport or may not respect the specified width, leading to unexpected layout issues.\r\n2. When setting the width of the dialog element to 100%, it may not occupy the entire width of the viewport as intended. Instead, it might get pushed to the left side of the screen, causing it to appear off-center or misaligned.\r\n3. The responsiveness of the dialog may be compromised, with the width not adjusting appropriately based on the viewport size, leading to inconsistent presentation across different devices or screen sizes.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 17.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrinr\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macos\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"m3 Issue with Dialog Width Property\" (#28604)"},{"Id":"2139938476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-17T10:38:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28603","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/expansion): center indicator icon in M3","State":"open","Body":"Currently the expansion panel arrow is drawn with borders which makes it difficult to center.

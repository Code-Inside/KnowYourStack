UI interaction (focus/blur)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nI really appreciate the work and effort that goes into maintaining and evolving the framework — thank you for all the hard work.\n\nIn the current reactive model, form-related signals react to any interaction, not just real value changes.\nFocus, blur, and touched state trigger the same reactions as actual data mutation, which makes common\nuser-editing scenarios difficult to implement cleanly.\n\n### Minimal example with explanations\n\n```ts\nimport { Component, effect, input, output, signal } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Field, form } from '@angular/forms/signals';\n\ntype User = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n};\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'user-editor',\n  imports: [Field],\n  template: `\n    <input placeholder=\"Name\" [field]=\"form.name\" />\n    <input placeholder=\"Email\" [field]=\"form.email\" />\n  `,\n})\nexport class UserEditor {\n  // Selected user (clicked from a list)\n  readonly user = input.required<User>();\n\n  // Emits when user data \"changes\"\n  readonly userChanged = output<Partial<User>>();\n\n  // Form model\n  readonly model = signal({ name: '', email: '' });\n  readonly form = form(this.model);\n\n  // WORKAROUNDS STATE\n  private currentUserId = ''; // patch guard\n  private first = true; // change guard\n\n  constructor() {\n    effect(() => {\n      const user = this.user();\n\n      /**\n       * Problem #1:\n       * Patching the form with incoming user data\n       * triggers form reactions.\n       *\n       * There is no way to silence this update\n       * (no equivalent to Reactive Forms `emitEvent: false`).\n       */\n\n      // Workaround: guard by user id\n      if (this.currentUserId === user.id) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      this.currentUserId = user.id;\n      this.first = true; // reset change guard\n\n      // ❌ Triggers form effects even though user did not edit anything\n      this.model.set({\n        name: user.name,\n        email: user.email,\n      });\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Problem #2:\n     * This effect runs on focus / blur / touched,\n     * not only on real value mutation.\n     */\n    effect(() => {\n      const form = this.form();\n      const value = form.value();\n\n      // Skip first execution (initial set / user switch)\n      if (this.first) {\n        this.first = false;\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (form.invalid()) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // ❌ Emits even when no value changed\n      this.userChanged.emit(value);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide a way to react **only to real value changes**, excluding UI interaction\n(focus / blur / touched) and silent patching of values.\n\n```ts\n// Silence form updates when patching incoming data\nform.patch(user, { emit: false });\n\n// Subscribe only to value mutation\nform.valueChanges({ only: 'value' });\n\n// Effect that reacts only to value changes\neffectOnValue(form, value => {\n  userChanged.emit(value);\n});\n````\n\n**Goal**\n\n* Separate UI interaction from data mutation\n* Remove the need for `first` flags and identity guards\n* Make user-editing scenarios predictable and safe\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- **Manual deep-compare of `form.value()`**\n  - Requires storing previous snapshots\n  - Expensive and error-prone\n  - Defeats the purpose of signal-based forms\n\n- **Boolean guards (`first`, `initialized`)**\n  - Must be reset on every patch\n  - Easy to forget during refactors\n  - Tightly couples UI flow to form logic\n\n- **Identity guards (`currentUserId`)**\n  - Leaks navigation/state logic into form code\n  - Breaks when the same entity is reloaded with new data\n\n- **Debouncing effects**\n  - Still reacts to focus / blur\n  - Only hides the problem, does not solve it\n\nAll alternatives are brittle and add complexity to a common user-editing use case.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66211","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal Forms cannot distinguish value changes from UI interaction (focus/blur)\"

version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI was doing something silly and accidentally pointed to my components TypeScript file instead of its CSS file.\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [RouterOutlet],\n  templateUrl: './app.html',\n  styleUrl: './app.ts'\n})\n```\n\nAnd I got a bunch of TypeScript compilation errors to do with rxjs:\n```\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"./internal/operators/skipUntil\" [plugin angular-compiler]\n\n    node_modules/rxjs/dist/esm5/index.js:140:26:\n      140 │ export { skipUntil } from

startWith } from './internal/operators/startWith';\n```\n\nI think this error message is confusing (and because I had a large diff at this point it took me a long time to figure out what I'd done wrong).\n\nCan we not assert the file extension is what is expected for URL properties in a component decorator and give a better error message?\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nPoint a components

Generation","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, when creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI (ng new), the CLI generates a fixed default folder structure. While this structure works well for simple applications, most real-world and enterprise Angular projects require a custom architecture from the beginning.\n\nIn practice, developers and teams often need to manually restructure the generated project to follow their preferred architecture, such as separating folders for auth, features, shared, and core. This manual setup process is repetitive, time-consuming, and can lead to inconsistencies across projects and teams.\n\nI would like to propose a feature (or supporting tool) that allows developers to define their Angular project architecture before project generation.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide a simple and interactive way to generate an Angular project with a custom structure instead of the default Angular CLI layout.\n\nThe proposed flow would be:\n\nAsk the developer which Angular version they want to use when creating the project\n\nAsk whether the project should be module-based or standalone (component-based)\n\nAllow the developer to define their own main folder structure\n\nFor example, a developer may want the following top-level folders:\n\ncore\n\nshared\n\nfeatures\n\nlayout\n\nThe developer should be able to fully manage and customize these folders, including creating subfolders inside them based on project needs.\n\nAfter defining the configuration and folder structure, the tool should generate the Angular project automatically. When the developer runs a single command or clicks a generate button, the Angular project should be created according to the selected version, architecture type, and custom folder structure.\n\nThis approach would give developers full flexibility, reduce manual setup work, and help maintain a consistent project architecture from the beginning.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32187","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Custom Angular Project Structure Generation\" (#32187)"},{"Id":"3748751174","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T20:24:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32184","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: migrate build and misc E2E tests to Puppeteer","State":"open","Body":"Replaces the Protractor-based `ng e2e` execution with the new Puppeteer `executeBrowserTest` utility in various build and misc E2E tests.\r\n\r\nThe following tests were updated:\r\n- express-engine-csp-nonce\r\n- express-engine-ngmodule\r\n- express-engine-standalone\r\n- app-shell-with-service-worker\r\n- auto-csp\r\n- worker\r\n- trusted-types\r\n\r\nThis migration involves implementing custom `checkFn` logic to replicate the assertions previously handled by Protractor, such as verifying server-rendered content, console logs, and service worker states.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32184","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: migrate build and misc E2E tests to Puppeteer\" (#32184)"},{"Id":"3746797031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T17:27:57","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32177","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch Node.js toolchain to derive version from .nvmrc.","State":"closed","Body":"Remove hardcoded node.js version\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32177","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: switch Node.js toolchain to derive version from .nvmrc.\" (#32177)"},{"Id":"3748238521","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T17:23:55","Actor":"Andreas02-dev","Number":"32182","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vitest integration lacks programmatic API for IDEs and advanced tooling","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nAngular CLI’s current Vitest integration does not expose a supported programmatic integration surface for external tooling.\n\nFor advanced tooling such as mutation testing (StrykerJS) and IDE integrations, two capabilities are required, both of which are currently blocked:\n\n1. The ability to override or extend the Vitest configuration at runtime.  \n   This is needed to run Vitest in a mutation-testing mode, for example to change includes/excludes, disable threading, adjust environments, add setup files, or tweak dependency handling.\n\n2. Access to the Vitest instance itself, so external tools can use Vitest APIs such as the `provide` API for mutant switching (injecting or replacing values during test execution).  \n   Vitest `provide` API documentation: https://main.vitest.dev/api/advanced/vitest.html#provide\n\nAt the moment, Angular CLI fully encapsulates Vitest creation and configuration. As a result, external tools cannot integrate without re-implementing Angular CLI internals.\n\nThis issue is not limited to StrykerJS. Other tools in the ecosystem are running into the same limitation:\n\n- The Vitest VS Code extension cannot detect or execute tests in Angular projects using the CLI Vitest setup:  \n  https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/686\n- IDE and external tooling compatibility issues around Vitest are already being tracked by the Angular CLI team:  \n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31734\n\nWe’d also like to thank the Angular team for the long-standing collaboration with the tooling ecosystem, and with StrykerJS in particular. Changes in Angular CLI over the years made it possible for tools like StrykerJS to support Angular with Karma reliably for a long time, and we really appreciate that effort. We hope we can work something out together again so the new Vitest-based architecture remains just as extensible and ecosystem-friendly.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe would like Angular CLI to expose a stable, supported API for its Vitest integration that external tools can build upon.\n\nConcretely, this would include:\n\n1. Runtime Vitest config overrides before instance creation  \n   External tooling should be able to provide or merge Vitest configuration before the Vitest instance is created. This is required for use cases like mutation testing, where tools need to adjust runner-level behavior such as threading, test selection, setup files, or environment options.\n\n2. Access to the actual Vitest instance  \n   External tools need access to the real Vitest instance so they can:\n   - Use the Vitest `provide` API for mutant switching and other runtime injections\n   - Control test execution (for example related tests, name pattern filtering, or repeated runs)\n   - Reset or manage internal state between runs in a supported way\n\n3. An exported helper function, for example `buildAndCreateVitest(...)`\n\n   This helper would:\n   - Perform the Angular build\n   - Load the compiled files into memory\n   - Create and return the configured Vitest instance\n\n   It should also:\n   - Allow pre-create Vitest config overrides\n   - Work when invoked from an external tool’s execution context (such as a sandbox directory with modified or mutated files)\n   - Return the underlying, mutable Vitest instance, not just a “run tests” abstraction\n\n   Tools like StrykerJS could then call this function from their Vitest test runner instead of duplicating Angular CLI internals or relying on fragile workarounds.\n\nProviding this kind of integration point would significantly improve compatibility with IDE plugins, mutation testing tools, and other advanced testing or analysis tooling, while keeping Angular CLI as the single source of truth for how Vitest is configured and executed in Angular projects.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n- Using Analog’s Vitest integration, which exposes a more standard and tool-friendly Vitest setup:  \n  https://analogjs.org/docs/features/testing/vitest\n\n  While this can work as a workaround, it is not a good long-term solution for Angular CLI users. It requires manual configuration by the user, is not officially supported by Angular CLI, and does not provide an out-of-the-box Angular experience. As a result, tooling would only work for users who opt into a specific non-CLI setup, rather than working by default for Angular projects.\n\n- Custom scripts that build Angular separately and invoke Vitest outside Angular CLI.  \n  These approaches are brittle, bypass CLI guarantees, duplicate Angular internals, and are difficult to maintain over time.\n\nUltimately, both alternatives shift complexity to end users or tooling authors and fragment the ecosystem. A supported integration point in Angular CLI would allow tools to work out of the box for Angular projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32182","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vitest integration lacks programmatic API for IDEs and advanced tooling\" (#32182)"},{"Id":"3747863805","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T15:33:49","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32181","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: remove control characters from puppeteer serve output in E2E tests","State":"closed","Body":"Ensures that ANSI color codes do not interfere with URL matching in the Puppeteer E2E utility by using 'NO_COLOR' and removing control characters from the stdout.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32181","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: remove control characters from puppeteer serve output in E2E tests\" (#32181)"},{"Id":"3746790893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T13:56:24","Actor":"mikem-of","Number":"32176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inconsistent default templates in App component for inline template vs external template file","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen generating a new project, an App component is created with inconsistent templates, depending on whether you use internal or external templates.\n\nWhen you use `ng new -t` (inline template), the default `h1` contains `Welcome to {{ title() }}!`:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/standalone-files/src/app/app__suffix__.ts.template#L8\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/module-files/src/app/app__suffix__.ts.template#L6\n\nWhen you use `ng new` (external template file), the default `h1` contains  `Hello, {{ title() }}`:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/common-files/src/app/app__suffix__.html.template#L233\n\n\nWhen I add Cypress using `ng e2e`, it will create this default assertion: `cy.contains('app is running') `.

Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.\n\n  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.\n\n  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10265](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).\n\n- Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.\n\n  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:\n\n  ```yaml\n  allowBuilds:\n    esbuild: true\n    core-js: false\n  ```\n\n  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - esbuild\n  ignoredBuiltDependencies:\n    - core-js\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10311](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)\n\n- Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#&#8203;10301](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#&#8203;8658](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).\n- Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#&#8203;10294](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).\n- Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#&#8203;10273](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).\n- When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#&#8203;10197](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

However, when Angular's AOT compiler type-checks a template binding like `[preserveContent]=\"true\"`, it needs to import the `DeferredContentAware` type to verify the binding.\n\nThe problem is that `DeferredContentAware` is imported from an internal module:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 4)\nimport { DeferredContentAware } from '@angular/aria/_deferred-content-chunk.js';\n```\n\nThe underscore prefix (`_`) indicates this is a private/internal module, and `DeferredContentAware` is **not re-exported** from `@angular/aria/accordion`.\n\n### The Inconsistency\n\n1. `AccordionPanel` **exposes** `preserveContent` as a usable input via `hostDirectives`\n2. But the **type** required to use this input (`DeferredContentAware`) is **not exported**\n3. This works in JIT mode (development) but **fails in AOT/partial compilation** (library builds)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: Unable to reproduce in StackBlitz as this requires a library build with ng-packagr (partial compilation mode). StackBlitz runs in JIT mode where the issue doesn't manifest.\n\n1. Create an Angular library project using ng-packagr\n2. Create a component that uses `AccordionPanel` with `preserveContent` binding:\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-accordion',\n  imports: [AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent],\n  template: `\n    <div ngAccordionGroup>\n      <button ngAccordionTrigger [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\">Toggle</button>\n      <div ngAccordionPanel\n           [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\"\n           [preserveContent]=\"true\">  <!-- THIS CAUSES NG3004 -->\n        <ng-template ngAccordionContent>\n          <p>Panel content</p>\n        </ng-template>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyAccordionComponent {}\n```\n\n3. Build the library:\n```bash\nng build my-library\n# or\nnpx ng-packagr -p ng-package.json\n```\n\n4. Observe the error:\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOne of the following:\n\n### Option A: Export `DeferredContentAware` (Preferred)\n\nExport `DeferredContentAware` from `@angular/aria/accordion` so that consumers can use the `preserveContent` input that is already exposed via `hostDirectives`:\n\n```typescript\n// @angular/aria/accordion/index.ts\nexport { DeferredContentAware } from '../_deferred-content-chunk';\nexport { AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent } from './accordion';\n```\n\n### Option B: Document the limitation\n\nIf `preserveContent` is intentionally internal, remove it from the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping or document that it cannot be used in library builds.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The `preserveContent` input appears to be available (TypeScript/IDE shows it as a valid input)\n- Development mode (JIT) works fine\n- Library builds (AOT partial compilation) fail with `NG3004`\n- There is no workaround - attribute binding `[attr.preserveContent]=\"true\"` bypasses the error but doesn't actually set the signal input value\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 21.0.4\nNode: 24.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.6.2\nOS: win32 arm64\n\nAngular: 21.0.6\n@angular/aria: 21.0.5\n@angular/cdk: 21.0.5\n\nBrowser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari (not browser-specific)\nOperating System: Windows 11 ARM64 (also reproducible on other platforms)\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Why `preserveContent` is needed\n\nWithout `preserveContent=true`, there can be content duplication issues when combining:\n- `ngAccordionContent` (deferred content)\n- `NgTemplateOutlet` (for user-provided content templates)\n- Native Angular animations (`animate.enter`/`animate.leave`)\n\nWhen the panel visibility changes, the deferred content system destroys/recreates views, which can conflict with animation lifecycle and `NgTemplateOutlet`, resulting in duplicate content appearing in the DOM.\n\n### Current Workaround\n\nThe only workaround is to not use `preserveContent` and avoid combining deferred content with animations - but this limits the functionality that Angular ARIA accordion can provide.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32590","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(aria/accordion): `preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds\" (#32590)"},{"Id":"3757675368","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-23T15:08:31","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"32589","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(devinfra): Get rid of max-line-length stylelint","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nNow that Sass files are autoformatted by a formatter that does not respect line length limits and automatically defeats attempts to manually conform with them, this check serves no purpose other than to force us to add disablings for it.

`blockExoticSubdeps` that prevents the resolution of exotic protocols in transitive dependencies.\n\n  When set to `true`, direct dependencies (those listed in your root `package.json`) may still use exotic sources, but all transitive dependencies must be resolved from a trusted source. Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.\n\n  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.\n\n  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10265](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).\n\n- Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.\n\n  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:\n\n  ```yaml\n  allowBuilds:\n    esbuild: true\n    core-js: false\n  ```\n\n  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - esbuild\n  ignoredBuiltDependencies:\n    - core-js\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10311](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)\n\n- Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#&#8203;10301](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#&#8203;8658](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).\n- Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#&#8203;10294](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).\n- Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#&#8203;10273](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).\n- When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#&#8203;10197](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.25.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.25.0): pnpm 10.25\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.24.0...v10.25.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Allow loading certificates from `cert`, `ca`, and `key` for specific registry URLs.

Breaking Changes (affecting only experimental features)\n\n##### forms\n\n- The shape of `SignalFormsConfig.classes` has changed\n\n  Previously each function in the `classes` map took a `FieldState`. Now\n  it takes a `Field` directive.\n\n  For example if you previously had:\n\n  ```\n  provideSignalFormsConfig({\n    classes: {\n      'my-valid': (state) => state.valid()\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  You would need to update to:\n\n  ```\n  provideSignalFormsConfig({\n    classes: {\n      'my-valid': ({state}) => state().valid()\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  (cherry picked from commit [`348f149`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/348f149e8b06d6885f54bac4cf03a9481a8b19b7))\n- (cherry picked from commit [`ae0c590`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ae0c59028a2f393ea5716bf222db2c38e7a3989f))\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [4c8fb3631d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/4c8fb3631d58e22d693aba0b89243f2e9ecb0807) | fix  | throw better errors for potential circular references  |\n| [48492524ea](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/48492524ea4adfa232b0daee0d955924be31ebea) | fix  | use mutable ResponseInit type for RESPONSE\\_INIT token |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [81772b420d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/81772b420dcda2cbe2a8cb75e50c6da2e1ecdc68) | feat     | pass field directive to class config                          |\n| [729b96476b](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/729b96476b73f1670a0f7c6ab3f36be9d38ebcac) | refactor | rename field to fieldTree in FieldContext and ValidationError |\n\n##### language-service\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [e0694df3ec](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e0694df3eccae3d31a4ea537dffe1db1368ef34a) | fix  | avoid interpolation highlighting inside [@&#8203;let](https://redirect.github.com/let) |\n| [5047be4bc1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/5047be4bc1c6f6016263703c743f8033f669f0ee) | fix  | Prevent language service from crashing on suggestion diagnostic errors |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi41OC4xIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuNTguMSIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6IjIxLjAueCIsImxhYmVscyI6WyJhY3Rpb246IG1lcmdlIiwiYXJlYTogYnVpbGQgJiBjaSIsInRhcmdldDogYXV0b21hdGlvbiJdfQ==-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32563","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.0.x)\" (#32563)"},{"Id":"3739019721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-17T21:29:56","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32562","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: migrate Bazel ignore rules from .bazelignore to REPO.bazel","State":"closed","Body":"See: https://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/repo and https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/092dd7892b816f899c7ab5b794fdb6236abb6939/docs/pnpm.md?plain=1#L77","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32562","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: migrate Bazel ignore rules from .bazelignore to REPO.bazel\" (#32562)"},{"Id":"3738975991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-17T13:58:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32561","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): type issues when importing Aria directives","State":"closed","Body":"Similar fix to #32522 that aims to capture the remaining host directives.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66069.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): type issues when importing Aria directives\" (#32561)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-12-24T03:30:02.4475846Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1711}

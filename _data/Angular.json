We correct them.\r\n\r\n1. Autocompletions immediately after `@` were usually not working, for example `foo @|`. We fix this by causing the lexer to not consider the `@` part of the text node.\r\n2. Autocompletions such as `@\\nfoo`, where a newline follows a bare `@`, were not working because the language service visitor considered us inside the subsequent text node. We fix this by adding a block name span for the block keyword, and special-case whether we are completing inside the name span. If we are, we don't continue to the following text node.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52198","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(language-service): Autocomplete block keywords in more cases\" (#52198)"},{"Id":"1940855185","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-12T21:57:06","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"52197","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: mark hydration and fetch APIs as stable","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains a few commits that remove `@developerPreview` from several APIs related to hydration and fetch support in HttpClient.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52197","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: mark hydration and fetch APIs as stable\" (#52197)"},{"Id":"1940831736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-12T21:42:05","Actor":"Jefftopia","Number":"52196","RawContent":null,"Title":"Extend defer's error statement to include `when` semantics","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nv17+\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrent defer semantics permit component loading based on conditions set in `when` which include state bound to the component, as described in the RFC [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/50716#discussioncomment-6200144). \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n      {{ whenSuccess().foo }}\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App implements OnInit {\r\n  whenSuccess = signal<any>(undefined);\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      this.whenSuccess.set({ foo: 'a', bar: 'b' });\r\n    }, 3_000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two shortcomings of the existing implementation from a devex perspective:\r\n\r\n1. The responsibility of displaying error state requires leaning on additional control-flow syntax within the template.\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n      @if (!whenSuccess().error) {\r\n        <div>\r\n          Success\r\n        </div>\r\n      } @else {\r\n        <div>An error occured</div>\r\n      }\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error {\r\n      <div>Failed to load the defered js</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `} error {}` is not intuitive; `error` should simply allow for user-defined error-states in addition to failing to fetch scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nProposed solution is to allow the error statement to utilize `when` similar to `defer`'s `when` statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error (whenSuccess().error) {\r\n      <div>{{ whenSuccess().error }}</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution to use `@if {} @else {}` is explored above.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52196","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extend defer's error statement to include `when` semantics\" (#52196)"},{"Id":"1940754576","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-12T20:35:23","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"52195","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixes for i18n block behavior in template pipeline","State":"open","Body":"With these fixes most of the tests related to i18n for different nested element structures are now passing.

As is the case for the existing builder JavaScript exports from the package, the new export (`buildApplication`) is also considered experimental and does not provide the support nor semver guarantees that the builders have when used via `angular.json` configuration. The usage of the `plugins` parameter of the `buildApplication` allows adding esbuild compatible plugins to the end of the plugin list for the main application code bundling. However, usage of the parameter may result in unexpected application output and/or build failures.

This was introduced in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25843\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `_isAnimating` property and the `_animationDone` subject are both not exposed through public API so we cannot wait for the animation to be finished to close the picker. However, exposing it would be not a good solution as this would require us to have knowledge of the internals of the component to implement the solution.

Especially while headaching your way through upgrade from version 14 to 16.\r\n\r\nAlso a way to select a different version by opening it in a separate tab (like a link via mousewheel button) would be really, I mean really useful. That way you can see the difference even better and basically compare things side by side.\r\n\r\nThe solution might also be to put a version select inside of the component page, but again it would have much more value if I could open another version in a new tab.\r\n\r\nLet's make the documentation of the component library that represents very good UI/UX design as easy to use and as user-friendly as the design itself.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27912","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(website): Changing the version in the website's header should redirect to the page you were on\" (#27912)"},{"Id":"1929849390","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T10:15:24","Actor":"magentaRE","Number":"27911","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(sidenav/drawer/focustrap): NVDA announces \"blank\" when interacting with focus trap","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nlegacy non MDC-based components\n\n### Description\n\n`mat-sidenav` generates two `<div>` elements that have tabindex set to 0, **even if the sidenav is closed**. This happens in `mode=\"over\"` of sidenav:\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"cdk-visually-hidden cdk-focus-trap-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\"></div>`\r\n\r\nAlthough they have `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, they can be tabbed into which creates **major** accessibility issue for keyboard users. In previous versions of sidenav, the `tabindex=\"0\"` was only added **after** the sidenav was opened and it was **removed** when user closed the sidenav. User can tab onto those 2 `div`s (with the sidenav closed). That creates 2 invisible elements which can confuse user while navigating through the website.\r\n\r\nThis issue is basically same as #27623, but in that issue, the concern was that Axe core found 2 issues, which is different to this issue. This issue is concerned about tabbing onto \"invisible\" elements. IMO, this is a regression bug and adding `tabindex=\"0\"` should be done only when the sidenav is opened. Also, will #27629 fix this issue as well?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/rwjkdz-juypse?file=src%2Fexample%2Fsidenav-autosize-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open any `mat-sidenav` example with the `mode=\"over\"` in the new MDC components.\r\n2. Use keyboard to navigate through the page.\r\n3. User tabs onto 2 invisible elements created by the sidenav (with sidenav being closed)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are no elements that can be tabbed onto created by sidenav when the sidenav is closed.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere are 2 `<div>` elements (used for creating focus trap) encapsulating sidenav that can be tabbed onto created by sidenav (with the sidenav closed).\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27911","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(sidenav/drawer/focustrap): NVDA announces \"blank\" when interacting with focus trap\" (#27911)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-10-13T03:30:03.9213732Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2073}

( :let | :as | :keyExp )*\"\r\n    keyExp = :key \":\"? :expression (\"as\" :local)? \";\"?\r\n    let = \"let\" :local \"=\" :export \";\"?\r\n    as = :export \"as\" :local \";\"?\r\n\r\nI describe several issues of the used notation and grammar rules. Each issue and my suggested solution is described in a section. The sections are separated by a horizontal line in the following. The presented solutions build on the (changes of the) previous solutions. The last section shows the final result (production rules).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Production rule `*:prefix` is not formatted consistently.\r\n**Solution:** Use one space character before and after `=`. Use one space character before `(` and no space character after `(`. Use no space character before `)`. Use one space character after `)` if it is not followed by an operator (`?` or `*`). Otherwise, only write one space character after the operator, but only if the operator is not followed by `)`.\r\n\r\n    *:prefix = \" (:let | :expression) (';' | ',')? (:let | :as | :keyExp)* \"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Prefix `:` of nonterminal symbols creates no added value.\r\n**Solution:** Remove `:`\r\n\r\n    *prefix = \" (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* \"\r\n    keyExp = key \":\"? expression (\"as\" local)? \";\"?\r\n    let = \"let\" local \"=\" export \";\"?\r\n    as = export \"as\" local \";\"?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** No consistent use of double quotation marks `\"` in the production rules. `\"` is used as terminal symbol in production rule `*prefix`, but as delimiter of string literals (sequence of terminal symbols) in the other production rules `keyExp`, `let` and `as`.\r\n**Solution:** Use `'` as delimiter and surround the double quotation terminal symbol with delimiters:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? ';'?\r\n    let = 'let' local '=' export ';'?\r\n    as = export 'as' local ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Assignment of `export` to `local` variable is mandatory in production rule `let`, but the implementation allows to omit explicit assignment, like `let x` in\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let x of ['a', 'b']\">{{x}}</p>\r\n\r\nwhich is treated like an implicit assignment of the special context property `$implicit` to `x`.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Make assignment optional in production rule `let`:\r\n\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)? ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** The current grammar definition allows the production of two consecutive semicolons, see derivation example:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"' (let             )  ';'         (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"' ('let' local ('=' export)? ';'?) ';' (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"'  'let' local  '=' export   ';'   ';' (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n\r\nBut the current implementation throws `Template parse errors` in that case, for example:\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let i = index;; let x of ['a', 'b']\">{{i}}: {{x}}</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Extract semicolon production from rule `let` into rule `*prefix` and move separator production `(';' | ',')?` to the alternative `expression`:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let ';'? | expression (';' | ',')?) (let ';'? | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? ';'?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Production rules do not consider that (terminal symbol) colon may be used instead of semicolon separator. For example\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let item of [1,2,3] as items; trackBy: myTrack, index as i\">{{i}}: {{item}}</p>\r\n\r\ncan not be produced using the current rules due to the colon after `myTrack`, but it is valid syntax in the implementation.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Define production rule `sep` (abbreviation of *separator*):\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let sep? | expression sep?) (let sep? | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    sep = ';' | ','\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? sep?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local sep?\r\n\r\nThis can be simplified by moving `sep?` around in the definitions\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) sep? ((let | as | keyExp) sep?)* '\"'\r\n    sep = ';' | ','\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local\r\n\r\nThis code block represents my **final suggestion**.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33436","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(docs-infra): fix (notation of) microsyntax grammar\" (#33436)"},{"Id":"513015240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-27T20:10:30","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"33435","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(bazel): update bazel-schematics to use Ivy and new rollup_bundle","State":"open","Body":"Note: the @angular/bazel schematic now prepends the package.json \"script\" field with `ngcc; ` if there is an existing script field.

If I do I get weird double callbacks and click actions when clicking the notification outside the app (by having a new custom service worker that imports this one and firebase's).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nHave a boolean, like { ..., disablePush: true } in ngsw-config.json for hook listeners for push messages. I think these lines below could be activated based on the aforementioned boolean.\r\n\r\n@angular/packages/service-worker/worker/src/driver.ts  line: 158\r\n```\r\n    // Handle the fetch, message, and push events.\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => this.onFetch(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('message', (event) => this.onMessage(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('push', (event) => this.onPush(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('notificationclick', (event) => this.onClick(event !));\r\n```\r\nOr maybe there should be two service workers, one with and without these listeners. But I believe it would be a more complicated solution.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nRight now you have to make a new service worker then import ngsw and then overwrite the listeners so they do what you want. But still can't use firebase's messaging service worker nor its functionality (at least I couldn't).

I was following the routing section of the tour of heroes tutorial https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt5. After defining the parameterized route for the hero details component, i noticed the details would not appear when clicking on a hero (from both the list and the dashboard). The URL displayed in the address bar was correct (i.e. /heroes/details/11), and the href attribute in the rendered html was also correct. After stepping through the debugger (in VS Code), i discovered that the parameter key in the route map was stored as \"id}\" instead of id. When i updated my code to retrieve the value passing \"id}\" as the key name, it worked as expected and the details were displayed for the selected hero. It appears as though one of the ending \"}\" chars from the binding syntax in the template is not being dropped when the key/value pair is added to the activated route's param map. This issue was found using Firefox 69.0.3 and was not tested in other browsers.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/johnluisi/angular-demo-bug\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.14\r\nNode: 12.13.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.14\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.14\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.14\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.14\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.14\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33408","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Param Map for Activated Route Contains Incorrect Param Keys\" (#33408)"},{"Id":"512719249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-25T22:18:13","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"33413","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(ivy): clean up class_binding perf tests for readability","State":"closed","Body":"New reporting format:\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmark: class binding[create]: <div class=\"A B\">\r\n styling: 287.289 ns(-44%) \r\n base: 199.771 ns(0%) \r\n\r\nBenchmark: class binding[update]: <div class=\"A B\">\r\n styling: 62.092 us(-1%) \r\n base: 61.202 us(0%) \r\n\r\nBenchmark: class binding[noop]: <div class=\"A B\">\r\n styling: 62.187 us(-2%) \r\n base: 61.100 us(0%) \r\n\r\nBenchmark: class binding[create]: <div [class]=\"toggle ?

You need to manually enable it to prove that you understand the limits of polyfill.\n\nIn previous versions you can enable Grid polyfill by `grid: 'autoplace'` option or by `/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */` control comment. But in some cases, developers were not able to use both methods. For instance, during [work with Material UI’ CSS-in-JS in Create React App](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1257).\n\nNow Autoprefixer supports environment variable to enable CSS Grid polyfill:\n\n```sh\nAUTOPREFIXER_GRID=autoplace npm build\n```\n\n#### Performance Improvements\n\n[@&#8203;Knagis](https://togithub.com/Knagis) [found](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1256) that Browserslist takes 70% of the Autoprefixer time.\n\n![Autoprefixer 9.6.5 profiling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/67489064-e0a10400-f6ab-11e9-895b-1507608e2446.png)\n\nWe did a lot of improvements in Browserslist and now Autoprefixer should work much faster.\n\n![67417985-a283e180-f5d2-11e9-879a-e364c9acccf1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/67489142-01695980-f6ac-11e9-96a2-c2cc169b6767.png)\n\n#### Other\n\n-   Fix [`Cannot read property 'grid' of undefined`](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1244) error\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Generally this works but if the browser tab crashes due to using too much memory, the page will reload but perform an initial navigation before the routes are registered, causing a white screen of death. After spending days debugging this (due to tab crashing and not being able to log anything) I've worked out that this is the ordering of events:\r\n - NavigationStart (popstate with restoredState) \r\n - NavigationError (Cannot match any routes)\r\n - Add routes and call `router.initialNavigation()`\r\n\r\nThis is how we configure the router:\r\n```ts\r\nRouterModule.forRoot([], {\r\n  initialNavigation: 'disabled',\r\n  onSameUrlNavigation: 'reload',\r\n  paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always',\r\n  scrollPositionRestoration: 'top',\r\n  relativeLinkResolution: 'corrected',\r\n}),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen comparing our site to competitors in the same industry, every other website is able to gracefully recover from a crashed tab except for ours which is the only Angular site. \r\n\r\nIf it's expected behaviour then I'm not sure how we're meant to workaround it apart from get a white screen and expect the user ot refresh.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nI've downloaded the Tour of Heroes zip, pushed it as a commit and then my reproduction on top of that here for the exact changes: https://github.com/intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug/commit/107da944332a627316fda72dfcdd7e2a02dae600#diff-2d2675bb4687601a5c7ccf707455132f90f3516a33716185687e5c41df59ac7d\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone git@github.com:intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug.git\r\ncd angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run dev:ssr --host=0.0.0.0\r\nifconfig | grep inet // grab your IP address\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen go to it on your iPhone using your IP address on the same network (if you do it on desktop, the tab doesn't really crash and restart the same).\r\n \r\nGo to heroes and click the \"Crash browser tab\" button. You'll notice that it didn't refresh on the current route and it couldn't match a route.

Description\n\nI don't know why I'm only noticing this now and not earlier after having worked with Angular for some time.\r\nMaybe it's also some configuration (strict, angular-setting) that I am doing wrong, but I think not.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the evalution of *ngIf-Directive is not synced to template code inside of that *ngIf-block.\r\nIf I have an ngIf-Directive then all the html template code inside of that if-block only gets executed when the if-statement evaluates to true. So if I check in the *ngIf-Directive a variable and the if-statement evaluates to true then it should be save to use that variable inside the *ngIf-block without checking it again (in this example with optional chaining). Don't know how to describe it more precise so I added a stackblitz demo where everything is shown and commented.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIt appears to me that Angular interprets each statement in a template file separately instead of one nested block (AST) like in every programming language. Maybe that's the reason why I have to do the null check inside that if-block again.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-hfvnpa\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nObject is possibly 'null'.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.1\r\nNode: 16.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0 \r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.1\r\n@angular/material               14.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47780","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Evalution of *ngIf-Directive is not synced to template code inside of that *ngIf-block\" (#47780)"},{"Id":"1409944380","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-14T22:48:54","Actor":"nouraellm","Number":"47778","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: highlight scripts in markdown","State":"open","Body":"This PR highlights all lines of code/cmds/error messages by specifying the used language\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

These edge cases are listed below:\n\n    ```js\n    async function test() {\n      class Foo { foo() { return this } }\n      class Bar extends Foo {\n        a = async () => super.foo``\n        b = async () => super['foo']``\n        c = async (foo) => super[foo]``\n      }\n      function foo() { return this }\n      const obj = { foo }\n      const bar = new Bar\n      console.log(\n        (await bar.a()) === bar,\n        (await bar.b()) === bar,\n        (await bar.c('foo')) === bar,\n        { foo }.foo``.foo === foo,\n        (true && obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (false || obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (null ?? obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n      )\n    }\n    test()\n    ```\n\n    Each edge case in the code above previously incorrectly printed `false` when run through esbuild with `--minify --target=es6` but now correctly prints `true`. These edge cases are unlikely to have affected real-world code.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

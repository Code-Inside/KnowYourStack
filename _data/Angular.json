Change the behavior: Adjust the existing teardown configuration to allow more flexibility in how components are destroyed before or after each test. This could involve changing the type check to accommodate more use cases.\r\n\r\n2. Add support for a destroyBeforeEach option: Introduce a new option destroyBeforeEach in the teardown configuration. This would allow explicit control over the destruction behavior, enabling developers to configure whether the component should be destroyed before each test, after each test, or not at all.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\n- Flexibility: Developers will have more control over the lifecycle of components during testing.\r\n- Maintainability: Reduces the need for hacks or workarounds, making the test configurations cleaner and more maintainable.\r\n- Improved Testing Experience: Allows for more precise setup and teardown processes, improving the reliability and efficiency of tests.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe hack we have in place works for now, but would love to see this get baked into the framework!\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.

and route hierarchy for simplicity):\r\n```\r\nRootComponent\r\n  primary outlet> someLazyRoutes => moreLazyRoutes => ListComponent => routesWithIssues\r\n  named outlet>

navigation in mat tabs","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am shipping my Angular app using Material inside an APK as a TWA. It should be compatible with Android TV so I am testing the behaviour on Chromecast 2 using the dpad controller. Only available controls are the 4 directional arrows with Back and Enter.\r\nMy first page has a mat-tab-nav-bar at the top. On page load, the Chromecast browser focuses the first element and then let the user navigate in the page only using the previously listed controls. \r\nAs mat tabs enables keyboard navigation, it is switching tabs focus with arrow keys and changing active tab with Enter. But because dpads is missing Tab key, it becomes impossible to focus out the tabs and click on next elements.\r\nWe would need a way to configure the mat tabs to focus to next elements with arrows when last element has been reached instead of looping back to the first tab. That would allow dpad to navigate to the rest of the page.\r\nAny known hack to make this work would be more than welcome!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples#tab-group-align\r\nSteps to reproduce the same behaviour in a browser:\r\n1. Use tab to enter focus on first tabs bar\r\n2. Use only arrows and Enter and try to navigate in the whole page\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to next element (like a Tab) instead of going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to previous element (like a Shift+Tab) instead of going to last tab element.\r\nThis could be done with some config maybe to stay compatible with current behaviour\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed it is going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressedit is going to last tab element.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18\r\n- CDK/Material: 18\r\n- Browser(s): Chromecast browser\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android TV\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29284","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-tab-nav-bar): Accessibility issue with dpad navigation in mat tabs\" (#29284)"},{"Id":"2363996056","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:41:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29290","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29290","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.\" (#29290)"},{"Id":"2363978014","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:32:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29289","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29289","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.4 release\" (#29289)"},{"Id":"2363975132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:29:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29288","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29288","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.4\" with changelog.\" (#29288)"},{"Id":"2363947003","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:16:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29287","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): avoid losing focus when re-rendering the current view","State":"open","Body":"When some calendar inputs change, we need to re-render the entire view (e.g. `minDate` or `dateFilter`).

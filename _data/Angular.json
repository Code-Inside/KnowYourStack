This operation is transitive, so if its producer is *also* a consumer and *its* liveness state is switched, then the change is applied recursively.\r\n\r\nNote that this only matters *if* the producer is also a consumer. However, the logic in `producerAddLiveConsumer` / `producerRemoveLiveConsumerAtIndex` coerced the producer node into a producer & consumer node, which allocated extra arrays into the node structure that are never used. This didn't affect correctness, but increased the memory usage of plain signal nodes (which are just producers, never consumers).\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the logic in those operations to simply check if a producer is also a consumer instead of coercing it into one.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56140","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): don't coerce all producers to consumers on liveness change\" (#56140)"},{"Id":"2322039670","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-28T22:51:22","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"56139","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Enable event listeners to delegate.","State":"open","Body":"This creates a new method on `Dispatcher` that allows registering event listeners that also delegate to children that may have JSAction attributes.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'm facing an issue with the template rendering inconsistently when using the `ngIf` directive. After a little research, I found that the problem was with the animation module `BrowserAnimationsModule` and the animation (transition) engine `TransitionAnimationEngine`.\r\nWhat's the point: at the component creation stage, we select the renderer that will be used for animation:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/animation_renderer.ts#L44\r\nThere are two of them: basic (`BaseAnimationRenderer`) and derivative (`AnimationRenderer`). `BaseAnimationRenderer` is used if the element does not have any animations (a regular element that does not need to be processed).\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/animation_renderer.ts#L50\r\nIt is always instantiated with an empty namespace.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/animation_renderer.ts#L58\r\n`AnimationRenderer` is created if the element has some animations. Next, all internal elements try to imitate the tree that Angular components have and reuse these namespaces. Now to the point: at the stage of unmounting an element (`TransitionAnimationEngine.removeNode`), the renderer checks whether the element has a namespace.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/transition_animation_engine.ts#L816\r\nIf it is not present, then the element is marked as ready to be deleted and deleted as soon as possible.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/transition_animation_engine.ts#L819\r\nIf there is a namespace, then checks are run for the presence of animations in this namespace and, if there are none, the element is deleted immediately.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/animation_engine_next.ts#L39\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e39c01a53f9861299f7cb5451ff9c02dae470296/packages/animations/browser/src/render/animation_renderer.ts#L39\r\nTherefore, an empty animation array provokes the renderer to create a namespace that will never have animations and delete elements as soon as we want to unmount them. It works properly and tested on the angular v16/v17.\r\nHow to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. open sandbox\r\n2. go to `app.component.ts` and comment `animations: []`\r\n3. set `debugger` in the `ngAfterViewInit`\r\n4. click `Trigger toggle` in the preview\r\nYou will see two rendered elements (`another-test` and `test`) in the same time. Now, if you uncomment `animations: []` OR delete the `BrowserAnimationsModule` everything will be fine.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

So esbuild will no longer strip them with `--target=node18.N` if `N` is 20 or greater.\n\n-   Fix `for await` transform when a label is present\n\n    This release fixes a bug where the `for await` transform, which wraps the loop in a `try` statement, previously failed to also move the loop's label into the `try` statement. This bug only affects code that uses both of these features in combination. Here's an example of some affected code:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    async function test() {\n      outer: for await (const x of [Promise.resolve([0, 1])]) {\n        for (const y of x) if (y) break outer\n        throw 'fail'\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    function test() {\n      return __async(this, null, function* () {\n        outer: try {\n          for (var iter = __forAwait([Promise.resolve([0, 1])]), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n            const x = temp.value;\n            for (const y of x) if (y) break outer;\n            throw \"fail\";\n          }\n        } catch (temp) {\n          error = [temp];\n        } finally {\n          try {\n            more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n          } finally {\n            if (error)\n              throw error[0];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    function test() {\n      return __async(this, null, function* () {\n        try {\n          outer: for (var iter = __forAwait([Promise.resolve([0, 1])]), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n            const x = temp.value;\n            for (const y of x) if (y) break outer;\n            throw \"fail\";\n          }\n        } catch (temp) {\n          error = [temp];\n        } finally {\n          try {\n            more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n          } finally {\n            if (error)\n              throw error[0];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Do additional constant folding after cross-module enum inlining ([#&#8203;3416](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3416), [#&#8203;3425](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3425))\n\n    This release adds a few more cases where esbuild does constant folding after cross-module enum inlining.\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code: enum.ts\n    export enum Platform {\n      WINDOWS = 'windows',\n      MACOS = 'macos',\n      LINUX = 'linux',\n    }\n\n    // Original code: main.ts\n    import { Platform } from './enum';\n    declare const PLATFORM: string;\n    export function logPlatform() {\n      if (PLATFORM == Platform.WINDOWS) console.log('Windows');\n      else if (PLATFORM == Platform.MACOS) console.log('macOS');\n      else if (PLATFORM == Platform.LINUX) console.log('Linux');\n      else console.log('Other');\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle '--define:PLATFORM=\"macos\"' --minify --format=esm)\n    function n(){\"windows\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"Windows\"):\"macos\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"macOS\"):\"linux\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"Linux\"):console.log(\"Other\")}export{n as logPlatform};\n\n    // New output (with --bundle '--define:PLATFORM=\"macos\"' --minify --format=esm)\n    function n(){console.log(\"macOS\")}export{n as logPlatform};\n    ```\n\n-   Pass import attributes to on-resolve plugins ([#&#8203;3384](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3384), [#&#8203;3639](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3639), [#&#8203;3646](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3646))\n\n    With this release, on-resolve plugins will now have access to the import attributes on the import via the `with` property of the arguments object. This mirrors the `with` property of the arguments object that's already passed to on-load plugins. In addition, you can now pass `with` to the `resolve()` API call which will then forward that value on to all relevant plugins. Here's an example of a plugin that can now be written:\n\n    ```js\n    const examplePlugin = {\n      name: 'Example plugin',\n      setup(build) {\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /.*/ }, args => {\n          if (args.with.type === 'external')\n            return { external: true }\n        })\n      }\n    }\n\n    require('esbuild').build({\n      stdin: {\n        contents: `\n          import foo from \"./foo\" with { type: \"external\" }\n          foo()\n        `,\n      },\n      bundle: true,\n      format: 'esm',\n      write: false,\n      plugins: [examplePlugin],\n    }).then(result => {\n      console.log(result.outputFiles[0].text)\n    })\n    ```\n\n-   Formatting support for the `@position-try` rule ([#&#8203;3773](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3773))\n\n    Chrome shipped this new CSS at-rule in version 125 as part of the [CSS anchor positioning API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api). With this release, esbuild now knows to expect a declaration list inside of the `@position-try` body block and will format it appropriately.\n\n-   Always allow internal string import and export aliases ([#&#8203;3343](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3343))\n\n    Import and export names can be string literals in ES2022+. Previously esbuild forbid any usage of these aliases when the target was below ES2022. Starting with this release, esbuild will only forbid such usage when the alias would otherwise end up in output as a string literal. String literal aliases that are only used internally in the bundle and are \"compiled away\" are no longer errors. This makes it possible to use string literal aliases with esbuild's `inject` feature even when the target is earlier than ES2022.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

These chunks are statically imported in the \"common\" chunk and required for the application to bootstrap but are downloaded separately.\r\n\r\nAs they are always downloaded, splitting them does not seems to have a benefit, when `Feature1Component` or  `Feature2Component` imports them, the request is cached and it should not make a difference if it over imports. \r\n\r\nHowever, splitting them does have a downside, it increases the load time. Even tho in this example the consequences of a couple of extra chunks is meaningless in larger apps the consequence is very real.\r\n\r\nIf the application produces 100 or 200 initial chunks this will have a significant impact on the initial load time and LCP. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40126819/d8bedc9b-be77-47fc-b9ca-702e5522c110)\r\n\r\nEven tho the a modern browser using http3 or http2 uses multiplexing it will still have an significant overhead downloading so many small chunks. We are currently calling this `the chunk gap`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40126819/6d8a96dc-9a8c-4877-a4f6-277514802047)\r\n\r\nAdditionally this issue will have a larger impact on older and slower devices. \r\n\r\n- [HTTP2 Support](https://caniuse.com/HTTP2)\r\n- [HTTP3 Support](https://caniuse.com/HTTP3)\r\n\r\nAdditional example of performance impact: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27321\r\n\r\n### Avoiding Code Splitting Shared Code\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to avoid additional chunking in some cases by using barrel files. \r\n\r\nFor example if we create a barrel file that exports both `Ui1Component` and `Ui2Component` and only import them via that barrel file we are able to force `esbuild` to place the shared code into the \"common\" chunk. \r\n\r\nSo using: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// ./ui/index.ts\r\n\r\nexport * from './ui-1.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-2.component';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build output will now be:\r\n\r\n| Initial chunk files             | Names               | \r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| chunk-YIKH6UD4.js               | -  (\"common\")  | \r\n| main-V6UA4PHT.js                | main                |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Lazy chunk files                | Names               |\r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| feature-1.component-AQEBZKLJ.js | feature-1-component |\r\n| feature-2.component-EH7EGWEP.js | feature-2-component |\r\n\r\n**Note** \r\n\r\nIn [`esbuild` architecture documentation](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) it explains that:\r\n\r\n> [code splitting](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#code-splitting) is implemented as an advanced form of tree shaking.\r\n\r\nThis means that doing so will partially optout of tree shaking.\r\n\r\nFor example if we add a `Ui3Component` and a `Feature3Component`.\r\n\r\nAnd we add the `Ui3Component` to the barrel file:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// ./ui/index.ts\r\n\r\nexport * from './ui-1.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-2.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-3.component';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `Ui3Component` is never imported anywhere it will not increase the initial bundle. \r\n\r\nHowever, if we reference the `Ui3Component` in `Feature3Component` (loading the `Feature3Component` in a lazy route), this will increase the initial bundle even if `Ui3Component` is not used in the `AppComponent`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChristopherPHolder/ng-esbuild-demo\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nShared Code Required in a root component or a root node of the node graph is bundle together.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.5        \r\nNode: 20.11.1              \r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.5\r\nng-packagr                      17.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Creating unnecessary excessive chunks\" (#27715)"},{"Id":"2315848474","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-24T17:00:51","Actor":"davidlj95","Number":"27714","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: update tsconfig template link aio->adev","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- **N/A** Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- **N/A** Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (a broken link in a generated file it's an issue)\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It would be blasting to have also a `$color-hue` to let us customize the hue. I think it would be great this could also be set more globally in theme definition to avoid setting multiple times the same value.\r\n\r\nIt worth nothing to remember that was possible to do in material 2 theming through `default`, `text`, `lighter` and `darker` special hue.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nIf you want to use bright colors (like orange) as theme primary of tertiary color you will, in fact, get out of the box darker colors (to keep orange example, you will get some brown variations) which could be not accepted by your business team (as it alter branding).\r\n\r\nThen, if you want to apply those exact colors on your primitive elements you have to override each CSS variable which is time consuming and annoying. `$color-hue` option would save a lot of time and open new way of customisation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theming): add $color-hue option to color mixin (material 3)\" (#29107)"},{"Id":"2312400826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T09:22:31","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29105","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix broken links","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes some broken links to the M2 guide.\r\n\r\nFixes #29101.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29105","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix broken links\" (#29105)"},{"Id":"2311655514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T09:14:38","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"29102","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(all): Sidebar (table of contents) is not scrollable making it hard to use","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nPage examples:\r\n- https://material.angular.io/guide/material-2-theming\r\n- https://material.angular.io/components/table/api\r\n\r\nSo, consider the page: https://material.angular.io/guide/material-2-theming\r\n\r\nIt has a lot of contents broken down into multiple sections and subsections.\r\nThe table of contents (the right rail) is long and doesn't fit into one screen.\r\n\r\nHowever, this ToC is not scrollable _independently_ on the page.

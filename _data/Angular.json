I'm honestly not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nEssentially, I would like to have the ability to take a `TemplateRef` and inject _copies_ of it into multiple template outlets. The use case that made me aware of this limitation was trying to create a `<select>`-style form control, where consumers could put any arbitrary content into an option (not just text, but icons, images, components, etc.). When an option is selected, the Select component would _re_-project that option's content into the Select's template to indicate the currently selected option.\r\n\r\nIn case that's not clear, here's a simplified/truncated version of the solution that I attempted.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-select',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div class=\"selected-value\">\r\n      <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"selectedTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"!selectedTemplate\">{{ placeholder }}</ng-container>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"options\">\r\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n    </div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class SelectComponent implements AfterContentInit {\r\n\r\n  @Input() placeholder = \"Select an option\";\r\n  @ContentChildren(OptionComponent) options: QueryList<OptionComponent>;\r\n  selectedTemplate: TemplateRef<null>;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterContentInit() {\r\n    this.options.forEach(option => {\r\n      option.selected.subscribe(() => {\r\n        this.selectedTemplate = option.contentTemplate;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-option',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"contentTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n    <ng-template #contentTemplate>\r\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class OptionComponent {\r\n\r\n  @Output() selected = new EventEmitter<void>();\r\n  @ViewChild('contentTemplate') contentTemplate: TemplateRef<null>;\r\n\r\n  @HostListener('click') onClick() {\r\n    this.selected.emit();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's an example usage that takes advantage of the template cloning:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<label for=\"status\">Task Status</label>\r\n<my-select id=\"status\" [(ngModel)]=\"statusValue\">\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Blocked\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"ban\"></my-icon> Blocked\r\n  </my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Researching\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"science\"></my-icon> Researching\r\n  </my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.InProgress\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"ellipsis\"></my-icon> In Progress\r\n  <my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Done\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"check\"></my-icon> Done\r\n  </my-option>\r\n</my-select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as intended, except it appears that the `TemplateRef` can only be embedded into one view container at any given time. So, when an option is selected, it appears in the SelectComponent's template outlet (🎉), but _disappears_ from the OptionComponent's template outlet (😭), leaving a blank spot in the options list.\r\n\r\n![TemplateRef copy attempt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13191586/87069082-984b5700-c1e4-11ea-8984-fa8d804fa7d7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be great if the sample code above just worked as expected out of the box, but I can understand if that's not feasible, or if it's undesirable for some reason I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\nI dug through some of CDK's source code, because I knew that its Drag-and-Drop feature was doing some sort of element cloning for the preview and placeholder elements, so I hoped that maybe they were making use of some Angular template/view APIs that I was unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, it looks like that feature is just using some [raw, low-level DOM manipulation](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/fb769ef421f5b73a5d88163864e89e1b834086ec/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L1316) to achieve this, which would be way overkill for my use case.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would be possible to add a `clone` method to the `TemplateRef` class, which would return a new `TemplateRef` that could be embedded into an additional template outlet without detaching the original?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf I specifically wanted to enable icons in my OptionComponent, of course I could add an `@Input() icon: IconName`, and replicate that to my SelectComponent. I could make the OptionComponent's label a simple `@Input label: string` while I'm at it, instead of fiddling with the content projection at all. But I like to keep these types of core UI components as flexible as possible for a wide variety of use cases, so that when a new use case comes up that I hadn't originally anticipated, it can be accommodated without needing to make major updates to the component or [endlessly tack on configuration options](https://youtu.be/0BikjL858OQ?t=324). If there's another alternative or workaround that I haven't thought of, I would love to hear it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37995","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[feature] Ability to clone a TemplateRef to multiple outlets at once\" (#37995)"},{"Id":"654195528","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T17:11:20","Actor":"atscott","Number":"37993","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix payload size","State":"closed","Body":"Payload size test is failing on the 10.0.x branch at the moment.\r\n\r\nhttps://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/angular/angular/18305/workflows/ac9b3755-03dc-46ea-94dd-fe1deb576721/jobs/760453/steps","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37993","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fix payload size\" (#37993)"},{"Id":"654209809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T16:55:15","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"37994","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add more owners for some categories","State":"open","Body":"* Add petebacondarwin to public-api, size-tracking, and\r\n-circular-dependencies\r\n* Add josephperrott and jelbourn to code-ownership","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37994","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: add more owners for some categories\" (#37994)"},{"Id":"654179179","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T16:06:10","Actor":"IgorMinar","Number":"37992","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update closure integration tests + add closure compatible build","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37992","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update closure integration tests + add closure compatible build\" (#37992)"},{"Id":"653435925","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T15:36:58","Actor":"antch","Number":"37981","RawContent":null,"Title":"ChangeDetectorRef `markForCheck` doesn't behave properly in Angular Elements","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/elements\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nInvoking `changeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` doesn't work properly inside of an Angular Element in some cases.\r\nThis issue surfaced when I tried to use [ng-select](https://github.com/ng-select/ng-select) within a Custom Element and noticed that external binding changes were not being propagated.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Http Client provides the return types: string, ArrayBuffer, Blob and JSON objects typed with interfaces.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider that we have an API endpoint that delivers the following JSON response and a class to manage this information:\r\n\r\n```\r\n {\r\n    \"firstName\": \"John\",\r\n    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\r\n    \"dateOfBirth\": \"2000-01-01\"\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n class Person {\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    dateOfBirth: Date;\r\n\r\n    getFullName(): string {\r\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to get a typed response, we can create the following interface and use a map to parse the response:\r\n\r\n```\r\n interface PersonJson {\r\n \tfirstName: string;\r\n\tlastName: string;\r\n\tdateOfBirth: string;\r\n }\r\n\r\n function getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    this.httpClient.get<PersonJson>('/person').pipe(map(personJson => {\r\n        const person = new Person();\r\n        person.firstName = personJson.firstName;\r\n        person.lastName = personJson.lastName;\r\n        person.dateOfBirth = new Date(personJson.dateOfBirth + ' 00:00:00');\r\n    }));\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to propose the standard of implementing the methods toJSON (standard JavaScript function) and fromJSON (static) in the Person class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n class Person {\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    dateOfBirth: Date;\r\n\r\n    static fromJSON(obj: any): Person {\r\n         const person = new Person();\r\n         person.firstName = obj.firstName;\r\n         person.lastName = obj.lastName;\r\n         person.dateOfBirth = new Date(obj.dateOfBirth + ' 00:00:00');\r\n         return person;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    toJSON(): object {\r\n        return {\r\n            ...this,\r\n            dateOfBirth: this.dateOfBirth.getFullYear().toString() + '-' +\r\n                (this.dateOfBirth.getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0') + '-' +\r\n                this.dateOfBirth.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0')\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getFullName(): string {\r\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, with no modifications in the Http Client, the last code can be shortened to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get('/person').pipe(map(Person.fromJSON));\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it could be even shorter/better if we adapt the Http Client to recognize this standard and accept as a parameter a class that implements the static method fromJSON. By doing this, the Http Client can use the fromJSON method to return parsed class objects instead of plain JSON objects. The proposed implementation results in the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get('/person', Person);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nComplementary, it is important to remark that the standard toJSON method is automatically used by the Http Client to parse Person objects to JSON objects when sending it in the body of PATCH/POST/PUT requests.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nSupport for array of objects is also added. Consider that in the above example the endpoint returns an array of Persons. In this case, it is only necessary to change the generic type of the get function to Person[]:\r\n\r\n```\r\n function getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get<Person[]>('/person', Person);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a second commit was included to fix some typos and missing punctuation.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37987","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Adapt the Http Client to return class objects\" (#37987)"},{"Id":"653727272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T03:09:06","Actor":"ivanwonder","Number":"37983","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): remove completion for string","State":"open","Body":"If the user inputs a string(e.g. `<div [ngClass]=\"'str~{cursor}'\"></div>`), the completion is useless.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It'll be great if we can directly serve the compressed files without needing a web server. (Furthermore, some cloud app platforms do not seem to provide an easy way compress files on the fly. For example, aws application load balancer (level 7) does not seem to have such a functionality. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do it.)\r\n\r\nI've been using Angular on and off for some time now. One of the recurring problems for me has been the large bundle size of angular apps. In certain situations, 700~900kb framework size (uncompressed, including angular material) is just too big, and it makes angular unusable. I've been often struggling (without much success) to fit my whole application logic into a few hundred kilobytes. (I'm only talking about the main bundle size here, excluding lazy loaded modules.)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any client side framework doing this and I haven't really tried it, but I don't see why it cannot be easily done (at least, in theory).\r\n\r\nFirst, during the build process, create compressed doppelgangers for all content files (primarily, js files). For example, for `main-abc.js`, we create `main-abc.js.gz` (or something like that).\r\n\r\nWhen an angular app requests js files from a browser, add a content encoding header (gzip or br).  Then, the compressed doppelganger is served instead of the original js file. Not sure exactly how, at this point, though.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be instead of using js, simply use js.gzip or other compressed/binary files in the framework. The app simply downloads compressed js files and uncompress them before using them. This will require some kind of bootstrap.js to be loaded first so that it can download and uncompress, say, main.js.gz, etc. Again, I'm not entirely sure what the implications of doing this is.

Then it works just fine. The problem is that this workaround must be used in every file that might end up in a worker, which is quite a bit of my code.\r\n- I also tried changing the tsconfig.worker.json to specify module: \"ESNext\" (as opposed to CommonJs, which doesn't support tree shaking of barrel). No luck. I also tried changing the tsconfig associated with the library\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18206","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular webworker fails to load if importing from barrel that contains angular component\" (#18206)"},{"Id":"653212549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T13:07:00","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18194","RawContent":null,"Title":"wip! testing karma flakes in jail","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18194","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"wip! testing karma flakes in jail\" (#18194)"},{"Id":"653282491","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T13:06:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18197","RawContent":null,"Title":"tests: move Karma re-build tests to flake jail","State":"open","Body":"Similar to browser re-builds tests, Karma rebuilds tests in test-large are flakey if not run as the first suite, with this change we get less flakes as the underlying OS is more stable.\r\n\r\nExample of successful runs:\r\nhttps://circleci.com/workflow-run/af35d602-aeb5-4635-b5c8-46c34a1f021f\r\nhttps://circleci.com/workflow-run/1fc4e074-f5a6-496b-92fe-9be7a6d5e979","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18197","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"tests: move Karma re-build tests to flake jail\" (#18197)"},{"Id":"653216716","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T11:29:11","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18195","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): don't add e2e tsconfig reference in solution tsconfig","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nSince the tsconfig for e2e’s is named tsconfig.json there is no reason why it should be included in the solutions typescript configuration file.\r\n\r\nCloses #18190","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18195","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): don't add e2e tsconfig reference in solution tsconfig\" (#18195)"},{"Id":"653173756","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T11:03:45","Actor":"Sikatrih","Number":"18192","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng lint breaks with error: \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'kind' of undefined\"","State":"closed","Body":"Angular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\nIvy Workspace: \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core         10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular          10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update           0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                         6.5.5\r\n\r\nTo reproduce please create directive without selector\r\n\r\n`\r\n@Directive()\r\nexport class SimpleDirective {\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n`\r\nThe 'directive-selector' rule threw an error in '/home/aa/work/components/src/lib/packages/inputs/base-input.ts':\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'kind' of undefined\r\n    at Object.isObjectLiteralExpression (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js:11467:21)\r\n    at SelectorValidatorWalker.validateSelector (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/@qlearsite/tslint-qlearsite/node_modules/codelyzer/selectorNameBase.js:107:17)\r\n    at SelectorValidatorWalker.validateDecorator (/home/aa/workcomponents/node_modules/@qlearsite/tslint-qlearsite/node_modules/codelyzer/selectorNameBase.js:102:18)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at SelectorValidatorWalker.visitClassDeclaration (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/@qlearsite/tslint-qlearsite/node_modules/codelyzer/selectorNameBase.js:95:45)\r\n    at SelectorValidatorWalker.SyntaxWalker.visitNode (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/tslint/lib/language/walker/syntaxWalker.js:314:22)\r\n    at /home/aa/work/components/node_modules/tslint/lib/language/walker/syntaxWalker.js:535:63\r\n    at visitNodes (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js:18954:30)\r\n    at Object.forEachChild (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js:19187:24)\r\n    at SelectorValidatorWalker.SyntaxWalker.walkChildren (/home/aa/work/components/node_modules/tslint/lib/language/walker/syntaxWalker.js:535:12)\r\n`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18192","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng lint breaks with error: \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'kind' of undefined\"\" (#18192)"},{"Id":"653042588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T09:09:23","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18189","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular packages -

probably something to do with testing or the CLI.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNot as far as I know.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when running tests using `ng test`, the compile-time error-checking applied to components appears to be significantly laxer than what happens in other CLI workflows such as `ng serve` and `ng build`.\r\n\r\nI was able to find several ways to write an Angular template incorrectly, which result in (expected) compile errors when you run `ng serve` or `ng build`, but when you run `ng test`, tests which compile these components and make assertions about the resulting DOM succeed without any problems at all.\r\n\r\nI found it very surprising that tests of this type would succeed when the components completely fail to compile in other contexts. At first I thought I must be doing something very obvious wrong, but I was able to reproduce the problem with a very simple component using the out-of-the-box configuration generated by `ng new --strict` at the latest version.\r\n\r\nI searched online, and I was surprised to be unable to find any references to this problem. I did find a couple of similar-looking issues where errors in a template did not result in the test failures one would expect, but these are for non-existent HTML elements:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36171\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36430\r\n\r\nSo either this is a different but similar-looking problem, or these previously-reported problems are broader than these existing issues suggest. I tried setting `enableIvy = false` in my repro (see below), and it made no difference, so this problem does not appear to be Ivy-specific; since the issues above do appear to be Ivy-specific, I suspect this is a different problem.\r\n\r\nEither way, such significant discrepancies between test and non-test behaviours raise concerns about the usefulness of Angular tests for ensuring the code quality of components.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created the following GitHub repository to reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/amdw/templates-test-repro\r\n\r\nThere are two branches, `master` and `nonstrict`. In both cases, `ng serve` fails with a compile error, but `ng test` succeeds, despite the fact that the tests compile the broken `MyComponent` and make assertions about the contents of its DOM.\r\n\r\nI would expect both commands to fail with a compile error - or at the very least, this behavioural discrepancy should be prominently mentioned in testing-related documentation [such as this](https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-test-scenarios), with a description of how tests can be configured to have the same compilation behaviour as these other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch just uses the default compiler settings generated by `ng new --strict`. `MyComponent` has an incorrect HTML template: `myinput` can be undefined according to the component type signature, but one of its fields is being unconditionally dereferenced. Running `ng serve` or `ng build` results in a compile error, as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in src/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:7:27 - error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever `ng test` results in 100% success, with no mention in the logs that there is any problem at all.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this might be a problem with the new-ish `strictTemplates` settings, since that is the context in which I discovered the problem (I was trying to convert an existing application to use `strictTemplates`; I got to a stage where my tests were 100% green, and thought I must be nearly done, but when I ran `ng serve` I got a flood of errors caused by type-checking failures in my HTML templates).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did a little more experimentation and found that is not the case. The `nonstrict` branch switches `strictTemplates` and `strictInjectionParameters` to `false`, and introduces another template error, referencing a component attribute which does not even exist. Once again, `ng build` and `ng serve` result in the expected failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:6:39 - error TS2339: Property 'nonexistent' does not exist on type 'MycomponentComponent'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, once again, `ng test` results in 100% success.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nN/A - the problem is that tests pass when I believe they shouldn't.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of anything.

I used cdkDragDisabled to avoid dragging it, but it's still possible to drag one of the other columns to the right position and replace it.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Angular 8 I used CdkDragDrop in my mat-table like in that example:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mat-table-columns-draggable\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nInstead of replace a column with another the dragged object can now be placed everywhere and is no longer bound to the header row.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mat-table-columns-draggable-ugdwfw\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9 - 10\r\n- CDK/Material: 9 - 10\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome/FF\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): OSX\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19924","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkDragDrop): Behaviour changed in v9+\" (#19924)"},{"Id":"654206754","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T16:49:57","Actor":"swseverance","Number":"19923","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): change `MatDateRangeInput` input validation","State":"open","Body":"* Prevent `MatStartDate._validatorOnChange()` from being called when `MatDateRangeInput`'s `minDate` input is updated with the same date.\r\n* Prevent `MatEndDate._validatorOnChange()` from being called when `MatDateRangeInput`'s `maxDate` input is updated with the same date.\r\n* Resolves #19907","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19923","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): change `MatDateRangeInput` input validation\" (#19923)"},{"Id":"654044958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T15:42:32","Actor":"shah-dhaval","Number":"19921","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(MatSelectModule): How to get event that element of options attached to dom ","State":"closed","Body":"<!--------\r\n\r\nThe Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help.

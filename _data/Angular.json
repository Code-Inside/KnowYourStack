Then it works just fine. The problem is that this workaround must be used in every file that might end up in a worker, which is quite a bit of my code.\r\n- I also tried changing the tsconfig.worker.json to specify module: \"ESNext\" (as opposed to CommonJs, which doesn't support tree shaking of barrel). No luck. I also tried changing the tsconfig associated with the library\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37974","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular webworker fails to load if importing from barrel that contains angular component\" (#37974)"},{"Id":"653088617","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T10:38:08","Actor":"michaelholzknecht","Number":"37969","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 9 PWA offline not working – Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork)","State":"closed","Body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\ni have an angular PWA and it does not start offline (http error 504):\r\n**Using Angular CLI: 9.1.9 Node: 12.16.1 Angular: 9.1.11**\r\n\r\n**ngsw/state log**\r\n\r\n```\r\nDriver state: EXISTING_CLIENTS_ONLY (Degraded due to failed initialization: Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting)\r\nError: Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting)\r\n    at PrefetchAssetGroup.<anonymous> (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:734:35)\r\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\r\n    at fulfilled (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:174:62))\r\nLatest manifest hash: 801989630e02e49f3f5e9ce3d100ed150f2f0709\r\nLast update check: 37s751u\r\n\r\n=== Version 801989630e02e49f3f5e9ce3d100ed150f2f0709 ===\r\n\r\nClients: \r\n\r\n=== Idle Task Queue ===\r\nLast update tick: 36s890u\r\nLast update run: 37s791u\r\nTask queue:\r\n\r\n\r\nDebug log:\r\n\r\n[16m47s821u] Error(Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting), Error: Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting)\r\n    at PrefetchAssetGroup.<anonymous> (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:734:35)\r\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\r\n    at fulfilled (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:174:62)) initializeFully for 801989630e02e49f3f5e9ce3d100ed150f2f0709\r\n[16m46s656u] Ignoring invalid request: 'only-if-cached' can be set only with 'same-origin' mode Driver.fetch(https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/login, cache: only-if-cached, mode: no-cors)\r\n[10m25s419u] Error(Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting), Error: Hash mismatch (cacheBustedFetchFromNetwork): https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/favicon.ico: expected 2032ed1011b75c7da384289b8a1a1efc6d106924, got 1de8e3c15ab0fe47f30cb3a83ffa2498fef4c4c4 (after cache busting)\r\n    at PrefetchAssetGroup.<anonymous> (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:734:35)\r\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\r\n    at fulfilled (https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw-worker.js:174:62)) Error occurred while updating to manifest bc2988b7a29a92d6258fabcf3a918bc5ee4d7818\r\n[1m19s499u] TypeError(Failed to fetch, TypeError: Failed to fetch) Driver.fetch(https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/)\r\n[1m14s514u] TypeError(Failed to fetch, TypeError: Failed to fetch) Driver.fetch(https://sandbox.lola-infra.at/ngsw.json?ngsw-cache-bust=0.8623419988881935)\r\n[1m14s513u] Check for update aborted.

I want to make `MyTable` component with infinity scroll. I wrap `cdk-virtual-scroll` inside my component\r\n```html\r\n@Component({ \r\nselector: 'table[my-table]',\r\ntemplate:\r\n`<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport [itemSize]=\"30\">\r\n    <ng-container *cdkVirtualFor=\"let item of _dataSource\">\r\n        <ng-template\r\n          [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"rowTemplate\"\r\n          [ngTemplateOutletContext]=\"{\r\n            $implicit: item\r\n          }\">\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>`\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it this way\r\n```html\r\n<my-table>\r\n    <ng-template #col1><td>1</td></ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template #col2><td>2</td></ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template #row><tr></tr></ng-template>\r\n</my-table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is one problem. I have several TemplateRefs `col1`, `col2`, `row`, but I need one `rowTemplate` which should be `row` with  `col1` and `col2` templates inside. There is no way to reach this in Angular. I can't merge templates as strings with HTML and I also can't extract the new `rowTemplate` from some temporary outlet.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not universal. We can add\r\n`TemplateRef.append`, `TemplateRef.prepend`, `TemplateRef.insert`, etc. methods to merge templates\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Or use something looks like React way for work with templates. Angular way is too complexive for creation components.

Click the `setValue(0)` button\r\n2. The **app** component calls  `setValue` on the FormControl with `emitEvent: false`\r\n3. The **ControlValueAccessor** `writeValue(value: string)` method is called on the custom FormField component (`my-input.component`)\r\n4. Writing the value is delegated to the **MatFormFieldControl** `value` setter\r\n5. The **MatFormFieldControl** `value` setter writes the value to the CodeMirror editor with `this._editor.setValue(value)`\r\n6. The `changes` [CodeMirror event](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#events) is triggered (it was added in `ngAfterViewInit`).\r\n7. The registered callback function is called with the updated value (`this._onChange(cm.getValue())`)\r\n8. The `valueChanges` Observable emits the updated value\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, `my-input.component` explicitly calls the registered calledback function, but I had expected the framework (Angular or Angular Material) to honor `emitEvent: false` and not emit the event.\r\n\r\nIs it the responsibility of the custom FormField implementation to implement the options object and not call the registered callback if emitEvent: false is set?\r\n\r\nI assumed that it was a contractual obligation to call the `onChange` callback if the value changes, irrespective of whether the change originated from the Forms API via `setValue` or from the user typing in CodeMirror.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nAngular: 9.1.6\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom Angular FormField emitting event when configured not to.\" (#37954)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"653664206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T23:48:35","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"18200","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/schematics): run npm install from local registry","State":"open","Body":"After a new tag is pushed, the schematic e2e test will attempt to\r\ninstall the latest version, but it incorrectly installs the version\r\nfrom the actual NPM registry instead of the local registry.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18200","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/schematics): run npm install from local registry\" (#18200)"},{"Id":"653663827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T23:47:22","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"18199","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/schematics): run npm install from local registry","State":"open","Body":"After a new tag is pushed, the schematic e2e test will attempt to\r\ninstall the latest version, but it incorrectly installs the version\r\nfrom the actual NPM registry instead of the local registry.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18199","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/schematics): run npm install from local registry\" (#18199)"},{"Id":"652870970","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T21:30:55","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"18184","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: delete scripts/release.ts","State":"closed","Body":"We used to use `scripts/release.ts` to update the monorepo.json, which\r\nused to contain the current versions of all packages within the CLI\r\nrepo.

Angular Material includes many small components, but when you use angular material you end up using many of the common components, and they add up quickly (often resulting in bigger contribution from the material than the core in the main bundle). I'm having issues with large main bundle size (excluding the lazy loaded modules) with angular material-enabled apps.\r\n\r\nIt'll be great if we can build angular material components into a separate downloadable bundle.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nSimilar to `vendor-chunk` option, maybe we can add `material-chunk` option?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nSetting `vendor-chunk` or `common-chunk` could separately build angular-material bundle.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18188","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build/bundle angular core and other vendor libraries (e.g., angular-material) separately\" (#18188)"},{"Id":"652374508","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T07:50:09","Actor":"crfrolik","Number":"18180","RawContent":null,"Title":"library upgrade didn't change tsConfig property to tsconfig.base.json","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, it only applies to v10 migration\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf you create a library using v9, and then upgrade to v10, you'll run into a problem.\r\n\r\nThe `angular.json` file post-upgrade looks like this (snippet):\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr:build\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.json\",\r\n            \"project\": \"ng-package.json\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the `tsconfig.json` file is now a \"solution-style\" config.

It'll be great if we can directly serve the compressed files without needing a web server. (Furthermore, some cloud app platforms do not seem to provide an easy way compress files on the fly. For example, aws application load balancer (level 7) does not seem to have such a functionality. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do it.)\r\n\r\nI've been using Angular on and off for some time now. One of the recurring problems for me has been the large bundle size of angular apps. In certain situations, 700~900kb framework size (uncompressed, including angular material) is just too big, and it makes angular unusable. I've been often struggling (without much success) to fit my whole application logic into a few hundred kilobytes. (I'm only talking about the main bundle size here, excluding lazy loaded modules.)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any client side framework doing this and I haven't really tried it, but I don't see why it cannot be easily done (at least, in theory).\r\n\r\nFirst, during the build process, create compressed doppelgangers for all content files (primarily, js files). For example, for `main-abc.js`, we create `main-abc.js.gz` (or something like that).\r\n\r\nWhen an angular app requests js files from a browser, add a content encoding header (gzip or br).  Then, the compressed doppelganger is served instead of the original js file. Not sure exactly how, at this point, though.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be instead of using js, simply use js.gzip or other compressed/binary files in the framework. The app simply downloads compressed js files and uncompress them before using them. This will require some kind of bootstrap.js to be loaded first so that it can download and uncompress, say, main.js.gz, etc. Again, I'm not entirely sure what the implications of doing this is.

On a new project I have issues to import interfaces automatically. For example I want to import this interface to my app.component.ts:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nexport interface TestInterface {\r\n    string: name;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\nIt is located in src/app/testInterface.ts. When i try to import it in my app.component.ts:\r\n<pre><code>\r\ntest: testInterface;\r\n</code></pre>\r\nI am using VSC and IntelliSense is not showing me the option to autoimport/import the interface anymore. When i press Ctrl+. for Quick Fix I receive the message: No code actions available. In Angular 9 with Typescript 3.8.3 everything works fine, IntelliSense shows me the autoimport option or I can import the interface with Ctrl+. Key Binding. If I manually add the import it works:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nimport { testInterface } from 'src/app/testInterface';\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Reproduction\r\nTo reproduce this issue try to install the latest angular/cli (at the moment of writing v10.0.1):\r\n<pre><code>\r\nnpm i @angular/cli@10.0.1 -g\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThen create a new project:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nng new\r\n</code></pre>\r\nName it as you wish, I have enabled routing and choosen CSS for stylesheets.\r\n\r\nWhen you install Angular 9 and create an project:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nnpm i @angular/cli@9.1.10 -g\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<pre><code>\r\nng new\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nEverything works as it should\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Environment\r\nMy Environment is:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n    _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n   / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n  / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n/_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.18.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.1\r\n@angular/material                 10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code Version 1.46.1\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Issues with importing interfaces created with export interface in Angular and TypeScript 3.9.6\" (#18170)"},{"Id":"652249376","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-06T19:02:17","Actor":"amdw","Number":"18177","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng test succeeds despite component compilation failures","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\nNot sure - probably something to do with testing or the CLI.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNot as far as I know.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when running tests using `ng test`, the compile-time error-checking applied to components appears to be significantly laxer than what happens in other CLI workflows such as `ng serve` and `ng build`.\r\n\r\nI was able to find several ways to write an Angular template incorrectly, which result in (expected) compile errors when you run `ng serve` or `ng build`, but when you run `ng test`, tests which compile these components and make assertions about the resulting DOM succeed without any problems at all.\r\n\r\nI found it very surprising that tests of this type would succeed when the components completely fail to compile in other contexts. At first I thought I must be doing something very obvious wrong, but I was able to reproduce the problem with a very simple component using the out-of-the-box configuration generated by `ng new --strict` at the latest version.\r\n\r\nI searched online, and I was surprised to be unable to find any references to this problem. I did find a couple of similar-looking issues where errors in a template did not result in the test failures one would expect, but these are for non-existent HTML elements:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36171\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36430\r\n\r\nSo either this is a different but similar-looking problem, or these previously-reported problems are broader than these existing issues suggest. I tried setting `enableIvy = false` in my repro (see below), and it made no difference, so this problem does not appear to be Ivy-specific; since the issues above do appear to be Ivy-specific, I suspect this is a different problem.\r\n\r\nEither way, such significant discrepancies between test and non-test behaviours raise concerns about the usefulness of Angular tests for ensuring the code quality of components.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created the following GitHub repository to reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/amdw/templates-test-repro\r\n\r\nThere are two branches, `master` and `nonstrict`. In both cases, `ng serve` fails with a compile error, but `ng test` succeeds, despite the fact that the tests compile the broken `MyComponent` and make assertions about the contents of its DOM.\r\n\r\nI would expect both commands to fail with a compile error - or at the very least, this behavioural discrepancy should be prominently mentioned in testing-related documentation [such as this](https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-test-scenarios), with a description of how tests can be configured to have the same compilation behaviour as these other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch just uses the default compiler settings generated by `ng new --strict`. `MyComponent` has an incorrect HTML template: `myinput` can be undefined according to the component type signature, but one of its fields is being unconditionally dereferenced. Running `ng serve` or `ng build` results in a compile error, as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in src/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:7:27 - error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever `ng test` results in 100% success, with no mention in the logs that there is any problem at all.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this might be a problem with the new-ish `strictTemplates` settings, since that is the context in which I discovered the problem (I was trying to convert an existing application to use `strictTemplates`; I got to a stage where my tests were 100% green, and thought I must be nearly done, but when I ran `ng serve` I got a flood of errors caused by type-checking failures in my HTML templates).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did a little more experimentation and found that is not the case. The `nonstrict` branch switches `strictTemplates` and `strictInjectionParameters` to `false`, and introduces another template error, referencing a component attribute which does not even exist. Once again, `ng build` and `ng serve` result in the expected failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:6:39 - error TS2339: Property 'nonexistent' does not exist on type 'MycomponentComponent'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, once again, `ng test` results in 100% success.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nN/A - the problem is that tests pass when I believe they shouldn't.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of anything.

To be able to further type in this input I apply for it z-index which is higher than overlayContainer has. It works fine until we add mat-select inside the custom overlay panel. Then if we open mat-select the mat-select's panel might be overlapped by the input because it will always have z-index higher.

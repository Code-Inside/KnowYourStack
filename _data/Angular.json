This is a result of the bug at [nodejs/undici#4743](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/4743).\n- Fixed decoding of the query components of `<a>` and `<area>` elements in non-UTF-8 documents.\n- Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches and `WebSocket` upgrade requests to be interceptable by the new customizable resource loading. (Except synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`s.)\n- Fixed the referrer of a document to be set correctly when redirects are involved; it is now the initiating page, not the last hop in the redirect chain.\n- Fixed correctness bugs when passing `ArrayBuffer`s or typed arrays to various APIs, where they would not correctly snapshot the data.\n- Fixed `require(\"url\").parse()` deprecation warning when using `WebSocket`s.\n- Fixed `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, and `<img>` (when `canvas` is installed) to fire `load` events, not `error` events, on non-OK HTTP responses.\n- Fixed many small issues in `XMLHttpRequest`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiJtYWluIiwibGFiZWxzIjpbImFjdGlvbjogbWVyZ2UiLCJhcmVhOiBidWlsZCAmIGNpIiwidGFyZ2V0OiBhdXRvbWF0aW9uIl19-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66898","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update dependency jsdom to v28 (main)\" (#66898)"},{"Id":"3894535684","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T04:28:53","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"66897","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): simplify design of parse errors","State":"open","Body":"Removes the `parseErrors` property on `FormUiControl` and instead introduces a new utility `transformedValue` that automatically handles synchronizing the raw value and model value using the given `parse` and `format` functions.

For example, a component with selector `svg.some-class` is created in the correct namespace (see `namespaceURI`):\n\n<img width=\"471\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b0f6872-139d-4ad1-bbb6-54c6d1699cd2\" />\n\nHowever, any child `path`, `g`, etc are not created in the correct namespace when done using `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` (see `namespaceURI`):\n\n<img width=\"471\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985779f6-2d6a-43f1-be4d-1ccd7eaa7b1e\" />\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAs I see it, the neatest solution would be either to:\n\n1) allow `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` to accept a `hostElement` parameter, just as `createComponent` does, or\n2) make `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` accept a `nameSpace` parameter, or\n3) allow a `nameSpace` field in the `@Component` decorator.\n\nI would by far prefer 1, as this would allow dynamic selection of the component's host node. This would extend beyond this case - for example, a button component can be attached to either an `a` or `button` element dynamically.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66893","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enhance `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` to cater for SVG elements and beyond\"

customization. See [the new README](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/2b65c6a80af2c899e32933c5e0cb842164852149/README.md#loading-subresources) for details on the new API.\n- Added MIME type sniffing to `<iframe>` and `<frame>` loads.\n- Regression: `WebSocket`s are no longer correctly throttled to one connection per origin. This is a result of the bug at [nodejs/undici#4743](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/4743).\n- Fixed decoding of the query components of `<a>` and `<area>` elements in non-UTF-8 documents.\n- Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches and `WebSocket` upgrade requests to be interceptable by the new customizable resource loading. (Except synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`s.)\n- Fixed the referrer of a document to be set correctly when redirects are involved; it is now the initiating page, not the last hop in the redirect chain.\n- Fixed correctness bugs when passing `ArrayBuffer`s or typed arrays to various APIs, where they would not correctly snapshot the data.\n- Fixed `require(\"url\").parse()` deprecation warning when using `WebSocket`s.\n- Fixed `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, and `<img>` (when `canvas` is installed) to fire `load` events, not `error` events, on non-OK HTTP responses.\n- Fixed many small issues in `XMLHttpRequest`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiJtYWluIiwibGFiZWxzIjpbImFjdGlvbjogbWVyZ2UiLCJhcmVhOiBidWlsZCAmIGNpIiwidGFyZ2V0OiBhdXRvbWF0aW9uIl19-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32421","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dependency jsdom to v28 (main)\" (#32421)"},{"Id":"3888261263","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T21:20:50","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32410","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.1.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `b48eb30` → `5f79001` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `31db864` → `3bec118` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `31db864` → `3bec118` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiIyMS4xLngiLCJsYWJlbHMiOlsiYWN0aW9uOiBtZXJnZSIsImFyZWE6IGJ1aWxkICYgY2kiLCJ0YXJnZXQ6IGF1dG9tYXRpb24iXX0=-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32410","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.1.x)\" (#32410)"},{"Id":"3895757264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T21:20:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32426","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `27c3245` → `5f79001` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `5f0d1a6` → `3bec118` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `5f0d1a6` → `3bec118` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiJtYWluIiwibGFiZWxzIjpbImFjdGlvbjogbWVyZ2UiLCJhcmVhOiBidWlsZCAmIGNpIiwidGFyZ2V0OiBhdXRvbWF0aW9uIl19-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32426","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (main)\" (#32426)"},{"Id":"3897865905","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-04T18:29:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32428","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): bundle setup files in unit-test builder for Vitest","State":"open","Body":"This change updates the Vitest runner in the unit-test builder to bundle 'setupFiles' through the application build pipeline, similar to test files.

(by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20320](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20320))\n\n- Added the `tsconfig` option for the `resolver` options (replacement for `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin`). Can be `false` (disabled), `true` (use the default `tsconfig.json` file to search for it), a string path to `tsconfig.json`, or an object with `configFile` and `references` options. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20400](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20400))\n\n- Support `import.defer()` for context modules. (by [@&#8203;ahabhgk](https://redirect.github.com/ahabhgk) in [#&#8203;20399](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20399))\n\n- Added support for array values ​​to the `devtool` option. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20191](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20191))\n\n- Improve rendering node built-in modules for ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20255](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20255))\n\n- Unknown import.meta properties are now determined at runtime instead of being statically analyzed at compile time. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20312](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20312))\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed ESM default export handling for `.mjs` files in Module Federation (by [@&#8203;y-okt](https://redirect.github.com/y-okt) in [#&#8203;20189](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20189))\n\n- Optimized `import.meta.env` handling in destructuring assignments by using cached stringified environment definitions. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20313](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20313))\n\n- Respect the `stats.errorStack` option in stats output. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20258](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20258))\n\n- Fixed a bug where declaring a `module` variable in module scope would conflict with the default `moduleArgument`.

Previously, when context was not set, it would fallback to the virtual scheme path (e.g., `virtual:routes`), which is not a valid filesystem path, causing subsequent resolve operations to fail. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20390](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20390))\n\n- Fixed Worker self-import handling to support various URL patterns (e.g., `import.meta.url`, `new URL(import.meta.url)`, `new URL(import.meta.url, import.meta.url)`, `new URL(\"./index.js\", import.meta.url)`). Workers that resolve to the same module are now properly deduplicated, regardless of the URL syntax used. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20381](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20381))\n\n- Reuse the same async entrypoint for the same Worker URL within a module to avoid circular dependency warnings when multiple Workers reference the same resource. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20345](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20345))\n\n- Fixed a bug where a self-referencing dependency would have an unused export name when imported inside a web worker. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20251](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20251))\n\n- Fix missing export generation when concatenated modules in different chunks share the same runtime in module library bundles. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20346](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20346))\n\n- Fixed `import.meta.env.xxx` behavior: when accessing a non-existent property, it now returns empty object instead of full object at runtime. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20289](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20289))\n\n- Improved parsing error reporting by adding a link to the loader documentation. (by [@&#8203;gaurav10gg](https://redirect.github.com/gaurav10gg) in [#&#8203;20244](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20244))\n\n- Fix typescript types. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20305](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20305))\n\n- Add declaration for unused harmony import specifier. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20286](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20286))\n\n- Fix compressibility of modules while retaining portability. (by [@&#8203;dmichon-msft](https://redirect.github.com/dmichon-msft) in [#&#8203;20287](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20287))\n\n- Optimize source map generation: only include `ignoreList` property when it has content, avoiding empty arrays in source maps. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20319](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20319))\n\n- Preserve star exports for dependencies in ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20293](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20293))\n\n- Consider asset modulem to be side-effect free.

Changes\n\n- Allow resolving worker module by export condition name when using `new Worker()` (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20353](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20353))\n\n- Detect conditional imports to avoid compile-time linking errors for non-existent exports. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20320](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20320))\n\n- Added the `tsconfig` option for the `resolver` options (replacement for `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin`). Can be `false` (disabled), `true` (use the default `tsconfig.json` file to search for it), a string path to `tsconfig.json`, or an object with `configFile` and `references` options. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20400](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20400))\n\n- Support `import.defer()` for context modules. (by [@&#8203;ahabhgk](https://redirect.github.com/ahabhgk) in [#&#8203;20399](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20399))\n\n- Added support for array values ​​to the `devtool` option. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20191](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20191))\n\n- Improve rendering node built-in modules for ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20255](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20255))\n\n- Unknown import.meta properties are now determined at runtime instead of being statically analyzed at compile time. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20312](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20312))\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed ESM default export handling for `.mjs` files in Module Federation (by [@&#8203;y-okt](https://redirect.github.com/y-okt) in [#&#8203;20189](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20189))\n\n- Optimized `import.meta.env` handling in destructuring assignments by using cached stringified environment definitions. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20313](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20313))\n\n- Respect the `stats.errorStack` option in stats output. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20258](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20258))\n\n- Fixed a bug where declaring a `module` variable in module scope would conflict with the default `moduleArgument`. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20265](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20265))\n\n- Fix VirtualUrlPlugin to set resourceData.context for proper module resolution. Previously, when context was not set, it would fallback to the virtual scheme path (e.g., `virtual:routes`), which is not a valid filesystem path, causing subsequent resolve operations to fail. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20390](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20390))\n\n- Fixed Worker self-import handling to support various URL patterns (e.g., `import.meta.url`, `new URL(import.meta.url)`, `new URL(import.meta.url, import.meta.url)`, `new URL(\"./index.js\", import.meta.url)`). Workers that resolve to the same module are now properly deduplicated, regardless of the URL syntax used. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20381](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20381))\n\n- Reuse the same async entrypoint for the same Worker URL within a module to avoid circular dependency warnings when multiple Workers reference the same resource. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20345](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20345))\n\n- Fixed a bug where a self-referencing dependency would have an unused export name when imported inside a web worker. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20251](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20251))\n\n- Fix missing export generation when concatenated modules in different chunks share the same runtime in module library bundles. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20346](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20346))\n\n- Fixed `import.meta.env.xxx` behavior: when accessing a non-existent property, it now returns empty object instead of full object at runtime. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20289](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20289))\n\n- Improved parsing error reporting by adding a link to the loader documentation. (by [@&#8203;gaurav10gg](https://redirect.github.com/gaurav10gg) in [#&#8203;20244](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20244))\n\n- Fix typescript types. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20305](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20305))\n\n- Add declaration for unused harmony import specifier. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20286](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20286))\n\n- Fix compressibility of modules while retaining portability. (by [@&#8203;dmichon-msft](https://redirect.github.com/dmichon-msft) in [#&#8203;20287](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20287))\n\n- Optimize source map generation: only include `ignoreList` property when it has content, avoiding empty arrays in source maps. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20319](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20319))\n\n- Preserve star exports for dependencies in ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20293](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20293))\n\n- Consider asset modulem to be side-effect free. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20352](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20352))\n\n- Avoid generating JavaScript modules for CSS exports that are not used, reducing unnecessary output and bundle size. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20337](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20337))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ1cGRhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0My4wLjgiLCJ0YXJnZXRCcmFuY2giOiJtYWluIiwibGFiZWxzIjpbImFjdGlvbjogbWVyZ2UiLCJhcmVhOiBidWlsZCAmIGNpIiwidGFyZ2V0OiBhdXRvbWF0aW9uIl19-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32413","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies (main)\" (#32413)"},{"Id":"3886439630","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T15:05:07","Actor":"ChristopherKuehnelNexus","Number":"32408","RawContent":null,"Title":"build sometime fails with exit code 3221226356 on windows","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2.20\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\n\nI'm facing an issue I can not find the reason for. We have libraries that we want to update from angular 18 to 20. Sadly when building them on our build server we often run into ```ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 3221226356.```.

Install Node.js (tested with Node 24 and Node 22)\n2. Uninstall Angular CLI globally:\n```bash\nnpm uninstall -g @angular/cli\n```\n3. Clear npm cache:\n```bash\nnpm cache verify\n```\n4. Install latest Angular CLI globally:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @angular/cli@latest\n```\n5. Run ng v for version check\n```bash\nng version\n```\n\n----\n### Actual Result\nRunning ng version from a normal command prompt shows old Angular CLI version:\n```yaml\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n```\n\nHowever, running the same command from npm global directory works correctly:\n```bash\ncd C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\nng version\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n```yaml\n> cd \"C:\\<username>\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\"\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm>ng v\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI       : 21.1.2\nNode.js           : 22.22.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 9.7.2\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n```\n\n### Observations\n\n- `where ng` outputs:\n```yaml\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\ng\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\ng.cmd\n```\n- `npm` binaries exist in: `C:\\Program Files\\nodejs` and `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm`\n- `ng` binary exist in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm` \n- The CLI version used depends on the current working directory, which is unexpected behavior.\n- Manually copying ng / ng.cmd (C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm -> C:\\Users\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm) or @angular directories (C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules -> C:\\Users\\harsh\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules) does not resolve the issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nAfter installing the latest Angular CLI globally, running ng from any directory should consistently use the latest installed version.\n\n### Additional Context (Multiple Users Affected)\n\nThis issue does not appear to be isolated. Multiple users have reported very similar behavior on Windows.\n\nFor example, the following Medium post describes the same issue with Angular CLI versions not updating globally and behaving inconsistently depending on execution path:\n\n- https://medium.com/@divyanshchauhan28/how-i-solved-a-confusing-updating-angular-version-issue-9a4af977d31a\n\nThis suggests a broader issue related to **Windows PATH resolution, npm global binaries, or Node.js upgrades,** rather than a one-off local setup problem.\n\n### Request\n- Please let us know if this is a known Angular CLI issue or an npm / Node.js / Windows PATH-related problem.\n- If this issue belongs in another repository (Node.js, npm, or Windows), kindly suggest the correct place to report it.\n- Any official guidance or recommended workaround would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRequest\n- Please let us know if this is a known Angular CLI issue or an npm / Node.js / Windows PATH-related problem.\n- If this issue belongs in another repository (Node.js, npm, or Windows), kindly suggest the correct place to report it.\n- Any official guidance or recommended workaround would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n\n\ngetting Angular version undefined issue\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 22.22.0\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.12\n@angular/cli                 18.2.12\n@schematics/angular          18.2.12\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32403","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI global update not reflected on Windows unless executed from npm global directory\" (#32403)"},{"Id":"3884151020","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:52:09","Actor":"jgtestw","Number":"32405","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content Security Policy and SPAs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently CSP and SPAs don't work well together.\n\nThere is however something very simple we could do to make CSP 100% compatible with SPA.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWhen Angular builds the app, also output a file called hashes.json.

The `label` element is displayed (it is just a mock empty `label` element to illustrate the point).\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nStyles affecting generic elements (not owned by Angular Material, such as `label`) should not \"leak\" into the global styles.\n\nProbably a solution would be to prefix that selector with `.mat-mdc-slide-toggle`, like:\n\n```css\n.mat-mdc-slide-toggle label:empty {\n   display: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAll empty `label` elements are being affected right now by the aforementioned change.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.1.2\n- CDK/Material: 21.1.2 \n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): linux x64\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32736","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-slide-toggle): do not leak component styles to global styles (\"label:empty\" selector)\" (#32736)"},{"Id":"3885847688","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T17:51:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32733","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix up event naming in Aria","State":"closed","Body":"Some Aria directives were using outputs prefixed with `on` which is explicitly called out as a anti-pattern in the styleguide (see https://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs#choosing-event-names).\r\n\r\nFixes #32727.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32733","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix up event naming in Aria\" (#32733)"},{"Id":"3872710241","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T17:51:17","Actor":"nivekh","Number":"32727","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Menu): Aria Menu has an output prefixed with \"on\", discouraged elsewhere","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs#choosing-event-names\n> Avoid prefixing output names with \"on\".\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/aria/menu/Menu\n> onSelect\n> A callback function triggered when a menu item is selected.\n\nRan into this when `@angular-eslint/no-output-on-prefix` linter rule fired in a component which is forwarding this directive.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/aria/menu/Menu","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32727","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Menu): Aria Menu has an output prefixed with \"on\", discouraged elsewhere\" (#32727)"},{"Id":"3886960775","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-02T16:49:14","Actor":"csirota97-a11y","Number":"32735","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): Accessibility scan showing Orphaned Form Label failure when correctly using the component","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am using 18.2.14; however, this issue also present on the https://material.angular.dev/components/select/overview page.\n\nWhen using the WAVE accessibility scanner, we see that every mat-select present on the page flags an \"Orphaned Form Label\" accessibility failure.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nREPL: https://material.angular.dev/components/select/examples\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

primarily on low-contrast background color and are not sufficiently visible (WCAG 2.4.7 / 2.4.11)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe’ve observed a recurring accessibility issue across several Angular Material components where the keyboard focus indicator relies primarily on a subtle background color change, often without a visible outline or border.\n\nIn many cases, the focus state is indicated only by a light background shade (e.g., light grey or light blue), which is difficult or impossible to perceive, especially:\n\n- For users with low vision\n- For users with color vision deficiencies\n- In bright environments or low-quality displays\n- When components are placed on similar colored backgrounds\n\n**This affects multiple components, including (but not limited to):**\n\n- Buttons\n- Icon buttons\n- List items\n- Menu items\n- Tabs\n- Select options\n- Table rows / interactive rows\n\nWhy this is an accessibility problem\nWCAG 2.4.7 – Focus Visible (Level AA)\nKeyboard focus must be visible.\n\n- In many Angular Material components, the current focus indicator:\n- Has no distinct shape (no outline, border)\n- Is visually indistinguishable from hover or selected states\n- This makes keyboard navigation extremely difficult for users who rely on visible focus.\n\n**From an accessibility testing perspective:**\n\n- Users cannot reliably tell where focus is on the page\n- Screen magnifier users lose orientation\n- Keyboard-only users frequently get “lost” in complex UIs\n- The UI technically supports keyboard, but practically fails usability\n\nThis results in applications built with Angular Material failing accessibility compliance (WCAG) unless we manually override focus styles.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\nWith a distinct visual affordance, such as:\n\n- Outline\n- Border\n\nCurrently we have to implement custom global CSS overrides just to achieve basic focus visibility, which defeats the purpose of a component library that claims accessibility support out of the box.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly backgroing color appears on focus, and this color is very light and very hard to notice by the users with vision impairements. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

CSS classes of mat-nav-list and mat-list-item), because the List component does not have a supported style override for active list item font or font weight\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/list/examples#list-navigation\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nActive navigation list item should be recognizable as such even it a user does not notice the background color change\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nActive navigation list item is not recognizable as such when a user does not notice the background color change\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: v21\n- CDK/Material: v21\n- Browser(s): any\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): any\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32716","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-nav-list): Active item not accessible enough\" (#32716)"},{"Id":"3865251546","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-28T12:37:42","Actor":"rdneagu","Number":"32715","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdkTable & mat-table): virtual scrolling shifting issues introduced in 21.1","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n21.0.0\n\n### Description\n\nIn version v20.0.0 we had used a custom virtual scrolling strategy to allow tables with sticky headers. Upgrade to 21.0.0 broke the custom scrolling strategy implementation we have used so we decided to look for alternatives. Luckily, It seems that 21.0 also introduced support for tables with sticky header (or was introduced earlier, I am actually not sure which version added support), unfortunately, version 21.1 seems to introduce a bug which makes the scrolling shift around.\n\nThe bug can be seen in the example provided in the Table documentation as well. The documentation is still running on 21.0.0 but if you upgrade the example to 21.1.1, you can start seeing the buggy behavior when scrolling.\n\nScrolling seems to be fixed when `itemSize` is set to 0, however, in infinite scrolling implementations using DataSource that rely on `collectionViewer.onViewChange` `range.end`, it will continuously fetch the next page since `range.end` will always be the max value (3rd stackblitz link in the reproduction links has an async implementation mocked example that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts` in constructor)\n\nExample provided is on mat-table but cdkTable's behavior is the same if not worse\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nv21.0 (original example on version 21.0): https://stackblitz.com/edit/dfp4dgn5?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 (original example but on version 21.1.1): https://stackblitz.com/edit/6wi4nsxd?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 with DataSource: https://stackblitz.com/edit/gt9emjwr?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts (much more noticeable in this example)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Scroll around using the scroll wheel (also happens when you drag around the scrollbar thumb especially visible in tables with small amount of rows)\n2. 3rd link has an infinite scrolling implementation that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts`'s constructor\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table should scroll correctly without shifting around\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nScrolling shifts around, some cases making it impossible to even scroll back up once you go all the way down and some cases scrolls upwards when scrolling down\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.1.1\n- CDK/Material: 21.1.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows & macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTable & mat-table): virtual scrolling shifting issues introduced in 21.1\" (#32715)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2026-02-05T03:30:03.3540305Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2268}

It is advertised that we should instead use `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()`. However the behavior between those two methods are different and cannot necessarily replace each other for all use-cases.\r\n\r\nMy use-case is to create a component dynamically, **not** insert it into DOM, call a few custom methods on it, and then destroy the component. But `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` will always insert the newly created component into DOM, wreaking havoc in my layout.\r\n\r\nBasically I'd like to do something like that:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprivate validate(component: Type<DropdownComponent>): boolean {\r\n    const injector = Injector.create({providers: this.getMyCustomProvider(), parent: this.getMyParentInjector()});\r\n    const factory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory<DropdownComponent>(component);\r\n\r\n    const dropdownComponentRef = factory.create(injector);\r\n    const result = dropdownComponentRef.instance.isValid();\r\n    dropdownComponentRef.destroy();\r\n\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWas it intentional that a component cannot be instantiated without being inserted into DOM anymore ? Or should it be considered a regression in the feature set of the framework ?\r\n\r\nOr is there an alternative API that would allow me to instantiate and destroy components without ever inserting them into DOM ?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.2.5\r\nNode: 14.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.5\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1302.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.2.5\r\n@angular/flex-layout            13.0.0-beta.38\r\n@schematics/angular             13.2.5\r\nng-packagr                      13.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.4\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cannot create component without inserting into DOM without the deprecated `ComponentFactory`\" (#45263)"},{"Id":"1159571670","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-04T12:01:51","Actor":"LucaBruni","Number":"45262","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix service worker generation","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Use `source.getIndentString()` for the old behaviour (guess, and if no lines are indented, return `\\t`)\n-   `bundle.getIndentString()` ignores sources with no indented lines when guessing indentation ([#&#8203;3](https://togithub.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/issues/3))\n\n#### 0.2.7\n\n-   `source.trimLines()` removes empty lines from start/end of source, leaving other whitespace untouched\n-   Indentation is not added to an empty source\n\n#### 0.2.6\n\n-   Performance improvement - adjustments are only made when necessary\n\n#### 0.2.5\n\n-   Single spaces are ignored when guessing indentation - experience shows these are more likely to be e.g. JSDoc comments than actual indentation\n-   `bundle.addSource()` can take an `indentExclusionRanges` option\n\n#### 0.2.4\n\n-   Empty lines are not indented\n\n#### 0.2.3\n\n-   Fixes edge case with bundle sourcemaps\n\n#### 0.2.2\n\n-   Make `sources` paths in sourcemaps relative to `options.file`\n\n#### 0.2.1\n\n-   Minor fix for `bundle.indent()`\n\n#### 0.2.0\n\n-   Implement `MagicString.Bundle` for concatenating magic strings\n\n#### 0.1.10\n\n-   Fix sourcemap encoding\n\n#### 0.1.9\n\n-   Better performance when indenting large chunks of code\n\n#### 0.1.8\n\n-   Sourcemaps generated with `s.generateMap()` have a `toUrl()` method that generates a DataURI\n\n#### 0.1.7\n\n-   Implement `s.insert( index, content )` - roughly equivalent to `s.replace( index, index, content )`\n\n#### 0.1.6\n\n-   Version bump for npm's benefit\n\n#### 0.1.5\n\n-   `s.indent({ exclude: [ x, y ] })` prevents lines between (original) characters `x` and `y` from being indented. Multiple exclusion ranges are also supported (e.g. `exclude: [[a, b], [c, d]]`)\n\n#### 0.1.4\n\n-   `s.locate()` doesn't throw out-of-bound error if index is equal to original string's length\n\n#### 0.1.3\n\n-   `s.trim()` returns `this` (i.e. is chainable)\n\n#### 0.1.2\n\n-   Implement `s.slice()`\n\n#### 0.1.1\n\n-   Implement `s.trim()`\n\n#### 0.1.0\n\n-   First release\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I believe this is a bug in Safari because the [CSS `transform` specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-1/#transform-rendering) doesn't seem to distinguish between 2D and 3D transforms as far as rendering order:\n\n    > For elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, any value other than `none` for the `transform` property results in the creation of a stacking context.\n\n    This bug means that minifying a 3D transform into a 2D transform must be avoided even though it's a valid transformation because it can cause rendering differences in Safari. Previously esbuild sometimes minified 3D CSS transforms into 2D CSS transforms but with this release, esbuild will no longer do that:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div { transform: matrix3d(2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    div{transform:scale(2)}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    div{transform:scale3d(2,2,1)}\n    ```\n\n-   Minification now takes advantage of the `?.` operator\n\n    This adds new code minification rules that shorten code with the `?.` optional chaining operator when the result is equivalent:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    let foo = (x) => {\n      if (x !== null && x !== undefined) x.y()\n      return x === null || x === undefined ? undefined : x.z\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    let foo=n=>(n!=null&&n.y(),n==null?void 0:n.z);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    let foo=n=>(n?.y(),n?.z);\n    ```\n\n    This only takes effect when minification is enabled and when the configured target environment is known to support the optional chaining operator. As always, make sure to set `--target=` to the appropriate language target if you are running the minified code in an environment that doesn't support the latest JavaScript features.\n\n-   Add source mapping information for some non-executable tokens ([#&#8203;1448](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1448))\n\n    Code coverage tools can generate reports that tell you if any code exists that has not been run (or \"covered\") during your tests. You can use this information to add additional tests for code that isn't currently covered.\n\n    Some popular JavaScript code coverage tools have bugs where they incorrectly consider lines without any executable code as uncovered, even though there's no test you could possibly write that would cause those lines to be executed. For example, they apparently complain about the lines that only contain the trailing `}` token of an object literal.\n\n    With this release, esbuild now generates source mappings for some of these trailing non-executable tokens. This may not successfully work around bugs in code coverage tools because there are many non-executable tokens in JavaScript and esbuild doesn't map them all (the drawback of mapping these extra tokens is that esbuild will use more memory, build more slowly, and output a bigger source map). The true solution is to fix the bugs in the code coverage tools in the first place.\n\n-   Fall back to WebAssembly on Android x64 ([#&#8203;2068](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2068))\n\n    Go's compiler supports trivial cross-compiling to almost all platforms without installing any additional software other than the Go compiler itself. This has made it very easy for esbuild to publish native binary executables for many platforms. However, it strangely doesn't support cross-compiling to Android x64 without installing the Android build tools. So instead of publishing a native esbuild binary executable to npm, this release publishes a WebAssembly fallback build. This is essentially the same as the `esbuild-wasm` package but it's installed automatically when you install the `esbuild` package on Android x64. So packages that depend on the `esbuild` package should now work on Android x64. If you want to use a native binary executable of esbuild on Android x64, you may be able to build it yourself from source after installing the Android build tools.\n\n-   Update to Go 1.17.8\n\n    The version of the Go compiler used to compile esbuild has been upgraded from Go 1.17.7 to Go 1.17.8, which fixes the RISC-V 64-bit build. Compiler optimizations for the RISC-V 64-bit build have now been re-enabled.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v2.6.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;260-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribmini-css-extract-plugincomparev253v260-2022-03-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.5.3...v2.6.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   added `baseUri` option support (from entry options) ([#&#8203;915](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/915)) ([6004d95](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/6004d95cad2d18d9d080d913db7dc48f16bf888c))\n\n##### [2.5.3](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.5.2...v2.5.3) (2022-01-25)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   types ([#&#8203;903](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/903)) ([6650691](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/6650691f7e6a45004779566c909a0e48e9d67f04))\n\n##### [2.5.2](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.5.1...v2.5.2) (2022-01-17)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   types ([dfb9afd](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/dfb9afdfb2ea6c816d6d4986fbb382dac300e7ea))\n\n##### [2.5.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1) (2022-01-17)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   cjs export and types ([e836a00](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/commit/e836a00cb164fecdb49e670e0552475477fa7994))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.24`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01424)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.23...v0.14.24)\n\n-   Allow `es2022` as a target environment ([#&#8203;2012](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2012))\n\n    TypeScript recently [added support for `es2022`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-6/#target-es2022) as a compilation target so esbuild now supports this too. Support for this is preliminary as there is no published ES2022 specification yet (i.e. https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/ exists but https://tc39.es/ecma262/2022/ is a 404 error). The meaning of esbuild's `es2022` target may change in the future when the specification is finalized. Right now I have made the `es2022` target enable support for the syntax-related [finished proposals](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposals/blob/main/finished-proposals.md) that are marked as `2022`:\n\n    -   Class fields\n    -   Class private members\n    -   Class static blocks\n    -   Ergonomic class private member checks\n    -   Top-level await\n\n    I have also included the \"arbitrary module namespace names\" feature since I'm guessing it will end up in the ES2022 specification (this syntax feature was added to the specification without a proposal). TypeScript has [not added support for this yet](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/40594).\n\n-   Match `define` to strings in index expressions ([#&#8203;2050](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2050))\n\n    With this release, configuring `--define:foo.bar=baz` now matches and replaces both `foo.bar` and `foo['bar']` expressions in the original source code. This is necessary for people who have enabled TypeScript's [`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` feature](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature), which prevents you from using normal property access syntax on a type with an index signature such as in the following code:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare let foo: { [key: string]: any }\n    foo.bar // This is a type error if noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature is enabled\n    foo['bar']\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild would generate the following output with `--define:foo.bar=baz`:\n\n    ```js\n    baz;\n    foo[\"bar\"];\n    ```\n\n    Now esbuild will generate the following output instead:\n\n    ```js\n    baz;\n    baz;\n    ```\n\n-   Add `--mangle-quoted` to mangle quoted properties ([#&#8203;218](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/218))\n\n    The `--mangle-props=` flag tells esbuild to automatically rename all properties matching the provided regular expression to shorter names to save space. Previously esbuild never modified the contents of string literals. In particular, `--mangle-props=_` would mangle `foo._bar` but not `foo['_bar']`. There are some coding patterns where renaming quoted property names is desirable, such as when using TypeScript's [`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` feature](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature) or when using TypeScript's [discriminated union narrowing behavior](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions):\n\n    ```ts\n    interface Foo { _foo: string }\n    interface Bar { _bar: number }\n    declare const value: Foo | Bar\n    console.log('_foo' in value ? value._foo : value._bar)\n    ```\n\n    The `'_foo' in value` check tells TypeScript to narrow the type of `value` to `Foo` in the true branch and to `Bar` in the false branch. Previously esbuild didn't mangle the property name `'_foo'` because it was inside a string literal. With this release, you can now use `--mangle-quoted` to also rename property names inside string literals:\n\n    ```js\n    // Old output (with --mangle-props=_)\n    console.log(\"_foo\" in value ? value.a : value.b);\n\n    // New output (with --mangle-props=_ --mangle-quoted)\n    console.log(\"a\" in value ? value.a : value.b);\n    ```\n\n-   Parse and discard TypeScript `export as namespace` statements ([#&#8203;2070](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2070))\n\n    TypeScript `.d.ts` type declaration files can sometimes contain statements of the form `export as namespace foo;`. I believe these serve to declare that the module adds a property of that name to the global object. You aren't supposed to feed `.d.ts` files to esbuild so this normally doesn't matter, but sometimes esbuild can end up having to parse them. One such case is if you import a type-only package who's `main` field in `package.json` is a `.d.ts` file.\n\n    Previously esbuild only allowed `export as namespace` statements inside a `declare` context:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare module Foo {\n      export as namespace foo;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now esbuild will also allow these statements outside of a `declare` context:\n\n    ```ts\n    export as namespace foo;\n    ```\n\n    These statements are still just ignored and discarded.\n\n-   Strip import assertions from unrecognized `import()` expressions ([#&#8203;2036](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2036))\n\n    The new \"import assertions\" JavaScript language feature adds an optional second argument to dynamic `import()` expressions, which esbuild does support. However, this optional argument must be stripped when targeting older JavaScript environments for which this second argument would be a syntax error. Previously esbuild failed to strip this second argument in cases when the first argument to `import()` wasn't a string literal. This problem is now fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(import(foo, { assert: { type: 'json' } }))\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    console.log(import(foo, { assert: { type: \"json\" } }));\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    console.log(import(foo));\n    ```\n\n-   Remove simplified statement-level literal expressions ([#&#8203;2063](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2063))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now removes simplified statement-level expressions if the simplified result is a literal expression even when minification is disabled. Previously this was only done when minification is enabled. This change was only made because some people are bothered by seeing top-level literal expressions. This change has no effect on code behavior.\n\n-   Ignore `.d.ts` rules in `paths` in `tsconfig.json` files ([#&#8203;2074](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2074), [#&#8203;2075](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2075))\n\n    TypeScript's `tsconfig.json` configuration file has a `paths` field that lets you remap import paths to alternative files on the file system. This field is interpreted by esbuild during bundling so that esbuild's behavior matches that of the TypeScript type checker. However, people sometimes override import paths to JavaScript files to instead point to a `.d.ts` TypeScript type declaration file for that JavaScript file. The intent of this is to just use the remapping for type information and not to actually import the `.d.ts` file during the build.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now ignore rules in `paths` that result in a `.d.ts` file during path resolution. This means code that does this should now be able to be bundled without modifying its `tsconfig.json` file to remove the `.d.ts` rule. This change was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Disable Go compiler optimizations for the Linux RISC-V 64bit build ([#&#8203;2035](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2035))\n\n    Go's RISC-V 64bit compiler target has a fatal compiler optimization bug that causes esbuild to crash when it's run: [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51101](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/51101). As a temporary workaround until a version of the Go compiler with the fix is published, Go compiler optimizations have been disabled for RISC-V. The 7.7mb esbuild binary executable for RISC-V is now 8.7mb instead. This workaround was contributed by [@&#8203;piggynl](https://togithub.com/piggynl).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier</summary>\n\n### [`v8.5.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-850-2022-03-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.4.0...v8.5.0)\n\n-   Added: \\[[@&#8203;typescript-eslint/space-before-blocks](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/space-before-blocks)].

This is problematic when you want to import an ES Module in your custom schematics, [for example `HtmlParser` from `@angular/compiler`](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/7a1672a83224a5a2f3e6b3d08de3e461514120ea/projects/schematics/src/shared/utils/file-utils.ts#L253) (which since ng13 is shipped only as ESM).\r\n\r\n#### Problems with not supporting ESM:\r\n\r\nThe following error started to occur for our custom schematics in runtime, since we upgraded from ng12 to 13:\r\n`require() of ES Module <path-to-the-repo>/node_modules/@angular/compiler/fesm2015/compiler.mjs not supported. Instead change the require of <path-to-the-repo>/node_modules/@angular/compiler/fesm2015/compiler.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.`\r\n\r\nBut the advised change of the static `@angular/compiler` to a dynamic import is cumbersome due to various reasons:\r\n- it unnecessarily changes the our synchronous code to asynchronous code\r\n- it induces passing down the `compilerModule` (result of `await import(@angular/compiler)`) as an argument down to all helper functions ([example in angular repo](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a432ad65c77d5888da49b630d5055da2b8f7513c/packages/core/schematics/migrations/router-link-empty-expression/index.ts#L61))\r\n- it requires a hacky workaround ticking the Typescript compiler so to avoid compiling the dynamic `import()` into the `require()` call  - for more see [the workaround function `loadEsmModule()` in angular repo ](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e0015d3c456d584242269b0765878d598a550888/packages/core/schematics/utils/load_esm.ts#L11-L35). Btw. this function is not exported in public API, so we need to copy-paste it to our repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nSupport executing ESM schematics .\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nChange the import of ESM to dynamic imports in our schematics code and deal with all its cumbersome consequences (described above).

Places that use\n    `pathMatch` will likely need to be updated to have an explicit\n    `Route`/`Routes` type so that TypeScript does not infer the type as\n    `string`.\n\n-   Previously, resolvers were waiting to be completed\n    before proceeding with the navigation and the Router would take the last\n    value emitted from the resolver.\n    The router now takes only the first emitted value by the resolvers\n    and then proceeds with navigation. This is now consistent with `Observables`\n    returned by other guards: only the first value is used.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7671a1e40d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7671a1e40d0f2abe1cb7e9d84d5ac47a5adb546a) | fix | canceled JSONP requests won't throw console error with missing callback function ([#&#8203;36807](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/36807)) |\n| [05d50b849b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/05d50b849bb891c37c3eefab81a45099057dfd78) | perf | make `NgLocalization` token tree-shakable ([#&#8203;45118](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45118)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [69018c9f42](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/69018c9f42d14c1c7aa8271b406d6d247de1c564) | feat | allow for injector to be specified when creating an embedded view ([#&#8203;45156](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45156)) |\n| [c5df474c7c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c5df474c7c744305c9412090b5e19bb6d4f7128d) | fix | remove individual commands for updating gold files ([#&#8203;45198](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45198)) |\n| [88f1168506](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/88f1168506befd0665125da1fca2a719cb27dbb5) | perf | only track LViews that are referenced in **ngContext** ([#&#8203;45172](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45172)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7ee121f595](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7ee121f595a47338b31098ae51a6f91d80c8fdce) | feat | Add untyped versions of the model classes for use in migration.

Now it only accepts `Observable<Tree>`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/37a06a7c37f5b4286d58b475e6e12c86f00fac5b/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/engine/interface.ts#L234-L237\r\n\r\nThe current problem with `Rule` accepting only `Observable<Tree>` it that it accepts only the `Observable` from rxjs of a fixed version `6.6.7` (at the moment of writing) which is hardcoded in `dependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c2737dd51ab68a538a317fc0d7a377032d346b53/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/package.json#L20\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I'm writing custom schematics in my repo, while having any slightly different version of `rxjs` installed, e.g. `6.6.3`, then I get an error about incompatible variants of the interface `Subscriber` - between my installed version in `node_modules` and the fixed version from `node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs` (which is derived from the interface `Rule`)\r\n\r\nExample of custom schematics for minimal reproduction:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Rule, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\nimport { of } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nexport function migrate(): Rule {\r\n  return (tree: Tree) => {\r\n    return of(tree);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message in detail:\r\n```\r\n(parameter) _context: SchematicContext\r\nType '(tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'Rule'.\r\n  Type 'Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'void | Rule | Tree | Observable<Tree> | Promise<void | Rule>'.\r\n    Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>'.\r\n      The types of 'source.operator.call' are incompatible between these types.\r\n        Type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic' is not assignable to type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic'.\r\n          Types of parameters 'subscriber' and 'subscriber' are incompatible.\r\n            Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>'.\r\n              Property 'isStopped' is protected but type 'Subscriber<T>' is not a class derived from 'Subscriber<T>'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- expose `Promise<Tree>` as a return type of `Rule`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- workaround on my side: return `Promise<Rule | void>` instead of `Promise<Tree>`\r\n- workaround on Angular's side: move `rxjs` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics` and relax the version to `^6.6.0` (but still.. what if somebody is using rxjs7 in their repo?)\r\n- I'm opened to your other suggested ideas or workarounds","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22783","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`Rule` from `@angular-devkit/schematics` should accept return type `Promise<Tree>`\" (#22783)"},{"Id":"1153249501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T14:11:21","Actor":"eng-dibo","Number":"22776","RawContent":null,"Title":"[@angular-devkit/build-angular] Cannot convert undefined or null to object","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

(even if my package.json requires v^7.4.0)\r\n\r\nthis makes the following line typely wrong if used inside an angular project (probably you may need to use a function or extend a class that uses rxjs.Observable from v7.4.0, but your root node_modules has rxjs v6.6.7)\r\n```\r\nimport { Observable} from 'rxjs';\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservable from both versions (i.e 6.6.7 and 7.4.0) are not compatible because there are many [breaking changes](https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary) between those versions, for example, `_isScalar` is removed from Observable at v7.0.0\r\n\r\n> the property _isScalar is missing in Observable\r\n\r\nthis specially happens in monorepos, where the angular project is a workspace inside that monorepo and there is another workspace that extends its functionality.\r\nin this case, the package managers may choose to install rxjs@6.6.7 in the root dir, and rxjs@7.4.0 inside the package's node_module dir.\r\n\r\n**my suggestion** is to update dependencies in @angular-devkit packages to remove that breaking changes between rxjs versions\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

To show a progress indicator, I listen for the router events of type ResolverStart and ResolverEnd only on the client while this data is being fetched.\r\n\r\nScenario 1: When the page is requested from the app, everything works as expected -> ResolverStart is raised -> a request is sent to the backend and once completed -> ResolverEnd is raised.\r\n\r\nSecenario 2: The problem occurs when the URL of the page is entered in the browser (or when refreshing the page) and the server has to render the page. The server actually manages to call the resolver function, fetch the data and send it to the client. However, as soon as the application starts, the entire chain repeats itself -> ResolverStart is raised -> Resolver function is executed -> ResolverEnd is raised. The only difference is that in this scenario the resolver function does not actually send a request to the Beckend, but uses the hydrated data.\r\n\r\nThis seems unnecessary as the users are already waiting while the server fetches the data from the backend, and I expect them to be shown the entire page and not the loading spinner for a fraction of a second that makes the page flicker.\r\n\r\nI believe that the resolver function in scenario 2 should only be executed on the server and the ResolverStart and ResolverEnd should not be triggered on the client. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Add resolver function to any route which calls an http get request.\r\n2.

However, this does not go far enough and fails to account for situations where entire paths are different between server and client. This can happen (such as in my case) when the server is in a Docker network and has direct access to other services and the browser uses a reverse proxy that allows access to the same service through path rewrites based on some known prefixes.\r\n\r\nFor example, `/api/foo` may be routed to an internal service and rewritten as `http://my-service:3000/foo`. Thus, the server needs to call `http://my-service:3000/foo` and the browser needs to call `/api/foo`. The difference between them is more than just the origin.\r\n\r\nThis same issue was mentioned in multiple comments (see below), but the final solutions that introduces `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` is somehow more limiting than the needs that were articulated. See the following comments and several others:\r\n\r\n[#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1792077410)\r\n[#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1832556707)\r\n\r\nScouring the above-mentioned issues and others, I could not find a way to address this use case, which means the transfer cache will never work for my setup.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThere are several possible ways to solve this:\r\n\r\n1. A new token similar to `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` that would allow mapping path prefixes rather than just origins.\r\n2. A way to override the cache key as suggested in #53702, [#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1792077410), [#53702 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53702#issuecomment-1898089674) and several others.\r\n3. A way to compose the current root interceptor with additional functionality, though this is quite heavy-handed and may lead to unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCurrent alternative is to use `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` and change the network setup to accommodate the limitation of only being able to map origins and not paths.

([Even the old v17 Tour of Heroes application used this pattern](https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt6#herodetailcomponent).) The responsibility falls on the component to handle making this call and handling not found exceptions (which increases the responsibility of the component), e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  details: Details | undefined;\r\n  \r\n  @Input()\r\n  set slug(slug: string) {\r\n    this.details = detailService.get(slug);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be ideal to treat these all as resolvers executed by the router and push the resolution and not-found logic up a level - namely by only allowing the route to match if the value could be resolved and otherwise falling back on the not-found component.\r\n\r\nThe minor issue today is that the matchers and resolvers are fully divorced - `CanMatchFn`s take in the route configuration and the url segments (and cannot inject the activated route since the route has not been activated) while `ResolveFn`s have access to the full activated route but cannot influence the route being matched. As such, we have to write our logic twice - get the data and check if it is present as a match guard and get the data and set it as data field as a resolver. Especially for simple applications, it would be ideal to only need to do this in one place (e.g. to prevent needing to cache data between the two calls to a service).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe only solution I can wrap my head around with the current framework would be to allow resolvers to return some placeholder symbol `DenyMatch` that would indicate to the router to prevent matching (much like how redirect commands can be returned). However, this solution likely has some deeper implications as the route is already activated at this point.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: ':slug',\r\n    component: DetailViewComponent,\r\n    resolve: {\r\n      details: (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => \r\n        detailService.get(route.params['slug']) ?? DenyMatch,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: '**',\r\n    component: NotFoundComponent,\r\n  }\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIt may also be possible to resolve structure this use case by resolving data in a parent route, but this approach doesn't work currently as each (child) component would still need to have a path defined and the matcher still cannot inject the activated route.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57071","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow for router resolvers to block route matching\" (#57071)"},{"Id":"2421612213","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-21T21:42:40","Actor":"ShahriarMalik","Number":"57070","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): pass appRoutes correctly to provideRouter","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI need to move the content of the host component into an external DOM element (created by a 3rd party library).\r\n\r\nSo the new content wrapper is not accessible until the 3rd party library generates it, only then the content of the host component should be moved into that new content wrapper. these content could be components such as `<mat-table>`.\r\n\r\nThe content is moved successfully to the new content wrapper and works properly, however, the problem is when the host component is destroyed, the content components don't seem to be destroyed! causing a memory leak.\r\n\r\nSee the attached video of the heap snapshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\nComponent template:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ng-content/>\r\n```\r\nComponent code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nngOnInit(): void {\r\n  // Move all content of the viewport into the content wrapper\r\n  const childNodes: ChildNode[] = Array.from(viewportElement.childNodes);\r\n  childNodes.forEach((node: ChildNode) => this.renderer.appendChild(contentWrapperElement, node));\r\n\r\n  // Append the content wrapper to the viewport\r\n  this.renderer.appendChild(viewportElement,

This is as expected during SSR.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\nIf I go to `http://localhost:4200/index.html`, I expect to get an html response which is exactly the index.html on disk, without the ssr transformation. But the dev server sends me a \"404 Not Found\" instead.\r\n\r\nTurns out that, for SSR, angular creates 2 index.html - `index.csr.html` and `index.server.html`. I am interested in the csr version, because I want to precache it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the angular dev server's middleware prevents me from accessing that file.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992adb0f-9f59-4813-9321-2bdd17d36eb0)\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of me debugging the dev-server. The request was for `/index.html`\r\n\r\nIn line 25, the middleware tries to search the outputFiles for 'index.html'. The problem is that the outputFile don't have 'index.html'. They have 'index.csr.html' and 'index.server.html'. As a result, `rawHtml` is going to be always be `undefined`, and the middleware is  going to go to line 27 and skip the middleware.\r\n\r\nIf I try to go for `/index.csr.html`, then the middleware will skip out before it even reaches Line 25, due to the `if` condition on Line 12\r\nLine 12 says that any request that are not '/' or '/index.html' will be ignored. \r\n\r\nSo we are perpetually denied being served the raw `index.html` while serving in SSR\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a new angular app\r\nAdd SSR to it as per the documentation\r\nAdd a lazy loaded component for the path `''` with the selector `test-element` and an empty template, \r\nRemove the contents of app.component's template and add a router outlet to app.component.html\r\nDo other task necessary to set up routing\r\nServe the app with ng serve\r\n\r\nGo to `http://localhost:4200` and check the response that came on first load. You should see the element `<test-element></test-element>` in the html. This is ok\r\n\r\nGo to `http://localhost:4200/index.html`. This should result in 404 Not Found. This is ok.\r\n\r\nGo to `http://localhost:4200/index.csr.html`. This should result in 404 Not Found. This is not ok. It should have returned html without the test-element in it.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.1.0\r\nNode: 20.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.4.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-luxon-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.1.0\r\nng-packagr                      18.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/f5c250ab48e22c5aff31d8ebd35fb9a88e380fd7/packages/angular/build/src/tools/vite/middlewares/index-html-middleware.ts#L30-L42\r\n\r\nThis is the part that likely needs to be changed. \r\n- change line 31 to allow  `index.csr.html`\r\n- change line 37 to search for `index.csr.html` or `index.html`  as per the actual request","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28063","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng serve does not allow us access to raw 'index.csr.html' when using SSR\" (#28063)"},{"Id":"2415797468","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-19T16:52:18","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): serve HTML files directly","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure direct requests to HTML files result in them being served.\r\n\r\nCloses #28063\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): serve HTML files directly\" (#28069)"},{"Id":"2419231677","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-19T15:38:46","Actor":"Mehdi-MST","Number":"28087","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use Node.js dependencies in server-only code","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nPackages like swagger-dist that uses path gives error on build.

The thing is I'm using web workers in my Angular app, and I have found some issues while deploying it.\r\n\r\nIn my service, I'm importing the web worker as the Angular doc says.\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nthis.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url), \r\n   {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nduring development (`ng serve`) it works as expected. \r\n\r\nBut when I build, I see in my dist folder a new file called `worker-<HASH>`\r\nI'm building with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild using this command:\r\n- `ng build --configuration=production --deploy-url \"https://${CLOUDFRONT_URL}/${VERSION}\"`\r\n\r\nCLOUDFRONT_URL is the URL of my AWS CDN.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is, that I'm not able to locate the file. Because \"import.meta.url\" is not the current URL I'm using for the web page.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n- Lets say that my page is hosted at www.mypage.com\r\n- My files are hosted on a cloudfront cdn, thus, files lives on s3, and I'm able to download it using the CLOUDFRONT_URL mentioned above. (that's why I'm using the --deploy-url param)\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I noted is that, when I do something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n// my typescript code\r\n\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nits gets transpiled to something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('worker-F4AB9Z', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Esbuild replaced the `../utils/workers/myworker.worker` with the compiled filename `worker-F4AB9Z`.\r\nBut it is not doing the same with any string other than \"import.meta.url\" for the URL of the new worker.\r\n\r\nIf I try to do something like\r\n``` typescript\r\nconst url = new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url)\r\n```\r\nI wont work. Esbuild will only replace the file path with the compiled filename if I put the `new URL( ... )` inside the Worker constructor. Is that expected?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.14\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAnother question: Is there any way that I could have the output filename ( the `worker-F4AB9Z` ) in a variable? \r\nBecause currently I'm manually deploying the web worker to s3 and hardcoding the URL in the code.\r\nBut as you may know, the hash of the file changes on every deploy, or at least when the worker code changes.

Just add `export HUSKY=0` to `.config/husky/init.sh`.\n\nI've seen some confusion about this on X, so just a heads-up!\n\n### Sponsoring\n\nHusky is downloaded over 45M times per month and used by ~1.5M projects.

The primary motivation for this change was to ensure that ARIA attributes were always rendered correctly on the server, where the emulated DOM may not correctly reflect ARIA properties as attributes. Furthermore, this change added support for binding to ARIA attributes using the property binding syntax (e.g. `[aria-label]`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62630 relied on the incorrect assumptions that an ARIA property name could be converted to its attribute name (without hardcoding the conversion), and that the value of an ARIA property matched its corresponding attribute. For example, the `ariaLabelledByElements` property's value is an array of DOM elements, while the corresponding `aria-labelledby` attribute's value is a string containing the IDs of the DOM elements.\r\n\r\nThis partially reverts https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62630 so that only property bindings with ARIA attribute names (begin with `aria-`) are converted to attribute bindings.\r\n\r\n* `[ariaLabel]` will revert to binding to the `ariaLabel` property.\r\n* `[aria-label]` will continue binding to the `aria-label` attribute.\r\n\r\nNote the only difference between `[aria-label]` and `[attr.aria-label]` is that the former will attempt to bind to inputs of the same name while the latter will not.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63925","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): do not rename ARIA property bindings to attributes\" (#63925)"},{"Id":"3429611695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T21:30:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"63904","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): capture metadata for undecorated fields","State":"closed","Body":"Currently if `TestBed.overrideComponent` is used on a class that uses initializer APIs (e.g. `input()`), the initializer metadata will be wiped out, because `overrideComponent` re-compiles the class with the information set by `setClassMetadata`. `setClassMetadata` only captures decorated members at the moment.\r\n\r\nThese changes introduce some logic to capture the new initializer-based APIs in `setClassMetadata` as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #57944.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63904","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler-cli): capture metadata for undecorated fields\" (#63904)"},{"Id":"3431166002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T20:15:34","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63922","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: re-add ai event banner on homepage","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63922","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: re-add ai event banner on homepage\" (#63922)"},{"Id":"3431672670","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T19:23:04","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"63924","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: migrate vscode extension into repo","State":"open","Body":"Migrate the vscode extension for angular into this repository.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63924","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: migrate vscode extension into repo\" (#63924)"},{"Id":"3431549831","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T18:44:58","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"63923","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): update to cldr 47","State":"open","Body":"Update to CLDR version 47 for localization\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63923","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): update to cldr 47\" (#63923)"},{"Id":"3431143337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T16:35:58","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"63921","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): prevent animations renderer from impacting `animate.leave`","State":"open","Body":"This bypasses the animation renderer when removing nodes that have `animate.leave` animations.

Breaking Changes\n\n- **Dropped support for Node.js < 18.0.0**.\n  Older Node.js version have reached end-of-life, and certain features require new-ish JS APIs.\n- **Pending commands no longer run when `--max-processes` is set and an interruption/kill signal is sent** - [#&#8203;433](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/433), [#&#8203;452](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/452), [#&#8203;460](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/460)\n  Before v9.0.0, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> when `--max-processes` is set meant that only those commands would receive it. Once these stopped, the pending commands would start, which in turn meant that another <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> press would be necessary to stop them, and so on.\n  Similar situation applied to combining `--max-processes` with `--kill-others`/`--kill-others-on-fail`.\n\n  Starting with v9.0.0, this no longer happens, as these flags and/or key presses send a signal to stop the running commands in addition to preventing new commands from running.\n- **The `concurrently` and default exports are now the same** - [#&#8203;399](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/399)\n  It's reasonable to expect that `import { concurrently } from 'concurrently'` would work the same as `import concurrently from 'concurrently'`, however this has not been the case.\n  The former used to be an unconfigured version of concurrently, lacking all features that you'd get from the CLI, which was seen as a \"footgun\". Both are now the same function.\n\n  If you'd like to access the unconfigured function, use `import { createConcurrently } from 'concurrently'` instead.\n\n##### ✨ New Features\n\n- Exponential back-off support for process restarting - [#&#8203;265](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/265), [#&#8203;462](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/462)\n  Use `--restart-after exponential`. Restarts happen at `2^N` seconds.\n- Add prefix padding via new `--pad-prefix` flag - [#&#8203;166](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/166), [#&#8203;417](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/417), [#&#8203;495](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/495)\n- Specify teardown commands via

`node:<script>` commands to `node --run <script>` - [#&#8203;475](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/475)\n- *\\[API only]* Inter-Process Communication (ipc) - [#&#8203;498](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/498)\n- *\\[API only]* Make it possible to use no colors at all -

does feature some small breaking changes, and maybe even fixes some longstanding bugs.\n\n##### Breaking changes\n\n- **The CLI option `--allow-restarts` is no more.**\n  Instead, just set `--restart-tries` to something greater than `0`.\n- **Input handling is now opt-in via `--handle-input` flag.** ([#&#8203;147](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/147))\\\n  It does come with some specific input parsing that would make it difficult for you to use it with some tools.\n- **Setting prefix to `none` will now actually not prefix commands' outputs.**\\\n  Previously, it would prefix with `[] `.\n- **`SIGINT`s/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> will now be handled gracefully.** ([#&#8203;150](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/150))\n  No more exiting with code `1` or tweaking `--success` flag.\n\n##### No more `null` exit codes ([#&#8203;133](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/133))\n\nThat's a pretty bad bug that existed till now. You won't see a log like this anymore:\n\n```\n[1] npm run lint-watch exited with code null\n```\n\nWhat you will see going forward is the **actual exit signal**:\n\n```\n[1] npm run lint-watch exited with code SIGTERM\n```\n\nFor Windows users, this will invariably still be exit code `1`.\n\n##### concurrently finally gets a shiny ✨ programmatic API!\n\nCloses [#&#8203;101](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/101), [#&#8203;112](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/112).

The issue #59257 and [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/1k1grot/weird_error_with_imports_after_upgrading_to/) both hint that the issue might be linked to circular dependencies. However, after running `madge` on my application and refactoring to remove the identified circular dependencies, the issue was still present.\n\n\nThe fix we found was to run the app with the `--no-hmr` flag, to disable HMR. By doing this hotfix, we were able to get the application running, but is not ideal for local development. \n\nIdeally we would like to find a solution in which we can use hot reload for local development.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ecmp')\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.1\nNode: 24.8.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.6.0\nOS: linux x64\n\n\nAngular: 20.3.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router\n\nPackage                            Version\n------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.2003.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      20.3.1\n@angular-devkit/core               20.3.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics         20.3.1\n@angular/cdk                       20.2.3\n@angular/cli                       20.3.1\n@angular/material                  20.2.3\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   20.2.3\n@schematics/angular                20.3.1\nrxjs                               7.8.2\ntypescript                         5.9.2\nzone.js                            0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63909","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HMR breaks after upgrade to Angular 19/20\" (#63909)"},{"Id":"3429667581","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T10:17:16","Actor":"hawkgs","Number":"63906","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): don't discard favorites in search history when reselected","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nDo not downgrade favorites to recent search results when you reselect them via the search results list.\r\n\r\nTBD: Would like to add a test but I am currently experiencing issues with the test suite.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63906","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): don't discard favorites in search history when reselected\" (#63906)"},{"Id":"3429657579","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T10:14:36","Actor":"haigha106","Number":"63905","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signal Forms incorrectly places mat-error in template","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n**using the new Signal Forms** \n\nwhen adding a `mat-error` component to a `mat-form-field` inside a @for loop and then an @if statement the `mat-error` is incorrectly placed\n\n<img width=\"372\" height=\"193\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eef86a7-f0d5-4856-b0de-0f0b22e5df26\" />\n\nas below\n\n<img width=\"546\" height=\"462\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/077c9494-7f00-41c7-bc2b-344cdcfd8d55\" />\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-mbrurxfu?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63905","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal Forms incorrectly places mat-error in template\" (#63905)"},{"Id":"3429534066","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T09:41:09","Actor":"zygarios","Number":"63903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature: add better support for migrations + gui","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nlanguage-service\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, Angular migrations are managed exclusively through the command line using the Angular CLI.

It was fixed by emitting the value `undefined` in this case, which avoids the panic. This case must be rare since it hasn't come up until now. Here is an example of code that previously triggered the panic (which only happened when minifying):\n\n  ```js\n  function identity(x) { return x }\n  identity({ y: identity(123) })\n  ```\n\n- Fix `@supports` nested inside pseudo-element ([#&#8203;4265](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4265))\n\n  When transforming nested CSS to non-nested CSS, esbuild is supposed to filter out pseudo-elements such as `::placeholder` for correctness. The [CSS nesting specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) says the following:\n\n  > The nesting selector cannot represent pseudo-elements (identical to the behavior of the ':is()' pseudo-class). We’d like to relax this restriction, but need to do so simultaneously for both ':is()' and '&', since they’re intentionally built on the same underlying mechanisms.\n\n  However, it seems like this behavior is different for nested at-rules such as `@supports`, which do work with pseudo-elements.

[`v21.0.0-next.4`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next4-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/21.0.0-next.3...21.0.0-next.4)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n- `ngComponentOutletContent` is now of type `Node[][] | undefined` instead of `any[][] | undefined`.\n\n##### core\n\n- Using a combination of `provideZoneChangeDetection`\n  while also removing ZoneJS polyfills will no longer result in the\n  internal scheduler being disabled. All Angular applications now\n  consistenly use the same scheduler, and those with the Zone change detection\n  provider include additional automatic scheduling behaviors based on\n  NgZone stabilization.\n- Angular no longer provides a change detection scheduler\n  for ZoneJS-based change detection by default. Add\n  `provideZoneChangeDetection` to the providers of your\n  `bootstrapApplication` function or your `AppModule` (if using\n  `bootstrapModule`). This provider addition will be covered by an\n  automated migration.\n- `moduleId` was removed from `Component` metadata.\n- The `interpolation` option on Components has been removed. Only the default `{{ ... }}` is now supported.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [7a4b225c57](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a4b225c57d8e390ec06731f5211d52d14da3a9c) | refactor | improve typing of `ngComponentOutletContent` ([#&#8203;63674](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63674)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [803dc8e44c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/803dc8e44c047ebccdfa5ce9ce6a450c6971a78b) | fix  | Add support for `aria-invalid` ([#&#8203;63748](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63748)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [89cf62f907](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/89cf62f907d28684d726d26fa4f12be23e8152ff) | fix  | only bind inputs that are part of microsyntax to a structural directive ([#&#8203;52453](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/52453))       |\n| [7fd3db0423](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7fd3db04232d63f1b48ec389bbb62d9ca277fcf9) | fix  | remove internal syntax-related flags ([#&#8203;63787](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63787))                                          |\n| [0a60e355e1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/0a60e355e1563051f1152efd46fe6a7daa3e5951) | fix  | signal not invoked diagnostic not raised when input has same name in template ([#&#8203;63754](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63754)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [809a4ed8c1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/809a4ed8c110ca930cb1c6bad309f8bfcaf7ceb8) | feat     | Add migration for zoneless by default.

We’re building a webhook from our CMS to trigger a pipeline, but ng build does not support selectively prerendering specific routes.\n\nThis forces us to:\n\n* Rebuild all pages unnecessarily\n* Waste build time and resources\n* Overwrite unchanged prerendered content\n\n\nThe closest workaround is using the low-level `@angular/ssg `API (e.g. via a custom `scripts/prerender-specific.ts`), but this is not viable in Angular v17–20 as the `@angular/ssg` package is not public yet.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/79670012/how-to-pre-render-specific-route-on-cli\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease provide a way to build/prerender only a specific subset of routes — for example:\n\n```\nng prerender --routes=/article/2025-new-post,/article/2024-old-post\n```\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Better integration with headless CMS/webhooks\n- Efficient incremental builds\n- Much faster deployment cycles\n- Avoids regenerating unchanged routes\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nexpose `@angular/ssg` API","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to Prerender Specific Routes Only via CLI or Build Options\" (#31221)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3429509055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T09:33:58","Actor":"PowerKiKi","Number":"31894","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/radio): Hovering over label of a radio will show the pointer cursor","State":"open","Body":"This is consistent with checkbox behavior.\r\n\r\nRadio used to work that way too until Angular Material v14. v15 broke it, and it remained broken until now.\r\n\r\nFixes #26067, at least partially\r\n\r\n<img width=\"234\" height=\"238\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d595958e-6ac3-462e-bd63-d06c20e47bf5\" />\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31894","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/radio): Hovering over label of a radio will show the pointer cursor\" (#31894)"},{"Id":"3428891572","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-18T06:45:07","Actor":"dinesh-lakshmanan-zeuslearning","Number":"31893","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Mat-Slider): Mat-slider is missing label fields.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhile using AXE tools we are getting issue - \"FORM ELEMENT MUST HAVE LABELS\".\nThis used to work until angular material 14 is there any specific reason this was removed?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

[`v21.0.0-next.4`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next4-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/21.0.0-next.3...21.0.0-next.4)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n- `ngComponentOutletContent` is now of type `Node[][] | undefined` instead of `any[][] | undefined`.\n\n##### core\n\n- Using a combination of `provideZoneChangeDetection`\n  while also removing ZoneJS polyfills will no longer result in the\n  internal scheduler being disabled. All Angular applications now\n  consistenly use the same scheduler, and those with the Zone change detection\n  provider include additional automatic scheduling behaviors based on\n  NgZone stabilization.\n- Angular no longer provides a change detection scheduler\n  for ZoneJS-based change detection by default. Add\n  `provideZoneChangeDetection` to the providers of your\n  `bootstrapApplication` function or your `AppModule` (if using\n  `bootstrapModule`). This provider addition will be covered by an\n  automated migration.\n- `moduleId` was removed from `Component` metadata.\n- The `interpolation` option on Components has been removed. Only the default `{{ ... }}` is now supported.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [7a4b225c57](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a4b225c57d8e390ec06731f5211d52d14da3a9c) | refactor | improve typing of `ngComponentOutletContent` ([#&#8203;63674](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63674)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [803dc8e44c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/803dc8e44c047ebccdfa5ce9ce6a450c6971a78b) | fix  | Add support for `aria-invalid` ([#&#8203;63748](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63748)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [89cf62f907](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/89cf62f907d28684d726d26fa4f12be23e8152ff) | fix  | only bind inputs that are part of microsyntax to a structural directive ([#&#8203;52453](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/52453))       |\n| [7fd3db0423](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7fd3db04232d63f1b48ec389bbb62d9ca277fcf9) | fix  | remove internal syntax-related flags ([#&#8203;63787](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63787))                                          |\n| [0a60e355e1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/0a60e355e1563051f1152efd46fe6a7daa3e5951) | fix  | signal not invoked diagnostic not raised when input has same name in template ([#&#8203;63754](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63754)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [809a4ed8c1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/809a4ed8c110ca930cb1c6bad309f8bfcaf7ceb8) | feat     | Add migration for zoneless by default.

Write more than 5 lines inside the textarea\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe textarea should scroll to the cursor, if the cursor would be outside of the viewport otherwise.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe textarea does not scroll automatically in Chrome browsers.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.4, 20.3.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.4, 20.2.3\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31874","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTextareaAutosize): AutoResize doesn't scroll to cursor on Chrome\" (#31874)"},{"Id":"3420668421","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T06:34:59","Actor":"PowerKiKi","Number":"31873","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(dialog): Typing of new `MatDialogConfig.closePredicate`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n#30919 introduced the new MatDialog config `closePredicate`. I am struggling to make typing work to have a 100% typed code.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/9wtzaa17?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. open link, it does not compile, but I expect to compile\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAt first I expected that types would be flowing, so that I wouldn't need to repeat them. So my expected usage would be like:\n\n```ts\nthis.dialog.open<MyDialog, MyDialogData, MyDialogResult>(\n  MyDialog,\n  {\n    closePredicate: (\n      result,\n      config,\n      componentInstance\n    ) => {\n      return something();\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nBut that failed to compile. So I tried to add typing like so:\n\n```ts\nthis.dialog.open<MyDialog, MyDialogData, MyDialogResult>(\n  MyDialog,\n  {\n    closePredicate: (\n      result: MyDialogResult | undefined,\n      config: MatDialogConfig<MyDialogData>,\n      componentInstance: MyDialog | null\n    ) => {\n      return componentInstance?.animal() !== 'my original data';\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThat also fail to compile. And I am out of ideas.\n\nAngular Material source never use this callback with any parameters (neither in implementation, nor in tests).\n\nWhat is the expected usage pattern here ? Is there a way to avoid repetition ?\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nStackblitz does not compile\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1\n- CDK/Material: 20.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- TypeScript: 5.8.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31873","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): Typing of new `MatDialogConfig.closePredicate`\" (#31873)"},{"Id":"3419668249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T22:06:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31872","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox","State":"open","Body":"* Create the Combobox UI Pattern class\r\n* Create the CdkCombobox, CdkComboboxInput, CdkComboboxPopupContent, and CdkComboboxPopup directives\r\n* Create 3 component examples.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31872","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox\" (#31872)"},{"Id":"3418265211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T14:37:40","Actor":"BUONJG","Number":"31871","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CdkTextareaAutosize): Textarea does not scroll to active line","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\n\nIs there currently a solution or planned fix for this issue?\n\nAs described in [issue 30841](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30841)\n, when using the textarea with cdkTextareaAutosize, the component does not automatically scroll to keep the cursor in view once the content exceeds the maxRows.

The exact version (and checksum) is saved in the lockfile.\n  3. Scripts use the local runtime, ensuring consistency across environments.\n\n  Why this is better:\n\n  1. This new setting supports also Deno and Bun (vs. our Node-only settings `useNodeVersion` and `executionEnv.nodeVersion`)\n  2. Supports version ranges (not just a fixed version).\n  3. The resolved version is stored in the pnpm lockfile, along with an integrity checksum for future validation of the Node.js content's validity.\n  4. It can be used on any workspace project (like `executionEnv.nodeVersion`). So, different projects in a workspace can use different runtimes.\n  5. For now `devEngines.runtime` setting will install the runtime locally, which we will improve in future versions of pnpm by using a shared location on the computer.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;9755](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9755).\n\n- Add `--cpu`, `--libc`, and `--os` to `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, and `pnpm dlx` to customize `supportedArchitectures` via the CLI [#&#8203;7510](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7510).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix a bug in which `pnpm add` downloads packages whose `libc` differ from `pnpm.supportedArchitectures.libc`.\n- The integrities of the downloaded Node.js artifacts are verified [#&#8203;9750](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9750).\n- Allow `dlx` to parse CLI flags and options between the `dlx` command and the command to run or between the `dlx` command and `--` [#&#8203;9719](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9719).\n- `pnpm install --prod` should removing hoisted dev dependencies [#&#8203;9782](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9782).\n- Fix an edge case bug causing local tarballs to not re-link into the virtual store.

The `assertIsError` utility is more robust, and a type-related bug in workspace configuration validation has been fixed.

Now that we have `animate.leave` in the framework, the aggressive pruning has the unintended side effect of removing the stylesheet that contains the defined animation styles. This ends up causing a weird behavior with the delayed element removal, styles disappearing, and then the element failing to be removed until the timeout fires. This can be solved by disabling the behavior with the `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` injection token. However, that's not ideal given that it leaves all stylesheets behind.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe ideal solution would be to delay the pruning of the stylesheets by the duration of the animation timeout and then prune them after. This essentially allows the animation to fire properly, leave the element looking right, and then remove. Alternatively, we could just always schedule pruning to happen a given duration after destroy.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` token is the only current workaround.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30820","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Delayed Stylesheet Pruning when animate.leave exists\" (#30820)"},{"Id":"3282574171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-01T07:09:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30817","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v5.9.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.8.3` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | resolutions | patch | [`5.9.1-rc` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.9.1-rc` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>microsoft/TypeScript (typescript)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.2`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v5.9.2): TypeScript 5.9\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/compare/ad825f2bee3362886d642c48cb97c82df82b3ddb...v5.9.2)\n\nRelease notes pending.\n\n<!-- For release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-9-rc/) -->\n\n- [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.9.0 (Beta)](https://redirect.github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.9.0%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n- [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.9.1 (RC)](https://redirect.github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.9.1%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n- \\[\\[No specific changes for TypeScript 5.9.2 (Stable)]]\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The removal of the unified Tailwind detection system and introduction of PostCSS config discovery created an ecosystem compatibility gap.\n\nThis isn't a request to fix third-party tools, but rather:\n- Documentation request: How should build system integrators adapt to v21 changes?\n- Ecosystem impact awareness: Significant breaking change affecting Angular + Bazel projects\n- Migration guidance: What's the recommended integration pattern for the new PostCSS system?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. setup a new angular project with tailwind\n2. add tailwind directive\n3. configure bazel\n4. compare styles.css from `ng build --configuration production` vs `bazel build //:web-app-build`\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNo runtime errors, but silently broken functionality. \ntailwind are not processed\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: v21.0.0+\nNode.js: v22.12.0\nBazel: Latest with Aspect Rules JS\nTailwind CSS: v3.3.5\nPostCSS: v8.5.6\nOS: Linux 6.8.0-64-generic\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\nThe v21 changes introduced two new systems that third-party build tools don't implement - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/49a09737d5412c302d09b40de198251bb99789d1\n1. PostCSS Config Discovery - Searches for postcss.config.json, .postcssrc.json\n2. Modified Automatic Detection - New fallback logic when no config found\n\nEvidence from Investigation:\n✅ File discovery works: Bazel finds tailwind.config.js\n✅ Dependencies available: All PostCSS/Tailwind packages present\n✅ Same execution environment: Verified via sandbox debugging\n❌ Processing pipeline broken: Third-party tools missing new integration logic\n\nImpact on Ecosystem:\n- Affects all Angular projects using Bazel builds with Tailwind\n- Creates build system inconsistency (same code, different output)\n- No migration documentation exists for build system integrators\n- Forces workaround of using only ng build\n\nRequests for Angular CLI Team:\n📚 Documentation: How should third-party build systems implement the new PostCSS discovery?\n🛠️ Migration Guide: What's the recommended integration pattern for build tools?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30802","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI v20.1 PostCSS Integration Changes Break Third-Party Build Systems - Need Migration Guidance\" (#30802)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3286838575","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T20:09:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31638","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: enable stricter checking of inputs and outputs","State":"closed","Body":"Enables flags for stricter type checking of inputs and outputs, as well as a flag that will prevent us from declaring private/protected inputs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31638","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: enable stricter checking of inputs and outputs\" (#31638)"},{"Id":"3287138346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T12:37:08","Actor":"8x6d3jk2","Number":"31640","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker/select): Chrome DevTools issues","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\ndatepicker (range) component reports in Chrome DevTools issue:\nA form field element should have an id or name attribute.\nsee #29749\n\nmat-select component reports in Chrome DevTools issue:\nNo label associated with a form field.\n\n### Reproduction\n\ndatepicker:\n1. https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/overview\n2. open Chrome DevTools (F12) -> Issues tab\n\nmat-select:\n1. https://material.angular.dev/components/select/overview\n2. open Chrome DevTools (F12) -> Issues tab\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nmessages are self-explanatory\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmessages are self-explanatory\n\n### Environment\n\nangular material 20.1.4\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31640","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker/select): Chrome DevTools issues\" (#31640)"},{"Id":"3287044312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T10:14:03","Actor":"bobah2000","Number":"31639","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/tabs): Change Detection for tab content that lazy loaded does not works","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n16\n\n### Description\n\nIf tab content is lazy loaded by declaring the body in a ng-template with the matTabContent attribute then Change Detection in this content does not works as expected.\nAt the same time if exactly this content is earer loaded, then Change Detection work fine.\nProblem occurs only when in tab content used traditional data binding.

I then created a few basic components, one of which contained a mat-paginator. By navigating between the components, I observed that the number of detached mat-option elements increased. Additionally, the component containing the mat-paginator was not fully removed from the DOM, even after a significant amount of time.\n\nThis issue became particularly noticeable in a real-world project with actual product cards data. In the scenarios described above, memory usage increased significantly over time. However, when the mat-paginator was removed from the component, all unused nodes were properly released, and memory consumption remained stable.\n\n<!-- Failed to upload \"4.mp4\" -->\n<img width=\"2113\" height=\"1261\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edfce44d-5dab-4d70-8409-57384b06be6b\" />\n<img width=\"2043\" height=\"1322\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e06382-e79b-40a7-9d23-9e59ac613a59\" />\n<img width=\"1837\" height=\"1327\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff4e7f91-6663-469d-b1a4-45bafea6d642\" />\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNavigating between components should properly clean up all associated DOM elements and Angular components. Specifically:\n- Components containing mat-paginator should be fully destroyed and removed from the DOM when navigated away from.\n- Detached elements such as mat-option should not accumulate in memory over time.\n- No memory leaks or unintended DOM retention should occur during standard component lifecycle transitions.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe above-described interaction between components should not result in the accumulation of an excessive number of unused nodes. This behavior suggests a potential memory leak, as elements such as mat-option and components with mat-paginator are not being properly destroyed or garbage collected upon navigation.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\nAngular CLI: 20.0.5\nNode: 22.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\n- CDK/Material: \"^20.1.4\",\n- Browser(s): Chrome 138.0.7204.170,\n- Operating System: Windows 11,\n\n- Dependencies:\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^20.1.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/build\": \"^20.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^20.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^20.0.0\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~5.7.0\",\n    \"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~2.1.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.8.2\"\n  }\n\nI also encountered this problem on an Angular project with the following dependencies:\n \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.2.11\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/platform-server\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/pwa\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.2.10\",\n    \"@angular/ssr\": \"^19.2.8\",\n    \"@auth0/angular-jwt\": \"^5.2.0\",\n    \"@fixAR496/ngx-elly-lib\": \"^0.0.11\",\n    \"@ngrx/effects\": \"^19.1.0\",\n    \"@ngrx/operators\": \"^19.1.0\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^19.1.0\",\n    \"@rx-angular/cdk\": \"^19.1.0\",\n    \"@rx-angular/template\": \"^19.2.1\",\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.15.0\"\n  },","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31637","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatPaginator): Memory leak when using mat-paginator\" (#31637)"},{"Id":"3285602501","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-02T11:29:33","Actor":"wbreakell","Number":"31635","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: correct grammatical errors in custom stepper guide","State":"closed","Body":"This fixes grammatical errors and improves phrasing for better readability.

A chip has two slots to display icons using content projection. All variants of chips support adding icons including \\<mat-chip\\>, \\<mat-chip-option\\>, and \\<mat-chip-row\\>.\n\nThis suggests two possible slots for a `<mat-icon>` (leading or trailing the chip text). However, this doesn't work in practice, and looking at the [template code](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/chips/chip.html) suggests that the chip only supports an _avatar_ in the leading slot (despite the documentation stating \"icon\"). \n\nWhen you try to add an icon rather than an avatar, it's not aligned correctly. Adding the `matChipAvatar` directive doesn't help as the icon is clipped to a circle (and the alignment is still off).\n\nIn my opinion, a chip should support projecting an instance of `MatIcon` on the leading side (in fact, it's show in the [MD spec](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview)). However, as it stands the documentation is misleading as to the current behaviour.\n\n<img width=\"1360\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d002fc-7331-411d-97f4-8a918d063691\" />\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/gqzwx38r?file=src%2Fexample%2Fchips-avatar-example.html\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/chips/overview#adding-up-to-two-icons-with-content-projection","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): MatChip does not natively support leading icon despite docs\" (#31628)"},{"Id":"3279142506","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T05:09:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31626","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency firebase-tools to v14.11.2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [firebase-tools](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | devDependencies | patch | [`14.11.1` -> `14.11.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/14.11.1/14.11.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.11.2`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.11.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.11.1...v14.11.2)\n\n- Fixed ext:export command so that it correctly returns system params in the .env file ([#&#8203;8881](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/8881))\n- Fixed an issue where the MCP server could not successfully use Application Default Credentials.

The problem with this approach is that depending on the user's screen and zoom level, there can be rendering artifacts on Windows like a dot in the middle of the radio button.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the rendering artifacts by using a background color for the circle and which is overridden to `CanvasText` for high contrast mode.\r\n\r\nFixes #31466.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31612","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/radio): rendering artifacts at some zoom levels\" (#31612)"},{"Id":"3274374334","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-29T17:10:12","Actor":"lelandjordon","Number":"31614","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-autocomplete): when no backdropClass is set, defaults to cdk-overlay-dark-backdrop instead of cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nConsidering this as a followup to https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30457\n\nmat-select defaults to setting its overlay backdrop with the class \"cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop\", rendering a fully transparent overlay div to handle clicks outside the mat-select dropdown.\n\nmat-autocomplete, however, ends up with a default of \"cdk-overlay-dark-backdrop\", rendering a translucent gray overlay div.\n\nThis behavior feels inconsistent (if it was done by design, I would like to know why).\n\nIt also means that we have to make accommodations in our code specifically for mat-autocomplete, using a provider like this to set values for both hasBackdrop _and_ backdropClass, while we do not need to do anything special for mat-select:\n\n  ```\n  providers: [\n        {provide: MAT_AUTOCOMPLETE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n          useValue: { hasBackdrop: true, backdropClass: 'cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop-or-any-value-you-want' } \n        }\n    ],\n```\n\nOne of my colleagues traced it through these steps in the code:\n\nThis is the line where MatAutocomplete copies \"backdropClass\" to the \"OverlayConfig\"... which if you don't specify will be \"undefined\".\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/57adabce179149d1671edddda15787f6be6c6317/src/material/autocomplete/autocomplete-trigger.ts#L915\n\nAnd here is the line in \"OverlayConfig\" class that defaults the \"backdropClass\" to \"cdk-overlay-dark-backdrop\"\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/57adabce179149d1671edddda15787f6be6c6317/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-config.ts#L28\n\nAnd here is the \"OverlayConfig\" copy constructor, note that it ignores any passed in \"undefined\" property values, so if you don't specify you end up with \"cdk-overlay-dark-backdrop\"\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/57adabce179149d1671edddda15787f6be6c6317/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-config.ts#L72\n\nAnd just for completeness... the code where \"MatSelect\" hardcodes the \"backdropClass\" to \"cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop\"\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/57adabce179149d1671edddda15787f6be6c6317/src/material/select/select.html#L35\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-vmwlhjb4?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the field labeled Autocomplete and notice the gray overlay.\n2. Open the field labeled Mat-Select and notice that the overlay is transparent.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpecting mat-autocomplete to render the same style of backdrop-overlay as mat-select by default unless we specify otherwise.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-autocomplete renders a translucent gray backdrop-overlay rather than transparent as mat-select does.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19+\n- CDK/Material: 19+\n- Browser(s): Chrome (others not tested)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Win11 (others not tested)\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31614","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-autocomplete): when no backdropClass is set, defaults to cdk-overlay-dark-backdrop instead of cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop\" (#31614)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-08-04T03:30:02.9091383Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2139}

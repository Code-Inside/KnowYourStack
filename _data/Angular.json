Time to Interactive (TTI) no longer contributes to the performance score and is not displayed in the report. However, it is still accessible in the Lighthouse result JSON.\n\nWithout TTI, the weighting of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) has increased from 15% to 25%. See the docs for a complete breakdown of [how the Performance score is calculated in 10.0](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10), or [play with the scoring calculator](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/scorecalc/#FCP=3000\\&SI=5800\\&FMP=4000\\&TTI=7300\\&FCI=6500\\&LCP=4000\\&TBT=600\\&CLS=0.25\\&device=mobile\\&version=10\\&version=8).\n\n##### Types for the Node package\n\nLighthouse now includes type declarations! Our [example TypeScript recipe](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/main/docs/recipes/type-checking) demonstrates how to achieve proper type safety with Lighthouse.\n\n##### Third-party Entity classification\n\nSince Lighthouse 5.3, the community-driven [`third-party-web`](https://togithub.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) dataset has been used to summarize how every third-party found on a page contributes to the total JavaScript blocking time, via the `third-party-summary` audit. With Lighthouse 10.0, we are adding a new property to the JSON result (`entities`) to make further use of this dataset. Every origin encountered on a page is now classified as first-party or third-party within `entities`. In 10.0, this classification is used to power the existing third-party filter checkbox.\n\nIn a future version of Lighthouse, this will be used to group the table items of every audit based on the entity it originated from, and aggregate the impact of items from that specific entity.\n\n#### 🆕 New Audits\n\n##### Back/forward cache\n\nThe Back/forward cache (bfcache for short) is a browser optimization that serves pages from fully serialized snapshots when navigating back or forwards in session history. There are over 100 different reasons why a page may not be eligible for this optimization, so to assist developers Lighthouse now attempts to trigger a bfcache response and will list anything that prevented the browser from using the bfcache. [#&#8203;14465](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14465)\n\nFor more on bfcache, see [the web.dev article](https://web.dev/bfcache/).\n\nNote: This audit initially will not be available for PageSpeed Insights.\n\n##### Preventing pasting to inputs\n\nThe audit `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` is now `paste-preventing-inputs`. This audit's logic works just as before, but rather than just considering `[type=password]` inputs, it now fails if *any* non-readonly input element prevents the user from pasting. [#&#8203;14313](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14313)\n\n#### Lighthouse documentation is now on developer.chrome.com\n\nOur documentation is no longer hosted on web.dev. For the most up to date audit docs, please go to [developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)\n\n#### 💥 Breaking changes\n\nUnder the hood, Lighthouse now uses the new user-flow supporting infrastructure by default, even for traditional navigation runs. You can opt out of this by: in the CLI, use `--legacy-navigation`; in DevTools: check “Legacy Navigation” in the settings menu. If you have a use case that necessitates this escape hatch, please file an issue. We plan to remove this legacy path in 11.0.\n\n##### For Lighthouse result JSON (LHR) users\n\n##### Page URLs on the Lighthouse Result\n\nUntil now, there were two URL fields to describe a Lighthouse run:\n\n-   `requestedUrl`: the url given by the users, which Lighthouse instructs Chrome to navigate to\n-   `finalUrl`: the url after any server-initiated HTTP and JS-initiated redirects\n\nThis taxonomy cannot account for more complex scenarios, such as JS-initiated redirects, usage of the History API or soft-navigations. They were also ill-defined for timespan and snapshot modes. To account for that, Lighthouse 10.0 now has these URL fields:\n\n-   (changed) `requestedUrl`: The URL that Lighthouse initially navigated to before redirects. This is the same as it was before for navigation mode, but now it will be `undefined` in timespan/snapshot.\n-   (new) `mainDocumentUrl`: The URL of the last document requested during a navigation. It does not account for soft navigations or history API events made after the page loads. It is only available in navigation mode, and will be undefined in timespan and snapshot modes.\n-   (new) `finalDisplayedUrl`: The URL displayed in the browser combobox at the end of a Lighthouse run. It accounts for soft navigations and history API events. Available in navigation, timespan, and snapshot modes.\n-   (deprecated) `finalUrl`: Same value as `mainDocumentUrl`.\n\n##### Audit changes\n\n-   `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` -> `paste-preventing-inputs`\n-   `preload-lcp-image` -> `prioritize-lcp-image`\n-   `third-party-summary` no longer uses a `link` value for `item.entity`, instead uses a raw `text` value\n-   `full-page-screenshot` is no longer an audit, instead it is stored at `lhr.fullPageScreenshot`. To suppress collection of the full-page screenshot in the CLI, you must migrate from `--skip-audits full-page-screenshot` to `--disable-full-page-screenshot`.\n\n##### For Node users\n\n-   Node 14 is no longer supported, the minimum is now Node 16\n-   In case you import paths within the lighthouse node package: `lighthouse-core/` and `lighthouse-cli/` folders are now simply `core/` and `cli/`\n-   Converted from CommonJS to ES modules. You can still use lighthouse in CommonJS by using an dynamic import: `await import('lighthouse')`. For access to just the `lighthouse` function in CommonJS, you can also use `require('lighthouse/core/index.cjs')`\n-   The CSV output for Lighthouse is much more useful now. Consult the PR for [an example of the new format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13558)\n-   `LHError` is now `LighthouseError`. If you are attempting to catch an error thrown by Lighthouse, be sure to account for this!\n\n##### Node API changes\n\nThe `lighthouse` function now has [better integration with Puppeteer](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/puppeteer.md). Use `lighthouse(url, flags, config, page)` to run Lighthouse, passing an existing `Puppeteer.Page` handle as `page`.\n\nThe user flow api has moved to the top level node entrypoint and can be imported with `import {startFlow} from 'lighthouse'`.\n\nNew `flow.startNavigation()` and `flow.endNavigation()` functions let you define a user triggered navigation without any callback function. See the user flow docs for [an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/user-flows.md#triggering-a-navigation-via-user-interactions).\n\nTo change settings for a single user flow step, define the settings overrides on the toplevel flags options `flow.snapshot({skipAduits: ['uses-http2']})` instead of on the `settingsOverride` property.\n\nTo give a flow step a custom name, use `flow.snapshot({name: 'Custom name'})`. Previously this was done via `stepName`.\n\n##### For Lighthouse customization (custom config, gatherers, audits)\n\n-   To work in Lighthouse 10.0, custom gatherers will need to implement the new Gatherer interface ([an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/recipes/custom-audit/memory-gatherer.js)). Otherwise, they will only work in [legacy navigation mode](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#using-legacy-configs-in-100) and older versions of Lighthouse\n-   Lighthouse cannot use `passes` to load the page multiple times in navigation mode anymore. If you need to load the page multiple times, we recommend using a user flow. See our config docs for instructions on [how to convert to the new config format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#legacy-configs)\n-   The `ScriptElements` artifact is now `Scripts`, with a [slightly different shape](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/955586c4e05d501d69a79d4ef0297991b6805690/types/artifacts.d.ts#L317)\n-   `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails` and `Audit.makeTableDetails` now accept an options object as the third parameter. This ends up being a breaking change for just `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

So `opera_mobile` target was renamed to **`opera-android`**.\n    -   `android` target name is also confusing for someone - that means Android WebView, some think thinks that it's Chrome for Android, but they have some differences. For avoiding confusion, added **`chrome-android`** target.\n    -   For consistency with two previous cases, added **`firefox-android`** target.\n    -   For avoiding breaking changes, the `oculus` and `opera_mobile` fields are available in the compat data till the next major release.\n-   Compat data improvements:\n    -

For example, `%TypedArray%.prototype.groupBy` was removed from the `Array` grouping proposal a long time ago. We can't completely remove this method since it's a breaking change.

That mean that if the output contains, for example, `es.object.has-own`, the legacy reference to it, `esnext.object.has-own`, no longer added.\n    -   Aligned modules filters of [`core-js-builder`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-builder) and [`core-js-compat`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-compat), now it's `modules` and `exclude` options\n    -   Added support of entry points, modules, regexes, and arrays of them to those filters\n    -   Missed `targets` option of `core-js-compat` means that the `targets` filter just will not be applied, so the result will contain modules required for all possible engines\n-   Compat data:\n    -   `.stack` property on `DOMException` marked as supported from Deno [1.15](https://togithub.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.15.0)\n    -   Added Deno 1.21 compat data mapping\n    -   Added Electron 19.0 and updated 18.0 compat data mapping\n    -

If the requested path doesn't match any in-memory build result, esbuild also provides the `--servedir=` option to tell esbuild to serve the requested path from that directory instead. And if the requested path doesn't match either of those things, esbuild will either automatically generate a directory listing (for directories) or return a 404 error.\n\n    Starting with this release, that last step can now be replaced with telling esbuild to serve a specific HTML file using the `--serve-fallback=` option. This can be used to provide a \"not found\" page for missing URLs. It can also be used to implement a [single-page app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that mutates the current URL and therefore requires the single app entry point to be served when the page is loaded regardless of whatever the current URL is.\n\n-   Use the `tsconfig` field in `package.json` during `extends` resolution ([#&#8203;3247](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3247))\n\n    This release adds a feature from [TypeScript 3.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages) where if a `tsconfig.json` file specifies a package name in the `extends` field and that package's `package.json` file has a `tsconfig` field, the contents of that field are used in the search for the base `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n-   Implement CSS nesting without `:is()` when possible ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Previously esbuild would always produce a warning when transforming nested CSS for a browser that doesn't support the `:is()` pseudo-class. This was because the nesting transform needs to generate an `:is()` in some complex cases which means the transformed CSS would then not work in that browser. However, the CSS nesting transform can often be done without generating an `:is()`. So with this release, esbuild will no longer warn when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()` in the cases where an `:is()` isn't needed to represent the nested CSS.\n\n    In addition, esbuild's nested CSS transform has been updated to avoid generating an `:is()` in cases where an `:is()` is preferable but there's a longer alternative that is also equivalent. This update means esbuild can now generate a combinatorial explosion of CSS for complex CSS nesting syntax when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()`. This combinatorial explosion is necessary to accurately represent the original semantics. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .first,\n    .second,\n    .third {\n      & > & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    :is(.first, .second, .third) > :is(.first, .second, .third) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .first > .first,\n    .first > .second,\n    .first > .third,\n    .second > .first,\n    .second > .second,\n    .second > .third,\n    .third > .first,\n    .third > .second,\n    .third > .third {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This change means you can now use CSS nesting with esbuild when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`. You'll now only get a warning from esbuild if you use complex CSS nesting syntax that esbuild can't represent in that older browser without using `:is()`. There are two such cases:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    a b {\n      .foo & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a {\n      > b& {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    These two cases still need to use `:is()`, both for different reasons, and cannot be used when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    .foo :is(a b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a > a:is(b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically lower `inset` in CSS for older browsers\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically expand the `inset` property to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties when esbuild's `target` is set to a browser that doesn't support `inset`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 10px;\n      right: 20px;\n      bottom: 10px;\n      left: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add support for the new [`@starting-style`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/#defining-before-change-style-the-starting-style-rule) CSS rule ([#&#8203;3249](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3249))\n\n    This at rule allow authors to start CSS transitions on first style update. That is, you can now make the transition take effect when the `display` property changes from `none` to `block`.\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;starting-style {\n      h1 {\n        background-color: transparent;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Output */\n    @&#8203;starting-style{h1{background-color:transparent}}\n    ```\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://togithub.com/yisibl).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.64.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1640)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.63.6...1.64.0)\n\n-   Comments that appear before or between `@use` and `@forward` rules are now\n    emitted in source order as much as possible, instead of always being emitted\n    after the CSS of all module dependencies.\n\n-   Fix a bug where an interpolation in a custom property name crashed if the file\n    was loaded by a `@use` nested in an `@import`.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Add a new `SassCalculation` type that represents the calculation objects added\n    in Dart Sass 1.40.0.\n\n-   Add `Value.assertCalculation()`, which returns the value if it's a\n    `SassCalculation` and throws an error otherwise.\n\n-   Produce a better error message when an environment that supports some Node.js\n    APIs loads the browser entrypoint but attempts to access the filesystem.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Fix a bug where nested relative `@imports` failed to load when using the\n    deprecated functions `render` or `renderSync` and those relative imports were\n    loaded multiple times across different files.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.4.5`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small445-2023-07-20-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v4.4.4...v4.4.5)\n\n-   fix: \"EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, realpath\" error on RA… ([#&#8203;13655](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13655)) ([6bd5434](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6bd5434)), closes [#&#8203;13655](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13655)\n-   fix: transform error message add file info ([#&#8203;13687](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13687)) ([6dca41c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6dca41c)), closes [#&#8203;13687](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13687)\n-   fix: warn when publicDir and outDir are nested ([#&#8203;13742](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13742)) ([4eb3154](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4eb3154)), closes [#&#8203;13742](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13742)\n-   fix(build): remove warning about ineffective dynamic import from node_modules ([#&#8203;13884](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13884)) ([33002dd](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/33002dd)), closes [#&#8203;13884](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13884)\n-   fix(build): style insert order for UMD builds (fix [#&#8203;13668](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13668)) ([#&#8203;13669](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13669)) ([49a1b99](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/49a1b99)), closes [#&#8203;13668](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13668) [#&#8203;13669](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13669)\n-   fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;13872](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13872)) ([975a631](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/975a631)), closes [#&#8203;13872](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13872)\n-   fix(types): narrow down the return type of `defineConfig` ([#&#8203;13792](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13792)) ([c971f26](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/c971f26)), closes [#&#8203;13792](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13792)\n-   chore: fix typos ([#&#8203;13862](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13862)) ([f54e8da](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/f54e8da)), closes [#&#8203;13862](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13862)\n-   chore: replace `any` with `string` ([#&#8203;13850](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13850)) ([4606fd8](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4606fd8)), closes [#&#8203;13850](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13850)\n-   chore(deps): update dependency prettier to v3 ([#&#8203;13759](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13759)) ([5a56941](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/5a56941)), closes [#&#8203;13759](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13759)\n-   docs: fix build.cssMinify link ([#&#8203;13840](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13840)) ([8a2a3e1](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/8a2a3e1)), closes [#&#8203;13840](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13840)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

But it can take a bit to clean up a misspelling higher closer to the root in deeply nested paths. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhat feels like a fairly simple solution to this would be to lightly highlight any path segments that are going to be creating a new folder. This way the user can see if the folders being created match what they expect. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nCurrently the workaround is to type very slowly and carefully check every letter on deeply nested paths or navigate around the full structure of the application and run the command at the closest point to where the files will be generated.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.13...v0.18.14)\n\n-   Implement local CSS names ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release introduces two new loaders called `global-css` and `local-css` and two new pseudo-class selectors `:local()` and `:global()`. This is a partial implementation of the popular [CSS modules](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules) approach for avoiding unintentional name collisions in CSS. I'm not calling this feature \"CSS modules\" because although some people in the community call it that, other people in the community have started using \"CSS modules\" to refer to [something completely different](https://togithub.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/60c9f682b63c622bfa0d8222ea6b1f3b659e007c/proposals/css-modules-v1-explainer.md) and now CSS modules is an overloaded term.\n\n    Here's how this new local CSS name feature works with esbuild:\n\n    -   Identifiers that look like `.className` and `#idName` are global with the `global-css` loader and local with the `local-css` loader. Global identifiers are the same across all files (the way CSS normally works) but local identifiers are different between different files. If two separate CSS files use the same local identifier `.button`, esbuild will automatically rename one of them so that they don't collide. This is analogous to how esbuild automatically renames JS local variables with the same name in separate JS files to avoid name collisions.\n\n    -   It only makes sense to use local CSS names with esbuild when you are also using esbuild's bundler to bundle JS files that import CSS files. When you do that, esbuild will generate one export for each local name in the CSS file. The JS code can import these names and use them when constructing HTML DOM. For example:\n\n        ```js\n        // app.js\n        import { outerShell } from './app.css'\n        const div = document.createElement('div')\n        div.className = outerShell\n        document.body.appendChild(div)\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* app.css */\n        .outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        When you bundle this with `esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.css=local-css --outdir=out` you'll now get this (notice how the local CSS name `outerShell` has been renamed):\n\n        ```js\n        // out/app.js\n        (() => {\n          // app.css\n          var outerShell = \"app_outerShell\";\n\n          // app.js\n          var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n          div.className = outerShell;\n          document.body.appendChild(div);\n        })();\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* out/app.css */\n        .app_outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        This feature only makes sense to use when bundling is enabled both because your code needs to `import` the renamed local names so that it can use them, and because esbuild needs to be able to process all CSS files containing local names in a single bundling operation so that it can successfully rename conflicting local names to avoid collisions.\n\n    -   If you are in a global CSS file (with the `global-css` loader) you can create a local name using `:local()`, and if you are in a local CSS file (with the `local-css` loader) you can create a global name with `:global()`. So the choice of the `global-css` loader vs. the `local-css` loader just sets the default behavior for identifiers, but you can override it on a case-by-case basis as necessary. For example:\n\n        ```css\n        :local(.button) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        :global(.button) {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Processing this CSS file with esbuild with either the `global-css` or `local-css` loader will result in something like this:\n\n        ```css\n        .stdin_button {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        .button {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   The names that esbuild generates for local CSS names are an implementation detail and are not intended to be hard-coded anywhere. The only way you should be referencing the local CSS names in your JS or HTML is with an `import` statement in JS that is bundled with esbuild, as demonstrated above. For example, when `--minify` is enabled esbuild will use a different name generation algorithm which generates names that are as short as possible (analogous to how esbuild minifies local identifiers in JS).\n\n    -   You can easily use both global CSS files and local CSS files simultaneously if you give them different file extensions. For example, you could pass `--loader:.css=global-css` and `--loader:.module.css=local-css` to esbuild so that `.css` files still use global names by default but `.module.css` files use local names by default.\n\n    -   Keep in mind that the `css` loader is different than the `global-css` loader. The `:local` and `:global` annotations are not enabled with the `css` loader and will be passed through unchanged. This allows you to have the option of using esbuild to process CSS containing while preserving these annotations. It also means that local CSS names are disabled by default for now (since the `css` loader is currently the default for CSS files). The `:local` and `:global` syntax may be enabled by default in a future release.\n\n    Note that esbuild's implementation does not currently have feature parity with other implementations of modular CSS in similar tools. This is only a preliminary release with a partial implementation that includes some basic behavior to get the process started. Additional behavior may be added in future releases. In particular, this release does not implement:\n\n    -   The `composes` pragma\n    -   Tree shaking for unused local CSS\n    -   Local names for keyframe animations, grid lines, `@container`, `@counter-style`, etc.\n\n    Issue [#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20) (the issue for this feature) is esbuild's most-upvoted issue! While this release still leaves that issue open, it's an important first step in that direction.\n\n-   Parse `:is`, `:has`, `:not`, and `:where` in CSS\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse the contents of these pseudo-class selectors as a selector list. This means you will now get syntax warnings within these selectors for invalid selector syntax. It also means that esbuild's CSS nesting transform behaves slightly differently than before because esbuild is now operating on an AST instead of a token stream. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      :where(.foo&) {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(.foo:is(div)) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(div.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack (webpack)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.88.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.88.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fixed a bug where unused identifiers should retain names when using css modules by [@&#8203;burhanuday](https://togithub.com/burhanuday) in [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Its support for passing multiple entry points is especially interesting.\r\n\r\nScenario: I'm building a regular old website (MPA), documentation for a component library. There are over 100 components, with each multiple examples that I'd like to run live on the site.\r\nThe documentation site is not an Angular SPA, but set up via a \"markdown -> static site\" generator ([mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nExpose the internal application builder function, allowing me to build the entire documentation with multiple entry-points—each with its own bootstrap—in one go.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default createBuilder((input, context) =>\r\n\tbuildApplicationInternal( // <-- using internal import here\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\twatch: false,\r\n\t\t\tprogress: false,\r\n\r\n\t\t\tindex: false,\r\n\t\t\tentryPoints: collectEntryPoints(context),\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// more options\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcontext,\r\n\t),\r\n);\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPast solutions for our documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Make the documentation a regular angular app. That's how we started out, turns out no one likes writing documentation like this.\r\n2. Copy the aio setup from angular/angular and make our own \"markdown pages -> angular app\" pipeline. Tried that, but the setup of aio is&hellip; not the easiest to understand or maintain if you're not used to it.\r\n3. Use storybook. That's where we're currently at.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to exposing the internal application builder function:\r\n\r\n4. Build every page into a separate angular app. This makes the build prohibitively slow.\r\n5. Build a single angular app with bootstraps for every documentation page. This would either load all code for all pages for any page, or it would require quite a lot of shenanigans to ensure we don't load all that superfluous javascript over a shabby internal corporate proxy server.\r\n6. Make the multiple entry points available in the existing experimental application builder's schema. For me this solution would work equally well, but I believe the use case (running angular in an MPA) to be so different from what a regular angular app looks like that adding the option will only lead to confusion for developers who just want to build SPAs.\r\n7. Make a separate \"MPA application\" builder. This puts the onus on the angular team to properly support building Angular MPAs, which I don't expect to align with the goals of the framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose internal application builder function\" (#25556)"},{"Id":"1810397018","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T20:10:11","Actor":"HerRA17","Number":"25554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Trying to use ng command and I get this two sort of errors: npm ERR!

For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV && doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild --define:DEV=true`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --define:DEV=false`\n\n    One drawback of this approach is that the resulting code crashes if you don't provide a value for `DEV` with `--define:`. In practice this isn't that big of a problem, and there are also various ways to work around this.\n\n    However, another approach that avoids this drawback is to use JavaScript label statements instead. That's what the `--drop-labels=` flag implements. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV: doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, you can now build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --drop-labels=DEV`\n\n    This means that code containing optional development-only checks can now be written such that it's safe to run without any additional configuration. The `--drop-labels=` flag takes comma-separated list of multiple label names to drop.\n\n-   Avoid causing `unhandledRejection` during shutdown ([#&#8203;3219](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3219))\n\n    All pending esbuild JavaScript API calls are supposed to fail if esbuild's underlying child process is unexpectedly terminated. This can happen if `SIGINT` is sent to the parent `node` process with Ctrl+C, for example. Previously doing this could also cause an unhandled promise rejection when esbuild attempted to communicate this failure to its own child process that no longer exists. This release now swallows this communication failure, which should prevent this internal unhandled promise rejection. This change means that you can now use esbuild's JavaScript API with a custom `SIGINT` handler that extends the lifetime of the `node` process without esbuild's internals causing an early exit due to an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n-   Update browser compatibility table scripts\n\n    The scripts that esbuild uses to compile its internal browser compatibility table have been overhauled. Briefly:\n\n    -   Converted from JavaScript to TypeScript\n    -   Fixed some bugs that resulted in small changes to the table\n    -   Added [`caniuse-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caniuse-lite) and [`@mdn/browser-compat-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;mdn/browser-compat-data) as new data sources (replacing manually-copied information)\n\n    This change means it's now much easier to keep esbuild's internal compatibility tables up to date. You can review the table changes here if you need to debug something about this change:\n\n    -   [JS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/d259b8fac717ee347c19bd8299f2c26d7c87481a...af1d35c372f78c14f364b63e819fd69548508f55#diff-1649eb68992c79753469f02c097de309adaf7231b45cc816c50bf751af400eb4)\n    -   [CSS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/commit/95feb2e09877597cb929469ce43811bdf11f50c1#diff-4e1c4f269e02c5ea31cbd5138d66751e32cf0e240524ee8a966ac756f0e3c3cd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.45.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.45.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.44.0...v8.45.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`cdd063c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/cdd063c388bbfe1781d7a864a832f03a2c1cc277) feat: Expose LegacyESLint in unsupported API ([#&#8203;17341](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17341)) (Nicholas C.

\"**_table-flex-styles.scss**\" file\r\n\r\n`mat-cell,\r\n    mat-header-cell,\r\n    mat-footer-cell {\r\n\r\n        // Note: we use `first-of-type`/`last-of-type` here in order to prevent extra\r\n

&:not(:only-of-type) {\r\n                padding-left: 0;\r\n                padding-right: $row-horizontal-padding;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &:last-of-type {\r\n

   }\r\n        }\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nfor LTR it works fine because we set only padding-left for the first-of-type and padding-right for the last-of-type, and still get the original one in (data-table-theme.scss) which will be in my case 16 and 24 cool.\r\n\r\nin RTL we set them equal to zero which breaks what we have in the data-table-theme.scss\r\n\r\n###

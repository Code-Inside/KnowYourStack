At least 90% of the time, this is so that I can describe CSS for mobile vs desktop differently. I can bind the element attribute to individual elements if necessary, but usually, multiple elements in a component need to react to changes in screen size, so I like to bind it at the `:host` level, and drill down to affected elements in CSS.\r\n\r\nIf I want to bind an element attribute to an Observable, I have to follow 3 steps:\r\n\r\n1. Do the async work somewhere.\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class SomeService {\r\n  asyncProduct$ = new BehaviorSubject('foo');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Build access to the Observable in component logic.\r\n```\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-thing'})\r\nexport class SomeComponent {\r\nproductAccess$ = this.svc.asyncProduct$.asObservable();\r\nconstructor(private svc: SomeService) {\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Bind the element attribute(s) to the access built in step 2.\r\n```\r\n<div [attr.product]=\"productAccess$ | async\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr an alternative, used more often:\r\n1. Do the async work somewhere. (Same as above.)\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class SomeService {\r\n  asyncProduct$ = new BehaviorSubject('foo');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Build access to the Observable in component logic, this time by managing a Subscription.\r\n```\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-thing'})\r\nexport class SomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  subscriptions = new Subscription();\r\n  productAccess: ProductAccess;\r\n  constructor(private svc: SomeService) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.aubscriptions.add(\r\n      this.svc.asyncProduct$.subscribe(prod => this.productAccess = prod)\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n    this.subscriptions.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Bind the attribute to the template using @HostBinding syntax. Same code as step 2, but just add:\r\n`@HostBinding('attr.product') productAccess: ProductAccess`\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt would be cleaner if `@HostBinding()` could manage subscription to an Observable. Then I wouldn't have to maintain logic in the template at all.\r\n```\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-thing'})\r\nexport class SomeComponent {\r\n  @HostBinding('attr.prod' ) productAccess$: ProductAccess = this.svc.productAccess$.asObservable();\r\n  constructor(private svc: SomeService) {}\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI know of no other alternatives.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46305","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bind to Observable/Promise directly in HostBinding\" (#46305)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1268091761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T23:18:12","Actor":"clydin","Number":"23350","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: enable TypeScript useUnknownInCatchVariables compiler option","State":"open","Body":"Enables the TypeScript `useUnknownInCatchVariables` option.

I've successfully gone from 7->10 so far (going major to major using the guide). The command I'm using is what is published, ```ng update @angular/core@11 @angular/cli@11```. I get a series of angular dependencies that cannot be resolved. I have tried with ```--force``` with no success, and when I try ```--legacy-peer-deps``` I get an error that it is not a dependency. I've deleted my package-lock.json and tried again also with no success. I've also tried ```npx @angular/cli@11 update @angular/core@11 @angular/cli@11 ``` both with and without ```--force```.\r\n\r\nI also downgraded node to 14.9 as I saw recommended on StackOverflow but no success.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThese are my dependencies and dev dependencies in my package.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^10.2.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/flex-layout\": \"^10.0.0-beta.32\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^10.2.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"git-describe\": \"^4.0.4\",\r\n    \"jwt-decode\": \"^2.2.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~6.6.7\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.10.2\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.1002.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~10.2.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.3.8\",\r\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^5.1.2\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~3.5.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~3.0.2\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^1.5.0\",\r\n    \"protractor\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~6.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.0.8\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nnpm ERR! code ERESOLVE\r\nnpm ERR!

We use typings from an npm package locally for the bare module specifier, but `importmap` at runtime to route it to the CDN.\r\n\r\nI know this builder is experimental still, but I figured you would be interested in understanding how we're attempting to use it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would expect to provide these options via `angular.json`. Something along the lines of an `esbuildOptions` property that will get passed directly down to esbuild.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've modified the `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/builders/browser-esbuild/esbuild.js` file locally for testing purposes to get by for now which works, but otherwise I'll need to fork this repo to produce my own build that supports this until it's implemented in the main package. If this isn't something on your radar any time soon please let me know and I could create a PR when it comes time for us needing to put more priority on this.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you know of an alternative workaround to pass the config for the short term please let me know!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"support for providing esbuild options\" (#23322)"},{"Id":"1265139536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-08T19:31:22","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"23321","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): correctly print package manager name when an install is needed","State":"closed","Body":"I was testing if we supported a warning here today and noticed that it was printing \"Try installing with '[object Object] install'\".

The container spans the full width of the view and the button it positioned to the top right of the container. I would like to position the overlay so that it is under the button but connected to the container. When I click the button, I expect the overlay to be positioned correctly within the view.\r\n\r\nFrom my initial investigation, the issue seems to be related to the `max-width` and `max-height` CSS attributes provided by the `.cdk-overlay-pane` https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2f9a59a24c0464cbed7f54cbeb5cba73e6007715/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L62-L63\r\n\r\nIn my stackblitz sample, I copied over these attributes into the [`styles.css` file](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/styles.css) (line 56-57). If those lines are commented out/removed, the overlay will work as intended. It appears that when attempting to calculate whether or not the overlay will be within the view, the min-width and min-height will affect the calculation. Also good to note that if the overlay is connected to the button instead of the container, the overlay will also work as inteded. However, for my specific use case, that is not possible due to other technical limitations.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/app/app.component.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is that, regardless of which element the overlay is connected it, it will be positioned correctly within the view.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to position the overlay, the overlay will be pushed outside of the view\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 12.2.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.11\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25059","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): Overlay out of viewport bounds\" (#25059)"},{"Id":"1267999450","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T21:07:55","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25057","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25057","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25057)"},{"Id":"1267965435","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T20:14:23","Actor":"atrawally","Number":"25056","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level","State":"closed","Body":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in the Topography Guide where a function was incorrectly named.

I assume that it's only done once to optimise performance which makes sense. \r\n\r\nHowever, building higher levels of UX responsiveness into DropLists and Drag items often means altering their size. The particular example that I am working with at the moment is that of enlarging a drop area when the drag begins.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to manually trigger the CdkDropList to re-compute the height of both itself and any components within it (or at the very least just itself) so that it can respond to changes in the UI. \r\n\r\ne.g. to have a method like: `cdkDropList.recomputeSizes()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for users to drag items into an empty list, I'd like to enlarge a target drop Area on drag start. And so on drag start, I apply a class to the DropList that changes its height. The problem is that while the DropList itself grows in height, the effective drop-zone does not. It seems that although the CdkDropList has increased in height, Angular is using its own internal calculation of the original height to determine the dropZone.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172834247-26f056dc-2846-4a5c-b34f-e766e04cadc3.mov\r\n\r\nIn the recording above you can see how the drop area is enlarged on drag start. The `cdkDropList` element is indicated using the green dotted line. \r\n\r\nHowever you can see that although the DropList is enlarged to make it easier to drop the CdkDrag item into it, the majority of the list area will not receive the CdkDrag item. In fact it seems that the DropList will only receive the CdkDrag item once it enters the drop area that the list originally covered before it was enlarged. \r\n\r\nThe same effect is not observed when the minimum height set statically to be the larger size:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172837498-1b57ce31-5378-44b3-8e56-c143be296f66.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to trigger the list to recompute its own area so that it can behave correctly relative to its new,  larger size. \r\n\r\n### Bonus extra\r\nCreating advanced drag and drop behaviour can require resizing items in the list as well as just the list itself. It would be really nice to be able to trigger the DropList to be able to recompute the size of all elements and not just the drop area. \r\n\r\nAn example of this is collapsing elements in the list when a drag begins. The example below illustrates using a single-tiered DropList to mimic the behaviour of a nested list. The mimicry is done by removing the child elements entirely from the list before the drag begins,\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172834522-f9834d85-245a-4da5-ad90-23d409334907.mov\r\n\r\nAlthough the example above illustrates what looks like a nested list, it is in fact just a single-level list that uses indentation to create the illusion of nesting. The \"child\" nodes are removed from the list on drag start and then re-inserted after drag finish. Happily, this seems to work robustly. \r\n\r\nHowever it would be extremely useful to be able to change the items in the list during the drag process itself. Imagine for instance dragging an item over a folder that you wish to open. I can imagine that inserting items into a list during drag might be very complicated to code. However, a simple workaround could be achieved by having the items in the list from the start but with zero height and then enlarging their height when the parent folder opens. \r\n\r\nHowever this would again require the list to recompute the sizing of all elements so that we don't end up with an effect similar to that below. In this example, the child nodes aren't consistently removed from the tree before CdkDrag computes the item heights. And so the DropList calculates the sizing of all elements within it and only then are some of them removed - which results in the peculiar effect we see. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172831293-fb17441d-926b-41e3-9a37-2982bffaa444.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my understanding of the system is correct then all of this could potentially be worked around *if* it were possible to manully trigger recomputation of the size and position of `CdkDropList` and `CdkDrag` elements\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25045","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(DragDropModule): Allow manual triggering of CdkDropList and CdkDragElement size recomputation\" (#25045)"},{"Id":"1265844790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-09T11:07:31","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25044","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk/drag-drop): move sorting and positioning logic into a separate class","State":"closed","Body":"This is an internal reorganization of the drop list to make it easier to eventually add support for mixed orientation.

This is possible thanks to the `share` rxjs operator.\r\nBy doing that I optimize the amount of request to Firestore and keep the last value in cache.\r\n\r\nI tried to switch to the signal API to reduce my dependency to zone.js (which has some issues with Firebase) but there is no way to track how many elements are listening on the changes of the signal. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate an API that return the amount of active listeners on a signal. Maybe something like that : \r\n```typescript\r\nconst counter = signal(0);\r\nconst listeners = signalListeners(counter); // returns a Signal<number> with value 0 by default\r\nconst ref1 = effect(() => console.log(counter())); // `listeners`'s value is now 1\r\nconst isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2);\r\nconst ref2 = effect(() => console.log(isEven())); // `listeners`'s value is now 2\r\nref1.destroy();  // `listeners`'s value is now 1\r\n```\r\nHere is how I would use it : \r\n```typescript\r\nsignals: Record<string, WritableSignal> = {};\r\nlisteners: Record<string, Signal<number>> = {};\r\neffects: Record<string, EffectRef> = {};\r\n\r\ndoc(ref: DocumentRef) {\r\n  const isRegistered = ref.path in this.effects;\r\n  this.signals[ref.path] ||= signal(undefined);\r\n  this.listeners[ref.path] ||= signalListeners(this.signales[ref.path]);\r\n  if (!this.effects[ref.path]) {\r\n    let previous = 0;\r\n    let unsubscribe: () => void;\r\n    this.effects[ref.path]effect((cleanup) => {\r\n      const listeners = this.listeners[ref.path]();\r\n      // Start listening on first listener \r\n      if (!previous && listeners) {\r\n        unsubscribe = onSnapshot(ref, (snap) => this.signals[ref.path].set(snap)).unsubscribe;\r\n      }\r\n      // Stop listening when there is no listeners\r\n      if (previous && !listeners) {\r\n        unsubscribe();\r\n      }\r\n      previous = listeners;\r\n      cleanup(() => unsubscribe());\r\n    }, {\r\n      manualCleanup: true\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n return this.signals[ref.path];\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Cleanup everything if service is destroy\r\nngOnDestroy() {\r\n  for (const key in this.effects) {\r\n    this.effects[key].destroy();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently at best I can know how many components have requested a document by adding an `effect` on very request, but there is no way to know if any of these component is actually listening on the signal changes. Also if the signal is used inside an `*ngIf=\"false\"` then we shouldn't listen on Firestore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50182","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signal - provide a way to know if there is listeners\" (#50182)"},{"Id":"1698543202","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T18:39:05","Actor":"sergey-morenets","Number":"50177","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bind routing inputs feature is not working as expected","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nHi\r\n\r\nAccording to this features request (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49633) I can bind my inputs to revolver's arguments in Angular 16.\r\nI took the working prototype from the official Angular 16 announcement (https://blog.angular.io/angular-v16-is-here-4d7a28ec680d):\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'about',\r\n    loadComponent: import('./about'),\r\n    resolve: { contact: () => getContact() }\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@Component(...)\r\nexport class About {\r\n  // The value of \"contact\" is passed to the contact input\r\n  @Input() contact?: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo here's my example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [{\r\n  component: BookComponent,\r\n  path: 'book',\r\n  resolve: {book: () => new Book()}\r\n},\r\n  {component: HomeComponent, path: ''}];\r\n\r\nexport class BookComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  book?: Book;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    console.log('book=' + this.book);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWhen I navigate to BookComponent (using \"/book\" relative URL) I expect that book input property will be initialized in ngOnInit.

Because I didn't understand the text below the form as \"how to update\", I kept pressing this assuming it would possibly open a new tab/modal, or somehow show the information I expected, and my impression was that it was broken. \r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50185","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular update guide does not have instructions for how to actually update via CLI\" (#50185)"},{"Id":"1699074515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T13:51:59","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50191","RawContent":null,"Title":"`Signal.mutate()` : Mutated objects are not reflected in the DOM","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWith the latest build 16.0.0 : \r\n\r\nOn a `Signal<Array<any>>`, calling `mutate(arr => arr.push('something') )`  does not update the node in the template. \r\n\r\nWe can also note that a child component isn't updated when a signal object as input has been mutated. \r\n\r\n[Repro on stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-pxwvcd?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this expected or should it be mentioned that mutability breaks the rendering ?

In my opinion this would be a perfect match.\r\nAnd as you can see in #5689 there is a need for reactive `@Input`\r\n@mgechev closed this issue because it would mean more coupling to RxJS. (Which is totally understandable)\r\n\r\nNowadays both features (`@Input` and `Signal`) reside in @angular/core. So lets get that going\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImagine how cool this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, computed, SignalInput, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-demo-input-signal',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      Sum is {{sum()}}\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoInputSignalComponent {\r\n\r\n  @SignalInput()\r\n  num1 = signal<number>(0);\r\n  \r\n  @SignalInput()\r\n  num2 = signal<number>(0);\r\n\r\n\r\n  sum = computed(() => this.num1() + this.num2());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is a trivial example, but often times I need to do a calculation or backend-lookup using two `@Input` values. Yes it is possible to pass complex values to `@Input` but thats kinda ugly.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing Signals for `@Inputs` is currently very verbose:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, computed, Input, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-demo-input-signal',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      Sum is {{sum()}}\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoInputSignalComponent {\r\n\r\n  num1Signal = signal<number>(0);\r\n  num2Signal = signal<number>(0);\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set num1(value: number) {\r\n    this.num1Signal.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get num1(): number {\r\n    return this.num1Signal();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set num2(value: number) {\r\n    this.num2Signal.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get num2(): number {\r\n    return this.num2Signal();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sum = computed(() => this.num1Signal() + this.num2Signal());\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: Reactive @Inputs with signals\" (#50190)"},{"Id":"1699029522","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T11:53:06","Actor":"bagbag","Number":"50189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signals - interoperability with non-angular libraries","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI develop a library which is shared between server and client and does not depend on angular. I would like to use angulars signals in there.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to separate signals from the rest of angular (like preact does it), but I don't think that this will happen for various reasons, which was also stated in the RFC if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nSo my idea was to just copy the signals implementation, remove zone.js stuff in `effect()`, use `queueMicrotask()` instead of `ApplicationRef.tick()` as the scheduling. use that implementation for the server and the implementation in angular for the client. I actually did that to be able to use signals in angular v15 and it worked flawless (but of course without native support in templates).\r\n\r\nIn order for the signals created in the library code to work in angular and vice versa they must be created by angular.  My basic idea for that (not the actual code):\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as Angular from '@angular/core';\r\nimport * as ExtractedSignals from './extracted-signals';\r\n\r\nexport let signal: signalFn = throwNotConfigured as any;\r\nexport let computed: computedFn = throwNotConfigured as any;\r\n\r\nif (isAngular()) {\r\n  signal = Angular.signal; // @angular/core signal\r\n  computed = Angular.computed; // @angular/core computed\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  signal = ExtractedSignals.signal; // extracted signal\r\n  computed = ExtractedSignals.computed; // extracted computed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is to now import signal/computed etc. from that file and use that throughout the shared library and server code. When running in an angular app, it is technically the same (runtime behaviour) as if it was imported from `@angular/core`, but the types differ. When running outside an angular app it still works the same (except for effect scheduling) without depending on angular.\r\n\r\nThis seems to work well except for one part: types. The `SIGNAL` symbols from the two `Signal` types are obviously incompatible, as they are `unique symbol`s. So I can't pass signals from angular to the library and vice versa, even though they are identical at runtime.\r\n\r\nIs there someone with an idea on how to solve this without changes to angular?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to mark `[SIGNAL]` as optional. But this will probably have unwanted side-effects like allowing to pass plain functions to `Signal` parameters.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type Signal<T> = (() => T) & {\r\n    [SIGNAL]?: unknown;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to use an `interface` instead of a type to be able to use typescripts declaration merging.\r\nBoth `@angular/core` and the shared library export it this way (`SIGNAL` is not exported in the current version):\r\n```ts\r\nexport const SIGNAL: unique symbol;\r\n\r\nexport interface Signal<T> {\r\n  (): T;\r\n  [SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumer of angular and the shared library then merges them:\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module 'shared-library' {\r\n  interface Signal<T> {\r\n    [AngularCore.SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare module '@angular/core' {\r\n  interface Signal<T> {\r\n    [SharedLibrary.SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA thought that just appeared while I wrote that:\r\nIt actually would be enough if angular exports the `SIGNAL` symbol. Then I could merge one way, so that the libary `Signal` also have that symbol. But this way the library code would lack that extra bit of type safety if used standalone.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nSome `any`s in the glue-code and implicit type coercion, either using functions or types when passing library signals to angular and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBut this is out of question for me, as it's a bad DX and may reduces type safety.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50189","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals - interoperability with non-angular libraries\" (#50189)"},{"Id":"1698834101","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T11:43:58","Actor":"pablomaurer","Number":"50184","RawContent":null,"Title":"an alternative way for the proxy.conf.json in the new esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI wanted to try out the new esbuild builder.

One comment [#16779 comment ](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16779#issuecomment-579183693) stated it was not meant for files outside of bundles.  If I'm not mistaken, styles are part of the bundle.\r\n\r\nThe problem: I'm using a styles package that I don't have control over.  It has a less variable for setting the base-href path for the assets.  \r\n- When I serve it up at `/`, everything is fine\r\n- When I serve it up at  `/some-path` I have to update this less variable to /some-path/assets\r\n\r\nNow I have different configurations when I'm running the app locally and when I'm deploying it at /some-path on a server and angular fileReplacements doesn't support this scenario.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to be able to replace any file at the src root level for different configurations.  This would allow me to have:\r\n\r\n- styles.base.less (all my imports and global styles)\r\n- styles.less (import styles.base.less and modify the less variable)\r\n- styles.local.less (import styles.base.less, no variable modification, use this to replace styles.less in local config)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n- Considered fileReplacement above ^\r\n- Considered putting a file in assets, but I believe .less is a preprocessor on css and it would only copy the file\r\n- Considered webpack.config.js but again it would just copy the file without doing the pre-processing\r\n- Considered running a script right before build.  I'm using nx so none of my nx build commands would work without creating an npm script for each one","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25152","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"fileReplacement for less files\" (#25152)"},{"Id":"1697863963","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-05T16:12:11","Actor":"whyboris","Number":"25150","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 16 - esbuild - 404 on routes inside proxy.conf.json","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon, core, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen `angular.json` has `esbuild` enabled (in `architect.build.builder`):\r\n```\r\n\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\r\n```\r\nThe app, running locally, shows `404` in the _Network_ tab of Chrome Developer Tools on API call that is set up in the `proxy.conf.json`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"/authapi/*\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"https://stage-api.forbes.com\",\r\n    \"changeOrigin\": true,\r\n    \"secure\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLocally the app runs on `https://one.forbes.com:4200/`  and my `hosts` file has this entry `127.0.0.1 one.forbes.com`\r\n\r\nWhen running the same code but changing the `builder`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works as it did before ✅ (no 404, API call is made)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nn/a\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n`404 Not Found` in Chrome's _Network_ tab when clicking on the API call that was supposed to work.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.6\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@angular/material               14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI'm sorry I'm unsure if there is anything else that could be affecting the outcome I'm seeing.

This allows\r\nreuse of processed packages across `ng serve` invocations.

The first time\r\na package is used within an application there may be a short delay upon accessing the page as the\r\npackage is processed. Due to the persistent nature of the prebundling, the `ng cache` command is used\r\nto control the use of the feature.

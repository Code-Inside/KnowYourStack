Only when the custom rAF- scheduled `detectChanges()` call triggered would `ngOnChanges` be called.\r\n\r\n * CD always ran multiple times, because of the above. `NgZone.run` would trigger CD, and then separately the scheduler would trigger CD.\r\n\r\n * Signal inputs were not supported, since inputs were set via direct property writes.\r\n\r\nThis change refactors the custom element implementation with two changes:\r\n\r\n1. `ComponentRef.setInput` is used instead of a custom code path for writing inputs.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to drop all the custom logic related to managing `ngOnChanges`, since `setInput` does that under the hood. `ngOnChanges` behavior now matches how the component would behave when _not_ rendered as a custom element.\r\n\r\n2. The custom rAF-based CD scheduler is removed.\r\n\r\nRunning `NgZone.run` is sufficient to trigger CD when zones are used, and the hybrid zoneless scheduler now ensures CD is scheduled when `setInput` is called even with no ZoneJS enabled.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this change, the elements tests have been significantly refactored. Previously all of Angular was faked/spied, which had a number of downsides. For example, there were tests which asserted that change detection only happens once when setting multiple inputs. This wasn't actually the case (because of `NgZone.run` - see logic above) but the test didn't catch the issue because it was only spying on `detectChanges()` which isn't called from `ApplicationRef.tick()`. Even the components were fake.\r\n\r\nNow, the tests use real Angular components and factories. They've also been updated to not use `fakeAsync`.\r\n\r\nA number of tests have been disabled, which were previously asserting behavior that wasn't matching what was actually happening (as above). Other tests were disabled due to real differences with `ngOnChanges` behavior, where the current behavior could be seen as a bug.\r\n\r\nFixes #53981","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56728","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(elements): switch to `ComponentRef.setInput` & remove custom scheduler\" (#56728)"},{"Id":"2375009398","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T23:58:30","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56692","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add mention of `picture` support in FAQ","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56692","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: Add mention of `picture` support in FAQ\" (#56692)"},{"Id":"2376416769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T23:09:16","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image instruction","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits. \r\n\r\n----\r\nContext: The Aurora team would like to add support in the `NgOptimizedImage` directive for automatic detection of file sizes when the file is a locale file. \r\n\r\nThis feature would be implemented in 2 steps: \r\n1.

Of course the real functionality is completely correctly documented. I'm at fault for not checking the documentation earlier. However in my defence, the realisation that this method does something completely different than its name suggests, meant that I didn't realise that it was this function that caused the problem for several hours. Once I realised that, I checked the documentation, and immediately understood the issue.\r\n\r\n`Router.navigateByUrl` does not _navigate_ to a _URL_[^1]. It instead _routes_ to the given _Angular route string_.\r\n\r\nI was trying to restore an older page the user visited before navigating away, and was trying to do so by doing this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Before navigate away:\r\nsessionStorage.setItem('returnUri', window.location.href);\r\n\r\n// After return\r\nthis.router.navigateByUrl(sessionStorage.getItem('returnUri') ?? window.location.origin);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is that you always get routed to the fallback route, since `navigateByUrl` _cannot navigate to URLs_.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Since the term URL is sometimes unclear, in the context of the Angular Router I'd understand a URL as something that conforms to the URI grammar below where the scheme value is `https`. Given the context I've excluded otherwise valid URI schemes that would also create valid URLs, such as mailto, wss, tel etc.\r\n    `URI = scheme \":\" [\"//\" authority] path [\"?\" query] [\"#\" fragment]`\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n- Mark `navigateByUrl` as deprecated.\r\n- Create a function `routeToAbsolutePath` or just `routeToPath` (name pending).\r\n- Both the old and new function definitions should run the same logic.\r\n- Really remove `navigateByUrl` after some major versions.\r\n\r\nI expect the deprecation marker will probably help people a lot already. My IDE automatically complains when I use a deprecated method. Then I'll read the documentation immediately, to find out why it's deprecated, and which function I should use instead.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDon't do anything. It's not actually broken. Just confusingly named, but it's been that way for a long time.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56672","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Rename `Router.navigateByUrl`\" (#56672)"},{"Id":"2373663596","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-25T21:07:54","Actor":"eblocha","Number":"56595","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular devtools fails to display component information when it injects a number value","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a bug report or a feature request?\n\n- [X] Bug Report\n- [ ] Feature Request\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue [Bug Report only]\n\nCreate a component that injects a number via an injection token:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst MY_NUMBER = new InjectionToken<number>('my-number');\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-component',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  providers: [{ provide: MY_NUMBER, useValue: 42 }]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  readonly myNumber = inject(MY_NUMBER);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the chrome debugger shows it coming from `valueToLabel` inside `component-tree.ts`.

Once after deployment of  the upgraded application we encountered permanent memory  increase and finally the application restarting due to OOM. \r\n\r\nAfter investigating it became obvious that the heap space size only got exceeded when using native node fetch. Removing `withFetch()` fixed the problem. Below find a screeshot from Datadog monitoring, which nicely shows what happened over the past weeks.\r\n\r\n![app_heap_space_usage_graph_4_weeks](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/48031693/7e0713f8-b5d8-4047-ab50-2d24263606ad)\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude a dependency to the node version , we tried with several versions from v20 up to recent v22. The behaviour when using native fetch was reproducible.\r\n\r\nAssuming that native node fetch will very likely become standard in future NG versions and the polyfill will become removed, this makes me a bit nervous when seeing our massive problems while using native fetch!\r\n\r\nI won't provide a repo at this point, as it requires time preparing it and I am not sure if it will add value, because\r\n* the issue is so obvious it actually must be known already (even though I'm wondering I didn't find anything related)\r\n* I'm not fully sure if it is even related to Angular but rather a bug in node / undici implementation (found a lot of not cleaned up undici Timeout references between heap size snapshots)\r\n* when providing a repro, the memory footprint for such example app is much smaller than with our enterprise app, so it will only be possible to recognize a memory increase by taking multiple memory snapshots while app is requesting data and comparing new instances created but not cleaned up between 2 snapshots.\r\n\r\nThat's why I first wanna post this issue in hope someone already knows the issue and might have an idea or direction what's causing it or even how to fix it. If still a repro would be required, let me know and I will try to provide one.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTobias\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nSee above\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.5\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.5\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, google-maps, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router, ssr\r\n... youtube-player\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.5\r\nng-packagr                      17.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56586","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Memory leakage in SSR while using native node fetch\" (#56586)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2376394157","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T22:46:36","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27944","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): improve BuildOutputFile property access","State":"open","Body":"The `BuildOutputFile` type's helper functions have been adjusted to cache commonly accessed property values to avoid potentially expensive repeat processing.

With Angular 18 and new `@angular/build:application` builder it's no longer possible to script this task.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be niche feature request. But tracking budgets helps to see, how the size changes overtime.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhen I run `build`, I'd like to have cli option that would update `angular.json` file and the budgets section. It's tedious to update that file manually.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have a script for this task but it does not work with the new builder. The produced `stats.json` does not have enough information. There is no information which chunks are initial and which are loaded later. Also, I'm not sure how I could map the chunks to budgets in angular.json. Before the stats.json had the same chunkName and it could be just compared with the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nThis method was also nice, because I could print table that compared the values from angular.json and stats.json and see difference. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to expose the data that builder clearly has when it prints the output table? With that data, I could update my script to work.\r\n\r\nAt least there seems to be a way to convert entryPoint to chunkName: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/5b81e0f310609ceefaa09342722163233c14b47c/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/budget-stats.ts#L46-L48","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Option to update budgets when building app or export list of initial chunk files\" (#27941)"},{"Id":"2376003747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T18:26:57","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"27939","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.6 release\" (#27939)"},{"Id":"2375949567","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T18:21:59","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"27938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.6\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.6\" with changelog.\" (#27938)"},{"Id":"2375690930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T16:27:06","Actor":"fhaag","Number":"27935","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-server executor expects certain options, but error message does not give away how to solve","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nrun\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUsing another target for `dev-server` than `build` results in an unclear error message.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn my `project.json` file, I have a `testserve` target that uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server` executor:\r\n```json\r\n\"testserve\": {\r\n\t\"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": {\r\n\t\t\"development\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"buildTarget\": \"myProject:build:development\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n`build` is another target in the same `project.json` file. When invoking `nx run testserve`, this works flawlessly.\r\n\r\nNow, I have declared a new target for testing purposes:\r\n```json\r\n\"testoutput\": {\r\n\t\"command\": \"echo 'TEST'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOn its own, that target works - `nx run testoutput` results in the text `TEST` to be printed to the console.\r\n\r\nThen, I have tried to use that target for `dev-server` instead of `build`:\r\n```json\r\n\"testserve\": {\r\n\t\"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": {\r\n\t\t\"development\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"buildTarget\": \"myProject:testoutput\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\nThe expected outcome of invoking `nx run testserve` is that it will output the text `TEST`, and maybe repeat to do so whenever the live reload of `dev-server` strikes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the actual outcome is this error:\r\n> TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"paths[1]\" argument must be of type string. Received undefined\r\n\r\nI suspect only a subset of targets with certain options are eligible to be used here, but unfortunately, the error message does not give away what exactly is required (nor does the project's readme file).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems when you use `nx init` to initialize NX using the current version, the attribute is called `browserTarget` instead of `buildTarget`. However, the result is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be observed in this repro with the minimal sample modified as described above: https://github.com/fhaag/angular-cli-bug-repro/tree/buildtarget-issue\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"paths[1]\" argument must be of type string.

v18.\r\n\r\nI'd sugest removing the elevation, and let the user chooses when to apply it... but this, will probably break many apps/tests.\r\nPerhaps an input option to remove it?\r\n\r\nYou can check an example in the MD3 site.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/12090931/b3e13c43-3c10-48e8-ab46-90be4f23fa99)\r\n\r\n###

back the old bahavior to color the buttons.\r\n\r\nSo my styles are bloated with\r\n```SCSS\r\n    .mdc-button {\r\n        &.mat-secondary {\r\n            @include mat.button-color($theme, $color-variant: secondary);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &.mat-tertiary {\r\n            @include mat.button-color($theme, $color-variant: tertiary);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &.mat-error {\r\n            @include mat.button-color($theme, $color-variant: error);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .mdc-fab {\r\n        &.mat-secondary {\r\n            @include mat.fab-color($theme, $color-variant: secondary);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &.mat-tertiary {\r\n            @include mat.fab-color($theme, $color-variant: tertiary);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .mat-mdc-icon-button {\r\n        &.mat-secondary {\r\n            @include mat.icon-button-color($theme);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &.mat-tertiary {\r\n            @include mat.icon-button-color($theme);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &.mat-error {\r\n            @include mat.icon-button-color($theme);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut as you can see, I cannot use the color variant in the icon-button, so it only generated the same style 3 times\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ncreate all 3 color variants of the icon button\n\n### Actual

A TS file with a component and templateUrl exists\r\n2. The template file does not exist.\r\n3. First build: ngtsc will properly report the error, via a FatalDiagnosticError\r\n4. The template file is now created\r\n5. Second build: ngtsc still reports the same errror.\r\n\r\nNgtsc persists the analysis data of the component and never invalidates it when the template/style\r\nfile becomes available later.\r\n\r\nThis breaks incremental builds and potentially common workflows where resource files are added\r\nlater after the TS file is created. This did not surface as an issue in the Angular CLI yet because Webpack \r\nrequires users to re-start the process when a new file is added. With ESBuild this will change and this\r\nalso breaks incremental builds with Bazel/Blaze workers.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have a few options:\r\n\r\n* Invalidate the analysis when e.g. the template file is missing. Never caching it means that it will be\r\nre-analyzed on every build iteration.\r\n* Add the resource dependency to ngtsc's incremental file graph. ngtsc will then know via `host.getModifiedResources` when the file becomes available- and fresh analysis of component would occur.\r\n\r\nThe first approach is straightforward to implement and was chosen here. The second approach would\r\nallow ngtsc to re-use more of the analysis when we know that e.g. the template file still not there, but it \r\nncreases complexity unnecessarily because there is no **single** obvious resource path for e.g. a `templateUrl`.\r\nThe URL is attempted to be resolved using multiple strategies, such as TS program root dirs, or there is support\r\nfor a custom resolution through `host.resourceNameToFileName`.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to determine some candidate paths and add them to the dependency tracker, but it\r\nseems incomplete given possible external resolvers like `resourceNameToFileName` and also would likely \r\nnot have a sufficient-enough impact given that a broken component decorator is not expected to remain\r\nfor too long between N incremental build iterations.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49184","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): do not persist component analysis if template/styles are missing\" (#49184)"},{"Id":"1597199923","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-23T16:50:50","Actor":"wartab","Number":"49181","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): make Location.normalize() return the correct path when the base path contains characters that interfere with regex syntax.","State":"open","Body":"Fix the function stripping the base path from the URL, as the current implementation uses the base path as part of a regex, which wrongly makes paths fails that contain characters such as a parenthesis (example: C:/Users/MyUser(Test)/project).\r\n\r\nFixes #49179\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

performance monitoring we built a library combining [zone.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js) and the [Javascript native Error

\r\n\r\nWe currently struggle using it inside Angular applications because it seems that the angular core do something that make us lose track of our call stack if we use our wrapper around functions that contains rxjs Observables.\r\n\r\n## Step for bug reproduction\r\n- Clone this [repository](https://github.com/sdedieu/angular-zone-custom-fork-parent-lost-in-rxjs-operators)\r\n- Run the `npm

display in the console: `promise_bar promise_foo`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nAs the one using `Promise`, the wrapped method using `rxjs Observable` should display in the console: `obs_bar

Under the hood, this mostly rerenders the Angular application from scratch, which is better than a full page reload, but could definitely be improved. @alan-agius4 has suggested a number of opportunities for improving HMR. Most importantly, our strategy here should be to optimize the turnaround time for any given change _scaled_ with the frequency of that kind of change. For example, it is very common to make numerous tiny adjustments to CSS in quick succession while finding the precise styling needed for a page. This is a very hot path to optimize and even marginal improvements here can have a bit impact due to how frequently CSS-only changes are made during development.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSome ideas to improve HMR include (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n* Fast track CSS-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * This should be relatively straightforward since we mostly need to correlate a component class with its `<style />` tag on the page, then delete and recreate that tag with the new CSS content. This would be very fast and maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline styles is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Fast track Angular template-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * In theory, we just need to delete the generated JavaScript render functions for a component and overwrite them with the new render functions from the modified template, then re-apply the DOM.\r\n    * In practice, I think this is a challenge as Angular templates aren't completely stateless (ex. `async` pipe). But this is likely achievable in some capacity. Should be pretty quick and mostly maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline templates is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Re-render only the currently displayed Angular route, rather than the full application.\r\n    * Statistically speaking, most code changes will be within the currently displayed Angular route and won't impact anything outside the route. In many cases, it would be sufficient to just rerender that one route.\r\n\r\nAngular template and CSS changes in particular are two areas where users frequently make a large number of small changes in quick succession and in a manner which is easy for tooling to reason about. These are two spaces where we can have a huge impact on developer's quality of life.\r\n\r\nIf we can get this good enough, I'd love to get to a place where we could turn `--hmr` on by default in `ng serve`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHMR is mostly one facet of the larger problem around \"How do we make the time between editing a file and reloading its changes in the browser as quick as possible?\" (edit/refresh time). HMR is one means of getting built changes into the running browser faster and maintain the application's current state. We should (and are) investigating ways to improve the overall edit/refresh experience independent of HMR.\r\n\r\nMore related to HMR, the focus on Angular template and CSS changes does highlight a lack of focus on TypeScript changes. This is somewhat intentional. Angular has strong separation of concerns between Angular templates (for HTML/DOM rendering), CSS (for styling), and TypeScript (for component functionality). While this isn't absolute and TypeScript can often containing rendering or styling functionality (ex. list filters or conditional CSS classes), the vast majority of DOM and CSS changes made by a developer will be done by editing a template or a stylesheet, not TypeScript.\r\n\r\nTypeScript changes are also very tricky to apply consistently with HMR. As one example, renaming a class field in TypeScript _can_ be HMR'd, however doing so often leads to inconsistencies and confusing behavior. HMR is intended to maintain the current user state, but it is effectively impossible for the build process to understand that deleting a `foo` field and creating a `bar` field as intended as a rename and state should be transferred from one property to the other during HMR. At runtime, it looks like this renamed field just \"forgot\" all its state, which can easily break the component and cause errors which require a full page reload to fix. That's one example, but the sheer variety of possible changes a user can make to TypeScript code means it can never be totally consistent or reliable.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely be open to improvements here where we can take advantage of them, and we should make sure not to let \"perfect\" be the enemy of \"good enough\". The key takeaway here is that HMR of TypeScript-only changes in Angular is simultaneously the hardest to do right, and also the least impactful. Again, _scaling_ the impact of optimizing a particular change with the _frequency_ that kind of change occurs is where we can find the most value for users.\r\n\r\n/cc @alan-agius4 for other ideas around improving HMR, definitely lots of cool stuff we're hoping to do here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Hot Module Replacement (HMR)\" (#24755)"},{"Id":"1593448992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-21T16:56:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24753","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/core): remove deprecated exceptions","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nWith commits removes the several deprecated exceptions.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\n- `ContentHasMutatedException`, `InvalidUpdateRecordException`, `UnimplementedException` and `MergeConflictException` API from `@angular-devkit/core` have been removed in favor of the API from `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\r\n- `UnsupportedPlatformException` - A custom error exception should be created instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24753","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/core): remove deprecated exceptions\" (#24753)"},{"Id":"1593466417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-21T13:14:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24754","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove deprecated `outputPaths` and `outputPath` Builder output","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nRemove the deprecated `outputPath` and `outputPaths` from the server and browser builder.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nDeprecated `outputPath` and `outputPaths` from the server and browser builder have been removed from the builder output.

The `@nest` prefix that was previously required in some cases is now gone, and nested rules no longer have to start with `&` (as long as they don't start with an identifier or function token).\n\n    This release updates esbuild's pass-through handling of CSS nesting syntax to match the latest specification changes. So you can now use esbuild to bundle CSS containing nested rules and try them out in a browser that supports CSS nesting (which includes nightly builds of both Chrome and Safari).\n\n    However, I'm not implementing lowering of nested CSS to non-nested CSS for older browsers yet. While the syntax has been decided, the semantics are still in flux. In particular, there is still some debate about changing the fundamental way that CSS nesting works. For example, you might think that the following CSS is equivalent to a `.outer .inner button { ... }` rule:\n\n    ```css\n    .inner button {\n      .outer & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    But instead it's actually equivalent to a `.outer :is(.inner button) { ... }` rule which unintuitively also matches the following DOM structure:\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n      <div class=\"outer\">\n        <button></button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    The `:is()` behavior is preferred by browser implementers because it's more memory-efficient, but the straightforward translation into a `.outer .inner button { ... }` rule is preferred by developers used to the existing CSS preprocessing ecosystem (e.g. SASS). It seems premature to commit esbuild to specific semantics for this syntax at this time given the ongoing debate.\n\n-   Fix cross-file CSS rule deduplication involving `url()` tokens ([#&#8203;2936](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2936))\n\n    Previously cross-file CSS rule deduplication didn't handle `url()` tokens correctly. These tokens contain references to import paths which may be internal (i.e. in the bundle) or external (i.e. not in the bundle). When comparing two `url()` tokens for equality, the underlying import paths should be compared instead of their references. This release of esbuild fixes `url()` token comparisons. One side effect is that `@font-face` rules should now be deduplicated correctly across files:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;import \"data:text/css, \\\n      @&#8203;import 'http://example.com/style.css'; \\\n      @&#8203;font-face { src: url(http://example.com/font.ttf) }\";\n    @&#8203;import \"data:text/css, \\\n      @&#8203;font-face { src: url(http://example.com/font.ttf) }\";\n\n    /* Old output (with --bundle --minify) */\n    @&#8203;import\"http://example.com/style.css\";@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}\n\n    /* New output (with --bundle --minify) */\n    @&#8203;import\"http://example.com/style.css\";@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.17.9`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0179)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.8...v0.17.9)\n\n-   Parse rest bindings in TypeScript types ([#&#8203;2937](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2937))\n\n    Previously esbuild was unable to parse the following valid TypeScript code:\n\n    ```ts\n    let tuple: (...[e1, e2, ...es]: any) => any\n    ```\n\n    This release includes support for parsing code like this.\n\n-   Fix TypeScript code translation for certain computed `declare` class fields ([#&#8203;2914](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2914))\n\n    In TypeScript, the key of a computed `declare` class field should only be preserved if there are no decorators for that field. Previously esbuild always preserved the key, but esbuild will now remove the key to match the output of the TypeScript compiler:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    declare function dec(a: any, b: any): any\n    declare const removeMe: unique symbol\n    declare const keepMe: unique symbol\n    class X {\n        declare [removeMe]: any\n        @&#8203;dec declare [keepMe]: any\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    var _a;\n    class X {\n    }\n    removeMe, _a = keepMe;\n    __decorateClass([\n      dec\n    ], X.prototype, _a, 2);\n\n    // New output\n    var _a;\n    class X {\n    }\n    _a = keepMe;\n    __decorateClass([\n      dec\n    ], X.prototype, _a, 2);\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a crash with path resolution error generation ([#&#8203;2913](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2913))\n\n    In certain situations, a module containing an invalid import path could previously cause esbuild to crash when it attempts to generate a more helpful error message.

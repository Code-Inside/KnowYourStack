This flag is being enabled in g3, and so these changes are\r\nnecessary in the upstream repo.\r\n\r\nThe primary strategy taken in this commit is to cast the error to an\r\nappropriate type when necessary. This was applied mechanically, which for\r\nseveral files results in multiple casts for a single `catch` block. There is\r\nno cost here other than the repetition, and this can be cleaned up easily if\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the error was expected to conform to some interface beyond\r\n`Error`. In these cases, the type of the error variable was declared as\r\n`any` explicitly.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44688","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: enable `useUnknownInCatchVariables` across packages\" (#44688)"},{"Id":"1099702712","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-11T23:11:29","Actor":"bluebaroncanada","Number":"44687","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hot reload refreshes multiple times when passing websockets through IIS reverse proxy","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-server\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI need to replace a url sub-directory in my application with a new Angular app.  I want requests from /foo to be forwarded to localhost:4200.  I tried half a dozen ways to do this, and now I nearly have it working with IIS reverse proxy.  The application loads.  It thinks it's on the same domain as the rest of the application, websockets finally connect, but for some reason it refreshes many times after a saving an edit.  I can get away mostly, right now, without it, because I only need proof of concept that this scheme works to replace the sub-directory while keeping the tokens needed to make backend requests.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't priority or probably really a bug from Angular's point of view, but maybe someone has that crucial piece of knowledge that will help.\r\n\r\nHere are my IIS rules.  One thing I did find weird is how I have to Rewrite to http.  Dev Tools says it's connecting to ws, but if I set the rewrite to ws://localhost:4200/ws, I get 404'd.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.webServer>\r\n        <rewrite>\r\n            <rules>\r\n                <clear />\r\n                <rule name=\"AngularWebsockets\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"^ws$\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:4200/ws\" appendQueryString=\"false\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n                <rule name=\"Angular\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"^Angular(.*)\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                        <add input=\"{CACHE_URL}\" pattern=\"http://\" />\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:4200{R:1}\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n                <rule name=\"EazeeApp\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"(.*)\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                        <add input=\"{CACHE_URL}\" pattern=\"^(http?)://\" />\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:2319/{R:1}\" logRewrittenUrl=\"true\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n            </rules>\r\n        </rewrite>\r\n    </system.webServer>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this bug, you'll need to install ARR and Websocket support for IIS.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo error.

So far, it works really really great except for these 2 exceptions that I'm going to ask help.\r\n\r\nIn our project, we also implemented Rollbar to have a more detailed error tracking and in the last 2/3 weeks we received an error in ServiceWorker registration process:\r\n\r\n`Error: Rejected (Most recent call first)`\r\n\r\n`File (unknown) line 85 col 432 in ServiceWorkerContainer.<anonymous>\r\nFile (unknown) line 32 col 138 in ServiceWorkerContainer.register\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 2902094 in d._next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 315169 in d.__tryOrUnsub\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 314390 in d.next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 313561 in c._next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 313335 in c.next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 617063 in l._next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 313335 in l.next\r\nFile https://xyz.com/main-es2015.979a4121e45f0a929103.js  line 1 col 274756 in l.notifyNext`\r\n\r\nThis error happened twice already, but the catch about it is that, thanks to rollbar, we can see that it happened only in Android devices.

The\r\nngtsc compiler is implemented with the assumption that all class declarations\r\nuse a `ts.Identifier` as name, whereas the element access is using a string\r\nliteral for the declared name. This makes it troublesome for ngcc to support\r\nthis syntax form in UMD bundles.\r\n\r\nTo work around the problem, this function transforms these access expressions\r\ninto regular property accesses.

If you want to display content BEFORE the Observable emits a value you are left with using something like **else anotherTemplate**. This solves some cases, but is very limiting. Sometimes you actually want to display the content within. For example you could create a component LoadingIndicaterOverlayWrapper that greys out the actual content until a value arrives.

This appears to no longer be the case as simply removing the `width: 100%` prop seems to behave as intended.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nVisit the material.io example for radio buttons: [https://material.angular.io/components/radio/examples](https://material.angular.io/components/radio/examples)\r\n\r\nIn the second example (Pick your favorite season) where the radios are oriented vertically - observe how you can control the selected option from the right hand side of the container.\r\n\r\nVisit the material.io example for checkboxes: [https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/examples](https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/examples)\r\n\r\nIn the last example (Select your toppings) where the checkboxes are oriented vertically - observe how the hit area for a given option is only as large as its visible label.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nA radio button click area should be no wider than its visible label.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe click area for a radio button is the full width of its containing element.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 12.2.14\r\nNode: 14.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.10\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1202.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core               12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         12.2.14\r\n@angular/cdk                       12.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                       12.2.14\r\n@angular/flex-layout               12.0.0-beta.35\r\n@angular/material                  12.2.13\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular                12.2.14\r\nrxjs                               6.6.7\r\ntypescript                         4.3.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24158","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-radio-button): Click target is well outside of the visible label\" (#24158)"},{"Id":"1096597723","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-10T01:51:54","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"24175","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-experimental/mdc-list): export missing harness symbols","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24175","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-list): export missing harness symbols\" (#24175)"},{"Id":"1097317819","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-09T22:21:59","Actor":"PooSham","Number":"24178","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog) Use `align` as `@Input()` in `MatDialogActions`","State":"open","Body":"Right now we're relying on css selectors `[align='center']` and `[align='end']` for aligning action buttons in the dialog.

generating shims","State":"closed","Body":"Previously when a file was being analyzed to determine if a shim should be generated, up to two calls to the host `fileExists` function per file per generator were made. In the default host, each `fileExists` call made two underlying file system calls. Following these calls, the file was then read via `getSourceFile`. However, `getSourceFile` will return `undefined` if the requested file does not exist. As a result, `getSourceFile` can be used directly to request both potential file names and leverage the return value to determine if the file does not exist. This avoids the need to call `fileExists` at all.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47682","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(compiler-cli): minimize filesystem calls when generating shims\" (#47682)"},{"Id":"1401253824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-07T14:15:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"47692","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies to a96fc0c","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `1c1c375` -> `a96fc0c` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `5d7a73b` -> `73935dd` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `c9b2ff0` -> `db59d49` |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

The localization works btw. It does use the `lv` locale by default now but I want this to be dynamic from the url. Or if not the url, at least I'd like to see it documented on how else this dynamic lang changing can be achieved with Angular. If I can't solve this with native angular, then I will just switch to some other solution which seems counter productive to what angular would want e.g. https://www.freakyjolly.com/switch-multiple-languages-i18n-using-ngx-translate-in-angular-12/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo exception.

I am providing the request hostname to achieve that, and calling an API in my route resolver:\r\nResolver:\r\n```\r\nexport const seoResolver: ResolveFn<NgxSeo | undefined> = (\r\n  route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\r\n  state: RouterStateSnapshot,\r\n) => inject(MainService).store$?.pipe(map((store?: Store) => store?.seo));\r\n```\r\nRoute. I'm used ngx-seo, so title and metatags are set from `seo` data field. Before using a api call, everithing was working:\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: HomePageComponent,\r\n    resolve: { seo: seoResolver },\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried using a canActivate guard.\r\nGuard:\r\n```\r\nexport const seoGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\r\n  const hostname = inject(MainService).hostname;\r\n  const titleService = inject(Title);\r\n\r\n  // calling our API service like we would usually do but instead of a subscribe, we do a pipe map.\r\n  return inject(MainService).store$.pipe(\r\n    map((store?: Store) => {\r\n      if (store?.seo.title) {\r\n        titleService.setTitle(store?.seo.title);\r\n      }\r\n      return true;\r\n    }),\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\nRoute:\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: HomePageComponent,\r\n    canActivate: [seoGuard],\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of the above works for me.\r\nMy problem is that crawlers as whatsapp, facebook, an others, always saw the rendered html before the resolver finish, so I'm not getting the required tags and previews for my app. For example in [facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/echo/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fssr--la-comanda-co.us-central1.hosted.app%2F). \r\nOr checking the [source in Chorme](view-source:https://ssr--la-comanda-co.us-central1.hosted.app/).\r\nI'm deploying on the new Firebase App Service. I tried with and without prerendering and the same thing happens.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or

This bug only affects code that uses both of these features in combination. Here's an example of some affected code:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    async function test() {\n      outer: for await (const x of [Promise.resolve([0, 1])]) {\n        for (const y of x) if (y) break outer\n        throw 'fail'\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    function test() {\n      return __async(this, null, function* () {\n        outer: try {\n          for (var iter = __forAwait([Promise.resolve([0, 1])]), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n            const x = temp.value;\n            for (const y of x) if (y) break outer;\n            throw \"fail\";\n          }\n        } catch (temp) {\n          error = [temp];\n        } finally {\n          try {\n            more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n          } finally {\n            if (error)\n              throw error[0];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    function test() {\n      return __async(this, null, function* () {\n        try {\n          outer: for (var iter = __forAwait([Promise.resolve([0, 1])]), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n            const x = temp.value;\n            for (const y of x) if (y) break outer;\n            throw \"fail\";\n          }\n        } catch (temp) {\n          error = [temp];\n        } finally {\n          try {\n            more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n          } finally {\n            if (error)\n              throw error[0];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Do additional constant folding after cross-module enum inlining ([#&#8203;3416](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3416), [#&#8203;3425](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3425))\n\n    This release adds a few more cases where esbuild does constant folding after cross-module enum inlining.\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code: enum.ts\n    export enum Platform {\n      WINDOWS = 'windows',\n      MACOS = 'macos',\n      LINUX = 'linux',\n    }\n\n    // Original code: main.ts\n    import { Platform } from './enum';\n    declare const PLATFORM: string;\n    export function logPlatform() {\n      if (PLATFORM == Platform.WINDOWS) console.log('Windows');\n      else if (PLATFORM == Platform.MACOS) console.log('macOS');\n      else if (PLATFORM == Platform.LINUX) console.log('Linux');\n      else console.log('Other');\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle '--define:PLATFORM=\"macos\"' --minify --format=esm)\n    function n(){\"windows\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"Windows\"):\"macos\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"macOS\"):\"linux\"==\"macos\"?console.log(\"Linux\"):console.log(\"Other\")}export{n as logPlatform};\n\n    // New output (with --bundle '--define:PLATFORM=\"macos\"' --minify --format=esm)\n    function n(){console.log(\"macOS\")}export{n as logPlatform};\n    ```\n\n-   Pass import attributes to on-resolve plugins ([#&#8203;3384](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3384), [#&#8203;3639](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3639), [#&#8203;3646](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3646))\n\n    With this release, on-resolve plugins will now have access to the import attributes on the import via the `with` property of the arguments object. This mirrors the `with` property of the arguments object that's already passed to on-load plugins. In addition, you can now pass `with` to the `resolve()` API call which will then forward that value on to all relevant plugins. Here's an example of a plugin that can now be written:\n\n    ```js\n    const examplePlugin = {\n      name: 'Example plugin',\n      setup(build) {\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /.*/ }, args => {\n          if (args.with.type === 'external')\n            return { external: true }\n        })\n      }\n    }\n\n    require('esbuild').build({\n      stdin: {\n        contents: `\n          import foo from \"./foo\" with { type: \"external\" }\n          foo()\n        `,\n      },\n      bundle: true,\n      format: 'esm',\n      write: false,\n      plugins: [examplePlugin],\n    }).then(result => {\n      console.log(result.outputFiles[0].text)\n    })\n    ```\n\n-   Formatting support for the `@position-try` rule ([#&#8203;3773](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3773))\n\n    Chrome shipped this new CSS at-rule in version 125 as part of the [CSS anchor positioning API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api). With this release, esbuild now knows to expect a declaration list inside of the `@position-try` body block and will format it appropriately.\n\n-   Always allow internal string import and export aliases ([#&#8203;3343](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3343))\n\n    Import and export names can be string literals in ES2022+. Previously esbuild forbid any usage of these aliases when the target was below ES2022. Starting with this release, esbuild will only forbid such usage when the alias would otherwise end up in output as a string literal. String literal aliases that are only used internally in the bundle and are \"compiled away\" are no longer errors. This makes it possible to use string literal aliases with esbuild's `inject` feature even when the target is earlier than ES2022.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, since the default bundler is now `esbuild` some would consider this a regression.\r\n\r\n## Required chunks references in dynamic imported code get split in to separate chunks\r\n\r\nWhen splitting code, esbuild does not seems to properly take into account what is already statically imported (thus \"required\") and does not need to be split into a separate chunk.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this lets consider an example where we have the following 5 standalone components:\r\n\r\n- `AppComponent` (The root component which is not lazy loaded)\r\n- `Feature1Component` (A feature component lazy loaded via a dynamic import in the router)\r\n- `Feature21Component` (A feature component lazy loaded via a dynamic import in the router)\r\n- `Ui1Component` (A UI component imported statically, like a button)\r\n- `Ui2Component` (A UI component imported statically, like a button)\r\n\r\n### Chunks without Shared Components\r\n\r\nIf the `AppComponent` has a `RouterOutlet` which has separate paths `Feature1Component` and `Feature21Component` it will generate a chunk for the code shared between these components (lets call it Common Chunk). \r\n\r\nIn this case the build output is: \r\n\r\n| Initial chunk files             | Names               | \r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| chunk-YIKH6UD4.js               | -  (\"common\")  | \r\n| main-V6UA4PHT.js                | main                |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Lazy chunk files                | Names               |\r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| feature-1.component-AQEBZKLJ.js | feature-1-component |\r\n| feature-2.component-EH7EGWEP.js | feature-2-component |\r\n\r\nAnd if `Feature1Component` imports  `Ui1Component` and  `Feature21Component` imports  `Ui2Component` then code from `Ui1Component` will be bundle in `Feature1Component` and the code from `Ui2Component` will be bundle in `Feature2Component`.\r\n\r\n### Chunks with Shared Components\r\n\r\nHowever, if the `AppComponent` also imports  `Ui1Component` and  `Ui2Component` this code is now shared and will be split into separate chunks.\r\n\r\nThus the build output will now be:\r\n\r\n| Initial chunk files             | Names               | \r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| chunk-YIKH6UD4.js               | -  (\"common\")  | \r\n| main-V6UA4PHT.js                | main                |\r\n| chunk-WKA4CZR7.js               | -  (\"ui-1-component\") |\r\n| chunk-XCJUHD2B.js               | - (\"ui-2-component\") |\r\n\r\n| Lazy chunk files                | Names               |\r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| feature-1.component-AQEBZKLJ.js | feature-1-component |\r\n| feature-2.component-EH7EGWEP.js | feature-2-component |\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `Ui1Component` and  `Ui2Component` are now statically imported in the `AppComponent`, and therefore belong in this common chunk. These chunks are statically imported in the \"common\" chunk and required for the application to bootstrap but are downloaded separately.\r\n\r\nAs they are always downloaded, splitting them does not seems to have a benefit, when `Feature1Component` or  `Feature2Component` imports them, the request is cached and it should not make a difference if it over imports. \r\n\r\nHowever, splitting them does have a downside, it increases the load time. Even tho in this example the consequences of a couple of extra chunks is meaningless in larger apps the consequence is very real.\r\n\r\nIf the application produces 100 or 200 initial chunks this will have a significant impact on the initial load time and LCP. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40126819/d8bedc9b-be77-47fc-b9ca-702e5522c110)\r\n\r\nEven tho the a modern browser using http3 or http2 uses multiplexing it will still have an significant overhead downloading so many small chunks. We are currently calling this `the chunk gap`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40126819/6d8a96dc-9a8c-4877-a4f6-277514802047)\r\n\r\nAdditionally this issue will have a larger impact on older and slower devices. \r\n\r\n- [HTTP2 Support](https://caniuse.com/HTTP2)\r\n- [HTTP3 Support](https://caniuse.com/HTTP3)\r\n\r\nAdditional example of performance impact: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27321\r\n\r\n### Avoiding Code Splitting Shared Code\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to avoid additional chunking in some cases by using barrel files. \r\n\r\nFor example if we create a barrel file that exports both `Ui1Component` and `Ui2Component` and only import them via that barrel file we are able to force `esbuild` to place the shared code into the \"common\" chunk. \r\n\r\nSo using: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// ./ui/index.ts\r\n\r\nexport * from './ui-1.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-2.component';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build output will now be:\r\n\r\n| Initial chunk files             | Names               | \r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| chunk-YIKH6UD4.js               | -  (\"common\")  | \r\n| main-V6UA4PHT.js                | main                |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Lazy chunk files                | Names               |\r\n| --- | --- | \r\n| feature-1.component-AQEBZKLJ.js | feature-1-component |\r\n| feature-2.component-EH7EGWEP.js | feature-2-component |\r\n\r\n**Note** \r\n\r\nIn [`esbuild` architecture documentation](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) it explains that:\r\n\r\n> [code splitting](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#code-splitting) is implemented as an advanced form of tree shaking.\r\n\r\nThis means that doing so will partially optout of tree shaking.\r\n\r\nFor example if we add a `Ui3Component` and a `Feature3Component`.\r\n\r\nAnd we add the `Ui3Component` to the barrel file:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// ./ui/index.ts\r\n\r\nexport * from './ui-1.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-2.component';\r\nexport * from './ui-3.component';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `Ui3Component` is never imported anywhere it will not increase the initial bundle. \r\n\r\nHowever, if we reference the `Ui3Component` in `Feature3Component` (loading the `Feature3Component` in a lazy route), this will increase the initial bundle even if `Ui3Component` is not used in the `AppComponent`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChristopherPHolder/ng-esbuild-demo\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nShared Code Required in a root component or a root node of the node graph is bundle together.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.5        \r\nNode: 20.11.1              \r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.5\r\nng-packagr                      17.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Creating unnecessary excessive chunks\" (#27715)"},{"Id":"2315848474","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-24T17:00:51","Actor":"davidlj95","Number":"27714","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: update tsconfig template link aio->adev","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- **N/A** Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- **N/A** Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (a broken link in a generated file it's an issue)\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Further, the [relevant docs](https://angular.dev/reference/configs/workspace-config#assets-configuration) don't appear to reflect the current behavior of the project structure scaffolding (still references the old style of using an `assets` folder).\r\n\r\nA related [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78526073/angular-18-public-folder-asset-reference/78526502) can be found here which contains a little more detail about the issue I'm seeing.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27709","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CLI not properly setting the assets build property in a workspace\" (#27709)"},{"Id":"2313684914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T19:34:31","Actor":"cyrilletuzi","Number":"27706","RawContent":null,"Title":"web/test-runner failing when zoneless","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\ntest\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` is loading files from `zone.js/testing` even when in zoneless mode, thus resulting in `ng test` command failing.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- `ng new` (with CLI 18.0.1)\r\n- `ng test` => OK\r\n- `npm install @web/test-runner -D`\r\n- replace `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` by `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in `angular.json`\r\n- `ng test` => OK\r\n- now go zoneless:\r\n  - replace `provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true })` by `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()` in `src/app/app.config.ts`\r\n  - add `providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()]` in `configureTestingModule` in `src/app/app.component.spec.ts`\r\n  - delete `polyfills` properties (both in `build` and `test`) in `angular.json`\r\n  - optionally `npm rm zone.js` but is is not required for reproduction\r\n- `ng test` => FAIL after the timeout (error below)\r\n- add back `polyfills` properties (in `test`) in `angular.json` (and `npm install zone.js` if you removed it)\r\n- `ng test` => OK but now there are warnings:\r\n```\r\nNG0914: The application is using zoneless change detection, but is still loading Zone.js.Consider removing Zone.js to get the full benefits of zoneless.

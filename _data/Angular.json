@angular/common","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\nFor situations where I have a non-`string` value that I want to pass to a `string` input on an Angular component, I don't feel like I have a lot of good options to cleanly do that conversion _without_ binding to a method (eg. `.toString()` or `String()`).\n\nSignals (or their `OnChanges` counterpart pre-Signals) work, but it feels silly to redeclare a version of a variable as a different type:\n\n```typescript\nexport class ParentComponent {\n  readonly id = input.required<number>();\n\n  protected readonly idAsString = computed(() => this.id().toString());\n}\n```\n\nString concatenation in the template also works, but again feels a little unclean and more difficult to read:\n\n```html\n<child-component [stringInput]=\"`${id()}`\" />\n<!-- or -->\n<child-component stringInput=\"{{ id() }}\" /> \n```\n\nIt feels like it would be much more readable and clear that there's a type conversion going on with something like:\n\n```html\n<child-component [stringInput]=\"id() | string\" />\n```\n\nIt's admittedly a sort of edge-case, so I defer to you Angular elders to decide whether this use-case makes sense, or if the approaches I outlined above are sufficient.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAs mentioned above, a `StringPipe` pipe implementation that invokes `.toString()` on the provided value, living alongside all the other common pipes.\n\nIf you decide this is worth including, I'm happy to implement it :)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI guess I sort of outlined the alternatives in the explanation, but I did consider and try:\n\n- Signals (/ `OnChanges`)\n- In-template inline string coercion via `{{ }}` or `${}`\n\nThese both work for my needs, but feel less readable than `value | string`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58454","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"String Pipe in

In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-11-02T03:30:02.1064591Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1378}

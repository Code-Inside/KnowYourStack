I am working on getting an Angular zoneless based testing mount/harness together for Cypress. For the most part, I think the migration outlined in https://angular.dev/guide/zoneless works very well as I was able to play around with what this would look like in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/pull/58/commits/ec6a5fe0c338603d1c33e4073c0eb075d0eef4a0.\n\nAll the other components change detect correctly except the `app.component`, which doesn't appear to rerender after the component has been updated. Is there something I have configured incorrectly on the mentioned commit or is this a bug? I originally thought this might be due to a shallow render / real click events issue but that doesn't seem to be the case. Oddly enough, actually clicking on the button rerenders the component.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/pull/58\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n* clone/fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps\n*  checkout the `chore/angular-zoneless` branch. \n* Change directories into `angular-zoneless` and run `npm install` on at least Node `22.19.0`.\n*  Then, run `npx cypress open`, click component testing -> chrome or electron -> and then click the `app.component.cy.ts`.

At this point I got stuck... Here are the options I thought about:\n1. Change `ExtendedNumberRange` to be nested - but that's annoying as the server accepts a flat model and I want to avoid mapping as much as possible:\n```ts\nexport interface ExtendedNumberRange {\n  range: NumberRange;\n  includeMissing: boolean;\n}\n```\n2. Accept `FieldTree<ExtendedNumberRange>` and pass it as is to the number range component as is. Unfortunately it fails with a type error.\n3. Accept `FieldTree<NumberRange | ExtendedNumberRange>` but there is no way to check which type it is as `'includeMissing' in field` will be false due to proxy and anyway probably won't narrow the type correctly.\n\nSo I am stuck with option 1 which is a shame...\n\nHere is a stackblitz with option 2 which doesn't work (comment the number range component usage in extended number range component for it to run):\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/bw2bfa5z?file=src%2Fmain.ts \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSomehow allow composing form based components in a way that supports inheritance in model. Either fix option 2 types problem or somehow allow something along the lines of a `linkedForm` or maybe there is a way which I am not aware of to make 3 work with the union?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Use nesting in the form model and add a mapper from model to form model and vice versa (can be annoying when the form has a large model)\n2. Use `FormValueControl` but then validation will be inside the component and not in the schema which will cause a lot of other problems...","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65477","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal forms: Composing components without nesting the form model\" (#65477)"},{"Id":"3651884354","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T14:24:35","Actor":"hmoussaoui-epiktet","Number":"65475","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signal forms: applyEach not working","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nSchema validators not working when i use applyEach method.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-1spwcfxr_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.0\nAngular           : 21.0.0\nNode.js           : 22.15.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.6.0\nOperating System  : darwin arm64\n\n┌───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                           │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/animations               │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/build                    │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/cdk                      │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/cli                      │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/common                   │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler                 │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli             │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/core                     │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/forms                    │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/language-service         │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/material                 │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser         │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser-dynamic │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-server          │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/router                   │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ rxjs                              │ 7.8.2             │ ~7.8.0            │\n│ typescript                        │ 5.9.3             │ ~5.9.3            │\n│ vitest                            │ 4.0.12            │ ^4.0.12           │\n└───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65475","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal forms: applyEach not working\" (#65475)"},{"Id":"3651687021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T13:26:34","Actor":"kanidjar","Number":"65472","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signal Forms: Infinite loop when setting a field value in an effect","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen setting a field value in an effect, we enter in an infinite loop.\n\nBasic use-case cannot be implemented: change a field value based on another field (example: if \"a\" is dirty, set \"b\" to null)\n\n```js\n    effect(() => {\n      console.log('Effect');\n      this.myForm.a().value.set('bar');\n    });\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-pzvfb6jc?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nPage freeze.

Though this is an arbatray dropdown example, and I am sure there are other ones that could be identified. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:  20.3.7\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.9\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32385","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): Talkback cannot navigate long dropdowns\" (#32385)"},{"Id":"3644154259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T20:21:12","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"32382","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/grid): remove classes","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32382","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(aria/grid): remove classes\" (#32382)"},{"Id":"3643805715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T20:14:43","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32380","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add angular aria banner","State":"closed","Body":"* Added a banner to the CDK Listbox, Menu, Tree, and Accordion to guide users to use the new Angular Aria components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32380","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: add angular aria banner\" (#32380)"},{"Id":"3644164822","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T19:38:51","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32384","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"21.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32384","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0 release\" (#32384)"},{"Id":"3644158132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T19:37:01","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32383","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.0.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32383","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.0.0\" with changelog.\" (#32383)"},{"Id":"3643689828","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T19:29:41","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32377","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bump to v21 final","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32377","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: bump to v21 final\" (#32377)"},{"Id":"3643765714","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T19:24:36","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32378","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bump to v21 final","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32378","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: bump to v21 final\" (#32378)"},{"Id":"3643811496","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T17:54:26","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32381","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.2.14 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32381","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.2.14 release\" (#32381)"},{"Id":"3643800097","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T17:53:30","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32379","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.14\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32379","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.14\" with changelog.\" (#32379)"},{"Id":"3643628648","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T16:58:26","Actor":"erick-aguilar-palomeque","Number":"32376","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(drag-drop): cdkDropListEntered and cdkDropListExited events do not fire after scrolling when dropList is not a child of cdkScrollable container","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am experiencing an issue with the drag-and-drop functionality in a layout where the source dropList and the scrollable container are implemented as separate components, without a parent-child relationship. Even though the scrollable container uses the `cdkScrollable` directive.\n\nIn my use case, the left navigation panel contains a list of drop lists, and the source page also has its own elements. I highlight left nav items when the user drags elements over them, using the `cdkDropListEntered` and `cdkDropListExited` events to after that allow dropping those.\n\nA related issue was discussed here: [#19274](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19274). In that thread, it was suggested to use `ScrollDispatcher.register` to manually register the scrollable parent, but I tried this workaround and it did not resolve the issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-yzhpyubf\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Drag an item from the source page over the left nav items.\n2. While holding the drag, scroll the left nav panel.\n3.

Another user points out that it may be related to \"the sequence of events the CDK sends to it\", but the issue died without any proper investigation.\n\n2. **Fixes attempted**\n  - The FocusMonitor bug #25188 (Jun 2022) where `cdk-program-focused` is incorrectly applied on mouse click was marked as completed\n  - The associated PR #25232 improved focus detection, especially when a label is clicked, but it doesn’t entirely solve the visual persistence issue for all components.\n\n3. **Version testing on the Angular Material doc site**\nAfter checking each latest minor version on the material.angular.dev website: \n- For checkboxes, the issue does not appear in earlier **latest** minor versions (before v15), but is present again from v15 onward (tested in v16, v17… up to v21 RC). A few issues also indicate this bug actually existed in version like v14 but got fixed before the latest minor, hence why I couldn't check it today.\n- For radio buttons, the bug is visible from v11 to v13, was fixed in v14 (see #23807), but was reintroduced somewhen during v15 until today\n\n4. **Accessibility & UX concerns**\n  - The persistent indicator can be confusing: after clicking, the element looks like it’s still “active” or focused, which might not reflect its real state\n  - Most other libraries I've checked fade out ripples after *mouse* click, so this behavior is surprising for people used to other websites\n- According to the CSS `:focus-visible` mechanism, focus indication should ideally reflect input modality (e.g. keyboard vs mouse). The MDN spec explains that `:focus-visible` is designed to show focus rings only when useful (e.g. keyboard navigation), precisely to differentiate when focus indicators should be shown depending on input modality (y'know, on the contrary to `:focus`...).\n- Persistent focus indicators can degrade usability or cause visual noise, especially in complex UI flows (I actually got several bug reports from customers confused by it)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-dqjhk5mq?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Angular Material (e.g. version 15+)\n2. Render a component like `<mat-radio-button>` or `<mat-checkbox>`\n3. Click the element with the mouse\n4. Observe that the ripple or focus ring stays visible after the click completes\n5. Click somewhere else (outside the element) to unfocus and notice how the focus indicator disappears\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After a mouse click, the ripple/focus indicator should fade out (or be removed) even if the component remains focused.\n- The behavior should be consistent across input types: mouse clicks vs keyboard interactions\n- Persistent focus indicators should align with modern focus pseudo-attributes (`:focus` vs `:focus-visible`), showing visible indicators only when needed and not “sticking” unnecessarily after click interactions\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Ripple or focus ring remains on the component after click and only goes away when the component loses focus (when clicking away)\n- This behavior is visible on both checkboxes, radio buttons and actual buttons\n- The bug has appeared, disappeared, and reappeared across versions, suggesting regression or incomplete fix\n\n### Environment\n\nDoesn't really matter that much but here's the linked Stackblitz env.\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Firefox 145.0\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11, macOS 26\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(focus): Persistent focus/ripple indicator stays visible on click\" (#32365)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-22T03:30:02.9965015Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2295}

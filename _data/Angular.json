I have included a demo project that has two components - an Index component and a TodoDetail component. A simple CSS styling is included in the index.component.css file. The TodoDetail component makes a HTTP request to an external API using HttpClient service. While on the TodoDetail page, refresh the browser and clear browser cache, then return back to index page by clicking on the back button on the browser, depending whether you have `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` enabled or not, your dev node js SSR server should either crash or show HttpErrorResponse containing 404 Not Found error.\n\nA demo project is uploaded to github [Acme Todo](https://github.com/rabikr/acme)\n\n## To reproduce the error\n1. Run the local dev server by running the command `ng serve`.\n2. Open Chrome, navigate to home page.\n3. Open Chrome dev tool, go to network tab, select `Disable cache`.\n4. On the home page, click any one of the link.\n5. Refresh the page while on the todo detail view page. This is clear the cache.\n6. Return back to the previous page using the back button.\n7. Check server node js logs, it shows the dev server is trying to fetch .component.css.map file from the API server instead of Angular dev server.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/rabikr/acme\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR HttpErrorResponse {\n  headers: _HttpHeaders {\n    headers: Map(25) {\n      'access-control-allow-credentials' => [Array],\n      'age' => [Array],\n      'alt-svc' => [Array],\n      'cache-control' => [Array],\n      'cf-cache-status' => [Array],\n      'cf-ray' => [Array],\n      'connection' => [Array],\n      'content-length' => [Array],\n      'content-type' => [Array],\n      'date' => [Array],\n      'etag' => [Array],\n      'expires' => [Array],\n      'nel' => [Array],\n      'pragma' => [Array],\n      'report-to' => [Array],\n      'reporting-endpoints' => [Array],\n      'server' => [Array],\n      'server-timing' => [Array],\n      'vary' => [Array],\n      'via' => [Array],\n      'x-content-type-options' => [Array],\n      'x-powered-by' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-limit' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-remaining' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-reset' => [Array]\n    },\n    normalizedNames: Map(25) {\n      'access-control-allow-credentials' => 'access-control-allow-credentials',\n      'age' => 'age',\n      'alt-svc' => 'alt-svc',\n      'cache-control' => 'cache-control',\n      'cf-cache-status' => 'cf-cache-status',\n      'cf-ray' => 'cf-ray',\n      'connection' => 'connection',\n      'content-length' => 'content-length',\n      'content-type' => 'content-type',\n      'date' => 'date',\n      'etag' => 'etag',\n      'expires' => 'expires',\n      'nel' => 'nel',\n      'pragma' => 'pragma',\n      'report-to' => 'report-to',\n      'reporting-endpoints' => 'reporting-endpoints',\n      'server' => 'server',\n      'server-timing' => 'server-timing',\n      'vary' => 'vary',\n      'via' => 'via',\n      'x-content-type-options' => 'x-content-type-options',\n      'x-powered-by' => 'x-powered-by',\n      'x-ratelimit-limit' => 'x-ratelimit-limit',\n      'x-ratelimit-remaining' => 'x-ratelimit-remaining',\n      'x-ratelimit-reset' => 'x-ratelimit-reset'\n    },\n    lazyInit: undefined,\n    lazyUpdate: null\n  },\n  status: 404,\n  statusText: 'Not Found',\n  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/index.component.css.map',\n  ok: false,\n  type: undefined,\n  name: 'HttpErrorResponse',\n  message: 'Http failure response for https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/index.component.css.map: 404 Not Found',\n  error: {}\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.4\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.4\n@angular/cli                    19.1.4\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.4\n@schematics/angular             19.1.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dev server crashes if a component stylesheet contains values while the HTTP client is also enabled\" (#59691)"},{"Id":"2808171819","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-23T23:45:46","Actor":"seabasso","Number":"59690","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): Update pseudoevent created by createMouseSpecialEvent to populate `_originalEvent` property","State":"open","Body":"\r\nThis fixes an internal bug.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Most things are working smoothly so far, but I've encountered a specific case that I'm unable to handle.\n\nI'm wondering if this might be a bug since the same functionality works fine when using `NgModule`s.\n\n### Context\n\nMy goal is to inject Angular's `DecimalPipe` into a custom standalone pipe. Here's the relevant code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { DecimalPipe } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { Size, SizeStatus } from './size.model';\n\n@Pipe({ name: 'sizeLabel' })\nexport class SizeLabelPipe implements PipeTransform {\n  constructor(\n    private readonly translateService: TranslateService,\n    private readonly decimalPipe: DecimalPipe,\n  ) {}\n\n  transform(size: Size): string | null {\n    switch (size.detail) {\n      case SizeStatus.Available:\n        return this.decimalPipe.transform(size.value);\n      case SizeStatus.Unknown:\n        return '-';\n      case SizeStatus.InProgress:\n        return this.translateService.instant('IN_PROGRESS');\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEven though I provide `DecimalPipe` in the `bootstrapApplication`'s `providers`, I encounter the following runtime error:\n\n```console\nNullInjectorError: No provider for DecimalPipe!\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `DecimalPipe` should be correctly injected when provided in `bootstrapApplication`, I think.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe application throws a `NullInjectorError`, indicating that the `DecimalPipe` provider cannot be found.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nThis behavior works as expected when using `NgModule`s. Could this be a limitation or a missing feature in the standalone setup?\n\nThank you for your help! 😊\nXavier\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNullInjectorError: No provider for DecimalPipe!\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.4\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\n... forms, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.4\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.7\n@angular/cli                    19.1.4\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.41\n@angular/material               14.2.7\n@schematics/angular             19.1.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59682","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to Inject DecimalPipe in a Custom Standalone Pipe\" (#59682)"},{"Id":"2807249492","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-23T15:41:30","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59683","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): allow home to be cleaned up","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we're using the `from()` in the `adev-home` component, which allows us to invert a dependency and avoid memory leaks.

For example:\n\n```ts\nimport { BooleanInput, coerceBooleanProperty } from '@angular/cdk/coercion';\n\npublic readonly canEdit = input<boolean, BooleanInput>(false, { transform: coerceBooleanProperty });\npublic readonly canDelete = input<boolean, BooleanInput>(false, { transform: coerceBooleanProperty });\n```\n\nThis makes it easy to use the component like below, where simply the presence of an empty `canEdit` or `canDelete` attribute will set the `input` Signal's value to `true`:\n\n```html\n<my-component canEdit canDelete />\n```\n\nWhen using something like Prettier with an 80-char line length, each input defined like this becomes three lines long:\n\n```ts\n    public readonly canEdit = input(false, {\n        transform: coerceBooleanProperty,\n    });\n    public readonly canDelete = input(true, {\n        transform: coerceBooleanProperty,\n    });\n```\n\nThis is a lot of boilerplate. Ideally, I'd be able to do create a utility function like the following:\n\n```ts\nexport function booleanInput(defaultValue: boolean): InputSignalWithTransform<boolean, BooleanInput> {\n    return input(defaultValue, { transform: coerceBooleanProperty });\n}\n```\n\n```ts\npublic readonly canEdit = booleanInput(false);\npublic readonly canDelete = booleanInput(false);\n```\n\nHowever the above code isn't valid, because:\n\n`✘ [ERROR] TS-998110: Unsupported call to the input function. This function can only be called in the initializer of a class member. [plugin angular-compiler]`\n\nThat's fair, so next I figured I'd try and simplify things by doing:\n\n```ts\nconst boolTransform: InputOptionsWithTransform<boolean, BooleanInput> = {\n    transform: coerceBooleanProperty\n};\n```\n\n```ts\npublic readonly canEdit = input(false, boolTransform);\npublic readonly canDelete = input(false, boolTransform);\n```\n\nHowever this **also** isn't valid, because:\n\n`✘ [ERROR] TS-991010: Argument needs to be an object literal that is statically analyzable. [plugin angular-compiler]`\n\nI understand why both of these restrictions exist, but it would be nice to be able to avoid needing to rewrite out the entire options object for every Signal when they are all exactly the same.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI'm unsure of any knock-on effects of exposing it, but `core/src/authoring/input` contains the below function:\n\n```ts\nexport function createInputSignal<T, TransformT>(\n  initialValue: T,\n  options?: InputOptions<T, TransformT>,\n): InputSignalWithTransform<T, TransformT>;\n```\n\nIf this were exposed from `@angular/core`, it could be possible to write wrapper utilities for signals such as the `booleanInput()` example I described, or other shortcuts such as a number-based signal that has min/max values and normalizes values to be within range, etc.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAlternatively, relaxing (or expanding) the static analysis of Options objects would mean that it would be easier to repeat the same transforms/options throughout the codebase even when using the base `input`/`model`/etc functions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59676","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose `createInputSignal`, or ease restrictions on static analysis for Signal functions to reduce boilerplate\" (#59676)"},{"Id":"2805319176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-22T21:27:09","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"59674","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): fixes test timer-based test flakiness in CI","State":"closed","Body":"This converts two tests that rely on timers to use fakeAsync.

However, many signals used in practice represent a piece of state that can / should only change in a particular way - as an example a counter can be incremented, decremented and reset. In other words, there are many cases where we want to _enforce constraints_ on the possible state changes.\n\nIdeally we could collocate _state_ and _change methods_ in one cohesive unit. We do recognize the need in this area and see a couple of patterns used in practice. Opening this issue to capture the patterns we are aware of, judge interest, solicit more ideas etc.\n\n### signal creation method with custom mutation methods on a getter\n\nExample from https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59615:\n\n```typescript\nexport function createCounter(initialValue: number = 0): WritableSignal<number> & {increase: () => void; decrease: () => void; reset: () => void} {\n  const c = signal(initialValue);\n  \n  return Object.assign(c, { \n    increase: () => {\n       c.update(x => x + 1);\n    },\n    decrease: () => {\n       c.update(x => x - 1);\n    },\n    reset: () => {\n       c.set(initialValue);\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// usage\n\n@Component()\nexport class SomeCmp {\n  c = createCounter();\n\n  onClick() {\n    this.c.increase();\n    this.c.decrease();\n\n    this.c.reset();\n    this.c.set(100);\n    this.c.update(x => x + 2);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPros:\n* feels natural as have a similar API shape as a regular signal\n\nCons:\n* somewhat awkward to write\n* doesn't account for hiding / removing the default `set` / `update` methods\n\n### signal wrapped in a class with custom mutation methods\n\nExample: \n\n```typescript\nclass CounterState {\n    private _state = signal(0);\n    public state = this._state.asReadonly();\n  \n    increment() {\n        this._state.update(v => v + 1);\n    }\n\n    decrement() {\n        this._state.update(v => v - 1);\n    }\n\n    reset: () => {\n      this._state.set(0);\n    }\n}\n\n// usage\n\n@Component()\nexport class SomeCmp {\n  c = new CounterState();\n\n  onClick() {\n    this.c.increase();\n    this.c.decrease();\n\n    this.c.reset();\n    // default mutation methods removed from the public API\n    // this.c.set(100);\n    // this.c.update(x => x + 2);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPros:\n* fairly straightforward\n* can control if default set / update mutations are exposed \n\nCons:\n* somewhat verbose to write\n* requires additional property access (`c.state()` instead of `c()`) to get to the value\n* doesn't account for hiding / removing the default `set` / `update` methods","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59665","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals with custom change methods\" (#59665)"},{"Id":"2804294532","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-22T15:58:18","Actor":"thesmiler","Number":"59661","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Bluesky links","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\nLink to Bluesky in README, Footer and Navigation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [X] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Apart from the fact that I don't understand in which cases the locales are 2-letter and why, for example, “de-DE” is not also available as a 5-letter variant, there currently seems to be no documentation on the sourceLocale node of the angular.json.\n\nI have seen in another issue (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17144) that sourceLocale also accepts an object with baseHref and code in addition to a string. If you set this, the baseHref in the index.html is adjusted, but the build is still written to the “de” directory.\n\nI know, i can write a postbuild script to change directory naming from de to 'de-DE', but i'm wondering why you support to set a baseHref but not renaming the directory. Maybe there is another undocumented property to allow renaming, but except of the issue i couldn't find any information about this. \n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/i18n\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI'm missing a typed documention of the i18n node of the angular.json.

Especially if it depends on a `linkedSignal` which should always have a value.\n\n```\n  from = signal(new Date());\n  to = signal(new Date());\n\n  loadedRanges = linkedSignal<any, any[]>({\n    source: () => ({\n      value: this.resource.value()\n    }),\n    computation: (source, previous) => {\n      const previousRanges = previous?.value || [];\n      if (source.value) {\n        const newRange = {\n          from: untracked(() => this.from()),\n          to: untracked(() => this.to()),\n        };\n        return this.mergeRanges([...previousRanges, newRange]);\n      } else {\n        return previousRanges;\n      }\n    },\n  });\n\n  resource = rxResource<any[], any>({\n    request: () => {\n      const requiredRange = {\n        from: this.from(),\n        to: this.to(),\n      };\n      const ranges = untracked(() => this.loadedRanges()); // <-- here I use the untracked\n      const isLoaded = this.isRangeFullyCovered(requiredRange, ranges);\n      return isLoaded ? undefined : true;\n    },\n    loader: () => {\n      // call to the API\n      return of([]);\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nMy code was working without problems before updating (with the v19.0.1).\nAm I wrong stating that untracked should break the cycle, and the error shouldn't be triggered?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-8jm3wgx2?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: Detected cycle in computations.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.3\nNode: 18.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.2\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                              Version\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect            0.1901.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular        19.1.3\n@angular-devkit/core                 19.1.3 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics           19.1.3\n@angular/cdk                         19.1.0\n@angular/cli                         19.1.3\n@angular/fire                        19.0.0\n@angular/material                    19.1.0\n@angular/material-date-fns-adapter   19.1.0\n@schematics/angular                  19.1.3\nng-packagr                           19.0.0\nrxjs                                 7.8.1\ntypescript                           5.6.3\nzone.js                              0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59663","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Untracked() should break cycle in computations\" (#59663)"},{"Id":"2804435693","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-22T13:44:40","Actor":"exequiel09","Number":"59662","RawContent":null,"Title":"resource / rxResource with unspecified request option now calls the loader automatically","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn @manfredsteyer 's [post for resource and rxResource](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/asynchronous-resources-with-angulars-new-resource-api/#:~:text=Reload%20and%20Manual%20Loading), it's possible to manually trigger the resource by omitting the `request` property in the resource option and trigger the `reload` method to kick off the request inside the loader function.

Examples of such setups include those that use reverse proxies or custom host names during development. The change within a patch release was made by Vite to address a security vulnerability. For projects that directly access the development server via `localhost`, no changes should be needed. However, some development setups may now need to adjust the newly introduced `allowedHosts` development server option. This option can include an array of host names that are allowed to communicate with the development server. The option sets the corresponding Vite option within the Angular CLI. For more information on the option and its specific behavior, please see the Vite documentation located here:\r\nhttps://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts\r\n\r\nThe following is

version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAngular provides examples on how to use prerendering for parametrized routes like `post/:id`. However, in our project, we have routes with dynamic parameters at the beginning of the route path, such as `:seoAlias/:category/:offerId`.\n\nThis specific route structure causes issues in `Client`, `Server`, and `Prerender` modes, breaking other routes when serving the app in development mode or building the application.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nWe have created a simple reproduction repository:\n[https://github.com/robertsine/car-shop](https://github.com/robertsine/car-shop)\n\nInside the file `app.routes.server.ts` there are several route variants. By uncommenting them, you can reproduce the issue. Notably, only `offers/:slug` works well. Other server routes are breaking entire app, when serving app in dev mode or serving build.\n\nWe tried to use the `**` path as a _hack_ to prerender our parameterized routes. However, in development mode, it does not work. In build mode, it creates prerendered pages. For note, we must ensure unique parameters across the entire route configuration to avoid hitting several paths with same parameter name. However, it generates fallback content inside the index files.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Error(s) occurred while extracting routes:\n- The '' server route does not match any routes defined in the Angular routing configuration (typically provided as a part of the 'provideRouter' call).

This also allows to have many clients configured at the same time.\n\nFor the development we simply add on the OS hosts file `[CLIENT].local` and have nginx running on docker.\nThis has sped up a lot of developing time.\n\nWe are migrating from angular 16 to 19 and already preparing for the `AngularNodeAppEngine` because from what I saw in the docs it will be the default instead of the `ngExpressEngine` and `CommonEngine`.\n \nAt the moment there are (what I believe is regression) some things that worked in v16 that don't work in v19, and it impacts production and development.\n\nI was preparing a repo with an example app to list those problems, but later realized that if the APP_BASE_HREF doesn't work like before, none of the other stuff matters.\n\nThis is part of the code that we use to make it work.\n\n```typescript\n// this will garantee that all the js are served from the right routes.\nif (condition) {\n  res.render(indexHtml, {\n    req,\n    document: docWithoutBaseHref\n  });\n} else {\n  res.render(indexHtml, {\n    req,\n    providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: clientBaseHref }],\n    document: docWithBaseHref\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see by the name of the variables `docWithoutBaseHref` and `docWithBaseHref` we also manually parse the index file to add and remove the base href according to the domain and base href from the request.\n\nI look it up in the code for v19 and the base href is retrieved from the html generated on the bundling process by the `.handle(req)` method from `AngularNodeAppEngine`, this break our app because we need to put the base href that came from the SSR request, instead of reading from a static file.\n\nIs there a possibility to have this again working with Angular?\n\nWe tested with `commonEngine` and it has the same capabilities from `ngExpressEngine`.\n\nThe problem is that I don't think the angular team will maintain multiple packages, considering that the Server routes it's supported only by `AngularNodeAppEngine` and it will be the future of angular SSR and the other options will be deprecated.\n\nWe would like to know if something like this will be considered to be supported by `AngularNodeAppEngine`?\n\nWe can still keep using the packages/code that allow our customization, but this will only delay the problem and will force us to stay attached to an older version of angular. And prevent the use of new features.\n\nWe rely on this information to make a decision about how to move forward.\n\nThanks.\nCheers.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow for customization of html files from the SSR server instead of using hard coded values.\nAllow to provide dynamic base href from SSR to the rendering of an angular route.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep using an older angular version and never upgrade.\nMove to another framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29449","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \" Dynamic base href (APP_BASE_HREF) for SSR\" (#29449)"},{"Id":"2804191071","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-22T12:48:00","Actor":"kbrilla","Number":"29446","RawContent":null,"Title":"top level await could be allowed with zoneless change detection","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Description\n\nNow that zoneless change detection is slowly exiting experimental phase, would it be possible to allow by some flag configuration use of top level await? \nCurrently it is being disallowed by browser list overrides\n\n`ERROR] Top-level await is not available in the configured target environment (\"chrome131.0\" + 5 overrides)`\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAllow top level await usage\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29446","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"top level await could be allowed with zoneless change detection\" (#29446)"},{"Id":"2803471341","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-22T12:06:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29439","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.28.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.28.1` -> `v3.28.2` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.28.2`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.28.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.28.1...v3.28.2)\n\n### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n#### 3.28.2 - 21 Jan 2025\n\nNo user facing changes.\n\nSee the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/v3.28.2/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

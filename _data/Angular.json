This means ES2015 code compiled to ES5 will not work with a native implementation of Custom Elements. To support browsers that natively support Custom Elements but not ES2015 modules, we load `@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim.js`, which minimally augments the native implementation to be compatible with ES5 code.\r\n    (See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcomponents/custom-elements#es5-vs-es2015) for more details.)\r\n\r\n    Previously, the shim was included in `polyfills.ts`, which meant it was loaded in all browsers (even those supporting ES2015 modules and thus not needing the shim).\r\n\r\n    This commit moves the shim from `polyfills.ts` to a `nomodule` script tag in `index.html`. This will ensure that it is only loaded in browsers that do not support ES2015 modules and thus do not needed the shim.\r\n\r\n    NOTE:\r\n    This commit also reduces size of the polyfills bundle by ~400B (52609B --> 52215B).\r\n\r\n- **fix(docs-infra): fix angular.io on IE 11:**\r\n    Previously, the angular.io app was broken on IE 11. In particular, pages that included Custom Elements would fail to load, because the `Reflect.construct()` method (which the Custom Elements ES5 shim relies on) was not available.\r\n\r\n    This commit fixes this by loading the polyfill for `Reflect.construct()` on browsers that do not support ES2015 (including IE 11).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41184","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[11.2.x] fix(docs-infra): fix angular.io on IE 11\" (#41184)"},{"Id":"829059328","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T18:31:48","Actor":"kamilchlebek","Number":"41176","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n: `equiv-text` value is not trimmed","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/localize\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: v10\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Plurals.

This could allow `ng build --configuration production` to change the config used by other tools and affect their builds as well. This allows other tools in a project to be more intelligent about the intent of a build and do what the user expects.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThere are a couple possible implementations of this.\r\n\r\n1. Set an environment variable like `NG_BUILD_CONFIGS=\"foo,bar,baz\"`. Then config files could do something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['NG_BUILD_CONFIGS'].split(',').includes('production');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would decouple the Angular CLI from any specific tools and allow the individual tool configs to define the semantics for each configuration. Similarly, the semantics for each configuration are also defined directly in the tool's config file rather than `angular.json`. That seems weird to me, but arguably it's a benefit so :man_shrugging:. It also means that the config needs some knowledge of Angular, which isn't too bad considering its in the config, not the tool library, but this can still be undesirable.\r\n\r\n2. Add an `env` option in `angular.json`. Each configuration in the `angular.json` file could include an `env` map that looks like:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"my-project\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"env\": {\r\n              \"MY_BUILD_ENV\": \"development\",\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n        \"configurations\": {\r\n          \"production\": {\r\n            \"env\": {\r\n              \"MY_BUILD_ENV\": \"production\",\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI would parse and set the relevant environment variables during a build. Then tool configs could look for the project-specific environment variables like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['MY_BUILD_ENV'] === 'production';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would still give users full control over the semantics of any given environment variable and they can choose its value on a per-configuration basis. The challenges here include merging multiple configuration environment variables which might conflict and that this environment would apply to all tools used by the Angular CLI. Users might also break something by setting a variable they probably shouldn't (such as `PATH` or other system variables) and breaking the CLI.\r\n\r\n3. Just have users set the environment variable on the command line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nMY_BUILD_ENV=\"production\" ng build --configuration production\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use that variable in the tool config just like previously:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['MY_BUILD_ENV'] === 'production';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis requires no effort on the Angular CLI side and users can do this today. The downside here is that it requires special knowledge of how to build a particular app. A new developer would reasonably expect `ng build --configuration production` to do everything it needs to, and then be surprised something didn't optimize because they didn't set `MY_BUILD_ENV=\"production\"`. Projects could wrap such a command into an `npm run build:prod` which sets the variable, but not everyone will use it. This is also a cross platform issue, as I don't think there is a Unix and Windows compatible way of doing this (see [this question](https://superuser.com/questions/1405650/setting-environment-variables-for-windows-cmd-temporarily-to-run-a-program-in)), so supporting both environment for build is more hassle for the user.\r\n\r\nThere are likely other possible implementations that have their own trade offs. We'll need to discuss this more and come to a decision on how to move forward here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20253","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide Angular build context to external tool configuration files\" (#20253)"},{"Id":"829138055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T14:59:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"20249","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): remove `project` from required properties in ng-packagr schema","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nCloses: #20246","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20249","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): remove `project` from required properties in ng-packagr schema\" (#20249)"},{"Id":"829045961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T14:59:58","Actor":"silvioboehme","Number":"20246","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng config breaks with schema validation after library is added to workspace","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [x] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [x] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nThis works fine in version 11.2.3 and below and breaks with 11.2.4.\r\nIt's directly linked to commit 5f8155d\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nng new Demo1 --createApplication=false --newProjectRoot=apps --strict=true\r\ncd Demo1\r\nng config newProjectRoot apps\r\nng g application app1 --routing=true --style=scss  --strict=true\r\nng config newProjectRoot libs1\r\nng g library mylib1\r\nng config newProjectRoot libs2\r\n\r\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should NOT be valid.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].configurations['production']\" should have required property 'project'.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build']\" should match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBecause 5f8155d adds \"project\" key as required to \"configuration\" but ng g library don't add this key!\r\nI don't know why this is required now, but i think it's a bug in 5f8155d\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:ng-packagr\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"libs1/mylib1/tsconfig.lib.json\",\r\n            \"project\": \"libs1/mylib1/ng-package.json\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"tsConfig\": \"libs1/mylib1/tsconfig.lib.prod.json\"\r\n                                            <----- missing \"project\" !!!!!\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20246","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng config breaks with schema validation after library is added to workspace\" (#20246)"},{"Id":"829116137","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T12:42:29","Actor":"saltdotac","Number":"20248","RawContent":null,"Title":"Symbol-observable version upgrade causes typing mismatch with rxjs \"unique symbol\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

On page load the overlay connected to the origin takes whole page width\r\n2. Scroll down, so the origin is out of the viewport\r\n2. Scroll back up\r\n3. The overlay's new width is very narrow and long.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay with reposition scroll strategy returns to original size after scrolling.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nOverlay width is calculated to be unnecessary narrow and long.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 11.2.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 11.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari.\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n\r\n#### Extra information\r\n\r\n1. It seems that after scrolling the origin out of the viewport, the overlay tries to find the position that goes off-screen the least. This is positioning the popover to the right of the origin (second position provided in the position strategy config). In that case, the popover turns very narrow and long, thus the gap between the end of popover and the edge of viewport is minimal. The cdk calculates the width and height (narrow long container that you see as a result of the bug) and saves them to apply in the later step.\r\n\r\n2. Then the push in logic kicks in. When pushing cdk applies 100% width and height to the overlay and you can see how the popover now takes full width of the page after you scrolled down.\r\n\r\n3. The interesting thing happens when you scroll back up and the overlay is not pushed any longer. The overlay tries to reposition and use the first position (under the origin), but relies its calculations on the previous position. For that it takes the saved calculations from step 1 - the narrow long container. And by cdk logic, if the newly calculated width is greater than the old one, it chooses to use the old calculations. That's how we end up with the narrow container positioned under the origin in the end and can not recover from that.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22189","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(overlay): overlay width miscalculation after scroll and push\" (#22189)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2021-03-13T05:30:04.4468625Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2232}

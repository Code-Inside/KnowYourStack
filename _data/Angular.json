This feature would enhance the developer experience by providing:\n\n- A built-in ValidationErrorComponent that automatically displays validation messages based on the form's current state (e.g., touched, invalid).\n- Support for Localization, allowing error messages to be dynamically displayed in the user's preferred language using a LocalizationService.\n- Customizable error messages with options to tailor specific error message formats via a service like ValidationService.\n- Enhanced Error Handling: Developers can control whether to show a single error message or all errors for a form field.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Reusable Validation Error Component\n- Provides a standalone, configurable component that can be used with any form control.\n- Automatically detects validation errors and retrieves corresponding messages from a service.\nLocalization Support\n\n2. Integrates with Angular's internationalization (i18n) capabilities to display error messages in the user's language.\n- Allows developers to specify custom error messages for each form field using a LocalizationService.\n- Error Message Customization\n\n3. Developers can define custom validation message handlers through a ValidationService.\n- Supports advanced configurations like minimum and maximum length, pattern, and required validators.\n\n4. Flexibility in Error Display\n- Option to display either a single validation error (e.g., for a cleaner UI) or all validation errors at once.\n- The singleError input allows switching between these two behaviors.\n\nAPI Design\n#### ValidationErrorComponent Inputs\n- field: The form control to validate.\n- label: The field label, displayed in the validation message.\n- constraints: Additional validation rules (e.g., minlength, maxlength) used for customizing error messages.\n- singleError: A boolean flag that determines if only the first error should be displayed.\n\n#### ValidationService\n- Provides error message handlers for common validation errors (e.g., required, minlength, maxlength, email).\n- Integrates with a LocalizationService to fetch localized error messages.\n\n#### LocalizationService\n- Loads localized messages for validation errors.\n- Provides an observable to determine whether localized messages are available.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```\nexport class BaseComponent {\n\n  protected control(name: string): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.form?.get(name);\n  }\n}\n\nexport class SignInComponent extends BaseComponent {\n\n  public get signInForm(): FormGroup {\n    return this.form;\n  }\n\n  public get emailAddress(): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.control('emailAddress');\n  }\n\n  public get password(): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.control('password');\n  }\n\n  protected override initForm(): void {\n    this.form = this.formBuilder.group({\n      emailAddress: ['', [\n        required,\n        minLength(4),\n        maxLength(150),\n        email\n      ]],\n\n      password: ['', [\n        required,\n        minLength(8),\n        maxLength(24),\n        password()\n      ]],\n    });\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n    <form name=\"sign-in\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" [formGroup]=\"signInForm\" (ngSubmit)=\"signIn()\">\n\n      <div>\n        <label for=\"email_address\">Email Address*:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"email_address\" id=\"email_address\" formControlName=\"emailAddress\"/>\n        <validation-error label=\"Email Address\" [field]=\"emailAddress\"></validation-error>\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label for=\"password\">Password*:</label>\n        <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" formControlName=\"password\"/>\n        <validation-error label=\"Password\" [field]=\"password\"></validation-error>\n      </div>\n\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign In</button>\n    </form>\n```\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'validation-error',\n  standalone: true,\n  providers: [\n    ValidationService,\n    LocalizationService\n  ],\n  templateUrl: './validation-error.component.html',\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class ValidationErrorComponent {\n\n  protected readonly validationService: ValidationService;\n\n  public field: InputSignal<AbstractControl | null | undefined> = input.required({ alias: 'field' });\n  public constraints: InputSignal<AnyObject> = input({}, { alias: 'constraints' });\n\n  public label: InputSignal<string> = input('This field', { alias: 'label' });\n  public singleError: InputSignal<boolean> = input(false, { alias: 'single-error' });\n\n  /**\n   * Creates an instance of the class and initializes the validation service.\n   *\n   * @param {ValidationService} validationService - The service responsible for validation logic.\n   */\n  public constructor(validationService: ValidationService) {\n    this.validationService = validationService;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Retrieves all validation error messages for the current control.\n   *\n   * @returns {string[]} An array of validation error messages.\n   * If there are no errors, the array will be empty.\n   */\n  private getErrorMessages(): string[] {\n    const errors: string[] = [];\n    // Check if the control exists before attempting to gather error messages\n    if (this.controlExists) {\n      // Iterate over the control's error codes and collect their corresponding messages\n      this.controlErrorCodes.forEach((code: string): void => {\n        if (this.hasError(code)) {\n          // Add message for each error code\n          errors.push(this.getMessage(code).concat(' '));\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Return the collected error messages\n    return this.finalizeErrors(errors);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Finalizes the list of errors based on the singleError setting.\n   *\n   * If `singleError` is true and there is at least one error, only the first error\n   * is returned;

Implementing a cross-language schema is more difficult, plus JavaScript/TypeScript is what most people are using (I don't know if other language support even exists).\n\nAngular is the only remaining major framework to not have the ability for a specific TypeScript interface to be augmented:\n\n- **Solid.js**: augment `solid-js` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Vue**: augment `vue` module's `GlobalComponents`\n- **Svelte**: augment the global `svelteHTML.IntrinsicElements` or augment `svelte/elements` module's `SvelteHTMLElements`\n- **React**: augment `react` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements`\n- **Preact**: augment `preact` module's `JSX.IntrinsicElements` with the same definition as for react with react compat enabled\n- **Angular**: n/a\n\nThe usage could look this,\n\n```ts\n// `angular` module\n\nexport type GlobalCSSValues = 'inherit' | 'initial' | 'etc'\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface CSSProperties {\n\tvisibility: 'hidden' | 'visible' | 'collapse' | GlobalCSSValues\n\tdisplay: 'none' | 'block' | 'inline' | 'etc' | GlobalCSSValues\n\t// ... etc ...\n}\n\n// augmentable interface\nexport interface IntrinsicElements {\n  div: { /* ... */ }\n  button: : { /* ... */ }\n  // ... etc ...\n}\n```\n```ts\n// user code\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n    // plus generic types for Angular's special bindings can be provided out of the box (insead of the user writing them here):\n    & type Obj = {\n\t// [class.foo]= bindings\n\t[K in `class.${string}`]?: boolean\n    } & {\n\t// [style.known]= bindings\n\t[K in keyof CSSProperties as `style.${keyof CSSProperties}`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n    } & {\n\t// [style.unknown]= bindings\n\t[K in `style.${string}`]?: string\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nor similar.\n\nHere's an example of the special `style.` and `class.` binding types in TypeScript playground:\n\n[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#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)\n\n\nThe generic `style.` and `class.` stuff can be provided as a default with a helper from `angular`, for example:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      'attr.foo'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      'on.some-event'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nHeck, you could even require the syntax to match, for sake of consistency with template syntax, and it is possible thanks to TypeScript template string types:\n\n```ts\n// user code\n\nimport type {IntrinsicBindings} from 'angular'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  // user adds additional element definitions\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    'my-element': IntrinsicBindings & {\n      // this covers type checking for `[foo]=` property bindings\n      foo?: number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `[attr.foo]=` attribute bindings\n      '[attr.foo]'?: `${number}` | number\n\n      // this covers type checking for `(some-event)=` event bindings\n      '(some-event)'?: SomeEvent\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n```ts\n// and similar for the builtin props:\nexport type IntrinsicBindings = {\n  // [class.foo]= bindings\n  [K in `[class.${string}]`]?: boolean\n} & {\n  // [style.known]= bindings\n  [K in keyof CSSProperties as `[style.${keyof CSSProperties}]`]?: CSSProperties[K]\n} & {\n  // [style.unknown]= bindings\n  [K in `[style.${string}]`]?: string\n}\n```\n\nLibrary authors making custom element libraries can then make their own mapped-type helpers to map their element class properties, for example, to property, attribute, and event types, and they can even expand the `class.` and `style.` types if needed.\n\nFor example, given a class like this:\n\n```js\nimport {attribute, element, event} from 'some-lib' // For example, https://github.com/lume/element\n\nexport\n@element('my-element')\nclass MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n  @attribute foo: \"foo\" | \"bar\" = \"foo\" // the initial value when no foo attribute is set (or foo attribute is removed)\n\n  @event 'onsome-event': ((event: SomeEvent) => void) | null = null\n\n  // ... implementation omitted ...\n}\n\nclass SomeEvent extends Event { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nthen a custom element author can define their own mapped type (as they already will be doing for React, Preact, Solid, Vue, Svelte, and others) to make it easy to define element types for their specific custom element library:\n\n```ts\nimport type {ElementAttributesForAngular} from 'some-lib/vue-types'\n\ndeclare module 'angular' {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    // pick the properties to be used for Angular template types (any not listed are omitted from template type checking)\n    'my-element': ElementAttributesForAngular<MyEl, 'foo' | 'onsome-event'>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nImplement a schema, and the tooling needed to map that to TypeScript (and other language) definitions like in #12045? Good luck! I imagine that's why #12045 has been open for 8 years since 2016.\n\nA TypeScript interface would much easier to provide because TypeScript is the current foundation, and it would be immediately usable by a large amount of web developers. \n\nPeople can also use TypeScript definitions as a source for mapping to other languages, so even having just TypeScript support would be a better starting point than a more difficult schema idea.\n\nThere are already tools like [TypeScript-to-Flow](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-flow) converters, so starting with a TypeScript interface right now, would be valuable a lot more quickly than #12045.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[language-server] TypeScript interface for element definitions (including for custom elements)\" (#58483)"},{"Id":"2630872997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-02T23:58:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"58482","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): correctly add external stylesheets to ShadowDOM components","State":"open","Body":"Angular components that use ShadowDOM view encapsulation have an alternate execution path for adding component styles to the DOM that does not use the SharedStylesHost that all other view encapsulation modes leverage.

If the view starts with-out the mat label rendered, the label will get rendered but the component, 'MatFormFieldNotchedOutline\" still has the class, 'mdc-notched-outline--no-label', so the display is set to none.\n\nLooks as though if the mat-label is not there on view init it is not responsive.\n\nThe behavior works fine with fill appearance.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen mat-label gets rendered in even after init, i.e. Using a structural directive or decorator such *ngIf or @if.

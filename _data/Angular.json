Someone suggested changing it to test against a zero length consumed[] array but there was never followup to make the change. Personally I think leaving it with expecting null is fine, but the method signature for UrlMatcher needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nBug still exists in 9 RC 1.\r\n\r\nShould be: <pre><code>\r\nexport type UrlMatcher = (segments: UrlSegment[], group: UrlSegmentGroup, route: Route) =>\r\n    UrlMatchResult | null;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe implementation in recognize.ts match(...) tests the result of either the config.matcher or defaultUrlMatcher against null and throws a NotMatch(). The method signature in shared.ts for defaultUrlMatcher is correct and works, but the signature in config.ts UrlMatcher does not allow nulls to be returned.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't match documentation and results in typescript compile errors when trying to implement a custom matcher.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<pre><code>\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    matcher: (url) => {\r\n      return url.length === 1 && url[0].path.match(/\\d+/) ? \r\n         ({\r\n          consumed: url,\r\n          posParams: {\r\n            id: url[0].path\r\n          }\r\n        }) : null;\r\n    },\r\n    component: MyComponent\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nType '{ consumed: UrlSegment[]; posParams: { id: string; }; } | null' is not assignable to type 'UrlMatchResult'.\r\n        Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'UrlMatchResult'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.21\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.21\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.21\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.21\r\n@angular/material                 <error>\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.21\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.21\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.21\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34729","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Method Signature of Route Config UrlMatcher does not match Shared.ts defaultUrlMatcher\" (#34729)"},{"Id":"548314857","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-10T20:30:44","Actor":"biolauri","Number":"34731","RawContent":null,"Title":"Using :host-context with a preceding selector leads to broken CSS output","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWith `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`, using the following pattern will not generate proper CSS by Angular: `.selector :host-context()`, so preceding the `:host-context()` selector doesn't work. The output will instead have the preceding selector only in the first selector (of the two generated in the selector list).  \r\nIf it shouldn't be supported to precede `:host` or, especially, `:host-context()` by another selector, than this should be documented somewhere. `:host` itself doesn't produce any problems (despite using the same internal function) as it does not add a selector list but only a single selector. So the problem is that if a selector list is generated, the preceding selectors aren't copied for the other selectors in the list, which should be done.\r\n\r\n#### Real-world use case\r\nThe minimal reproduction isn't a use case itself, but rather using SCSS `@at-root` with `&` or the current implementation of `cdk-high-contrast` mixin (in Angular 9 Release Candidate) within a `:host-context()` will create broken CSS output.  \r\nThe following example use case might help to understand my motivation and that this isn't only a hypothetical problem: I want to set a special border in high contrast mode and all these styles depend on a parent `.foo` class:\r\n```scss\r\n:host-context(.foo) {\r\n  // Some styles\r\n\r\n  @include cdk-high-contrast() {\r\n    border: 2px white solid;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich will generate CSS output (to be parsed by Angular's View Encapsulation emulation) as follows:\r\n```scss\r\n:host-context(.foo) {\r\n  // Some styles\r\n}\r\n.cdk-high-contrast-active :host-context(.foo) {\r\n  border: 2px white solid;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm aware of the issue in the current approach of the `cdk-high-contrast` mixin, discussed in angular/components#18147. So, the behaviour of this mixin might change, but the problem with using `@at-root` together with `&` and `:host-context()` stays nevertheless.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHaving the following, simplified (output) HTML structure:\r\n```html\r\n<html class=\"cdk-high-contrast-active\">\r\n<body>\r\n  <app-component><span>Some content</span></app-component>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nThe `cdk-high-contrast-actice` class can be added manually or by using the [`HighContrastModeDetector` service](/angular/components/blob/6b7f091ebdabb8dbb413a446afec996e73469185/src/cdk/a11y/high-contrast-mode/high-contrast-mode-detector.ts#L42).\r\n\r\n`AppComponent` will need the following style files:\r\n```scss\r\n.cdk-high-contrast-active :host-context() span {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNeither an exception nor an error is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.7.3\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNope.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Using :host-context with a preceding selector leads to broken CSS output\" (#34731)"},{"Id":"547694519","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-10T19:14:44","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"34708","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): delete `ɵɵallocHostVars` instruction.","State":"closed","Body":"This PR is part of sequence of work which is meant to be reviewed together:\r\n- [#34683 - refactor(ivy): move hostVars/hostAttrs from instruction to DirectiveDef](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34683)\r\n- YOU ARE HERE => [#34708 - refactor(ivy): delete `ɵɵallocHostVars` instruction](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34708)\r\n- [#34717 - refactor(ivy): delete `ɵɵelementHostAttrs` instruction](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34708)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

(baseline).\r\n\r\nIf I build the project with `tsconfig.json` target \"es2015\" a few things do not work as I expect:\r\n\r\n1. It builds both es2015 and es5 bundles. Strangely IE11 will load both the es2015 and the es5 bundles, when I expected it to just load the es5 bundle. Chrome correctly loads just the es2015 bundle.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"ie11-loading-both-bundles\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72109101-39b63500-3389-11ea-9c5c-399d3902b68e.png\">\r\n\r\n2. The es5 bundle created when differential loading is enabled is larger than the es5 bundle created when ts.config is set to es5 and differential loading is off. In my small sample app the differences are not that large but in our production app the difference is substantial. I would have thought that the es5 differential loading bundle would be no bigger than the non differential loading use case. \r\n\r\nDifferential loading\r\n<img width=\"1407\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-app-diff-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72110982-a2071580-338d-11ea-8a23-970f84b0264c.png\">\r\n\r\nNo differential loading\r\n<img width=\"1407\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-app-diff-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72110999-ab907d80-338d-11ea-8500-914f5d788afe.png\">\r\n\r\nFrom the above images you can see that the main bundle for the base ES5 scenario is 282 but for the differential loading its 298. Again this is a small sample app, in our production app this is more pronounced.\r\n\r\n3. The bundle created produces errors when running in IE11, loading ESRI maps. Again I find this strange as I would have assumed the es5 differential loading bundle would be equivalent to the bundle created when setting ts.config to es5, which works fine.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"643\" alt=\"ie11-error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72111192-2c4f7980-338e-11ea-9586-b9897893d26a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vespertilian/ng8-ie11\r\n\r\nbuild with npm run build\r\nserve the dist build with ng run serve-dist (might need to install http-server)\r\n\r\nchange ts.config from es5 to es2015 to build the different packages. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust for the third case\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Object expected\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.22\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.21\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.22\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.22\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.21\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.22\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.22\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This request is a logical extension of the one-time **string** bindings which already exist in the new Angular.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- Regular binding -->\r\n<mat-icon [fontIcon]=\"someIconVariable\"></mat-icon>\r\n\r\n<!-- One-time binding to literal string -->\r\n<mat-icon fontIcon=\"cloud-upload\"></mat-icon>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have found the above feature of Angular to be exceptionally nice (along with many others!) and could not care less that we no longer have explicit one-time bindings to variables as they made it easy to introduce bugs and the performance gains pale in comparison to those netted by AOT compilation anyways.\r\n\r\nHowever, a common pattern in AngularJS material, as well as many of my own components, is to support empty attributes for boolean properties, which would be the same as binding to a literal `true`. I believe empty attributes are not technically valid XML, but it is a common practice in HTML where the presence of an attribute makes it truthy and the absence of the attribute makes it falsy, such as putting `required` on an `<input>`.\r\n\r\nWith my proposed change, the following two examples would be equivalent.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- This works -->\r\n<user-card [userID]=\"selectedUserID\" [showAdminControls]=\"true\"></user-card>\r\n\r\n<!-- This would be nice :^) -->\r\n<user-card [userID]=\"selectedUserID\" showAdminControls></user-card>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this feature, you can either bind a boolean to the input as usual or just include the attribute without a binding, causing Angular to set the property to `true` and then leave it alone, just as the existing one-time string literal bindings work.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSorry, but I am not familiar with the Angular source code, so I have no idea how this would be implemented. The best I can do for now is to write a pretty issue and hope it garners some attention.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTo implement this on my components, I basically just set the initial value of the property to whether the attribute is present and empty.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n// ...\r\nexport class UserCardComponent {\r\n    // ...\r\n    @Input() showAdminControls = hasEmptyAttr(this.host.nativeElement, \"showAdminControls\");\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach is tedious and requires the programmer to keep the property/attribute names in sync. AFAIK the template compiler always reports unrecognized properties it finds in the HTML but a typo in the string in the `hasEmptyAttr(...)` call would result in a subtle bug.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: one-time boolean bindings\" (#34713)"},{"Id":"547694776","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T23:14:04","Actor":"kara","Number":"34709","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(ivy): document breaking change with <select> and binding order","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #34470\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(ivy): document breaking change with <select> and binding order\" (#34709)"},{"Id":"547709713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T21:45:37","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"34711","RawContent":null,"Title":"Windows ci tests","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34711","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Windows ci tests\" (#34711)"},{"Id":"547737812","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T21:37:26","Actor":"mstuartf","Number":"34712","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: correct full stop position in providers section","State":"open","Body":"Correct the position of the full stop at the end of the limiting provider scope with components paragraph.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Check the served site printing the current `LOCALE_ID` -> \"**en-US**\" but it should be \"**de-DE**\" as it was set in the `angular.json` for the [de configuration](https://github.com/bboehm86/bug-angular-locale-id-build/blob/master/angular.json#L89) \r\n\r\n4. Open the `tsconfig.app.json` and change `\"enableIvy\": true` to ` \"enableIvy\": false`\r\n5. Run `yarn start -c de` (or `yarn build -c de`) again\r\n6.

DEV vs PROD environment) requires a rebuild of the application.\r\n\r\nThis is IMHO not acceptable, since it prevents me to reuse the same artifacts when promoting a build across DTAP environments, and impacts the portability of an application.\r\n\r\nWhile I could figure out an easy alternative for environment options and `baseHref`, with a bit of support from SSR and nginx, I couldn't work around the issues i found with `deployUrl`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be allowed to inject custom asset url resolver logic that allows to retrieve and consume the deployUrl at runtime, not only statically at buildtime. This should apply both to lazy-loaded modules and possibly to resources referenced in SASS files.\r\n\r\nPerhaps deriving the right URL of the CDN by using the value of a custom `<meta>` tag in the index.html could be a very convenient way to have it dinamically resolved by the webserver. In alternative, it should be possible to customize the provider responsible to retrieve such value at runtime, similarly to what we can do with https://angular.io/api/common/APP_BASE_HREF\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI tried a custom webpack builder and I had some success using `__webpack_public_path__` for lazy-loading of modules.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Avoiding app rebuild for a different deployUrl, dynamic deployUrl resolution at runtime\" (#16625)"},{"Id":"548067356","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-10T13:28:51","Actor":"brookhutchinson","Number":"16623","RawContent":null,"Title":"Code Coverage Report is empty","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [X] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was 8.3.21\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> After updating npm package from version 8.3.21 to 8.3.22, When I use the Angular CLI to generate a code coverage report locally the index.html inside the \"coverage\" folder does not show any file names or code coverage % statistics.

This would not have been a problem prior to https://github.com/angular/devkit/pull/692 assuming a private registry was accessible without proxy. It is also relevant to #13166 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNPM natively supports a `noproxy` setting in the `.npmrc` file that will prevent the proxy settings from being used for some specific URLs. This is incredibly useful when you have a private repository that is within your corporate network, but some packages, like `node-sass` will still need to reach to the internet to download binary files through the proxy.\r\n\r\nAssuming that your private registry is at `registry.company.com`, you can add either the full sub-domain, or even just `company.com` to the `noproxy` setting and NPM will go to the registry directly, but all calls to other URLs done by NPM will still go through the proxy.\r\n\r\nWhen using `ng update`, all calls using `npm-registry-client` will go through the proxy, even though they should be blacklisted by the `noproxy` list. This will cause calls to fail when using an enterprise proxy and a private registry that cannot be reached through the proxy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Setup a private npm repository that forwards calls to the official repository\r\n- Setup a proxy so that it is required to go through the proxy to reach the broad internet, but that the private npm repository MUST be reached directly.\r\n- Configure your `.npmrc` file like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproxy: myproxy.company.com\r\nhttps-proxy: myproxy.company.com\r\nnoproxy: company.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Attempt to update an angular project from angular@^6 to angular@^7 using `ng update`.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nAt this point, `ng update` will fail trying to parse the json file that is expected from the registry and print the html error page returned by the proxy instead. Something on the lines of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to parse JSON at column 1, unexpected token < in :\r\n<doctype HTML........\r\n  Cannot reach <insert package url here>. Timeout.\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.9\r\nNode: 13.2.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.16\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.8.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.8.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.8.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.8.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.8.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.9\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.2.5\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.21.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nRequires a private repository and proxy that cannot reach the repository.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nSince `ng-update` will run NPM install scripts after doing the `npm-registry-client` calls, it is possible to remove the proxy setting before running `ng update`, and add it back as npm starts the install process using a second console. This will work as long as the first few packages getting installed does not do any network calls in their install script. It is also an incredibly risky workaround and I would recommend anyone attempting this to delete their `node_modules` folders after the update process, set their proxy settings correctly and re-run `npm install` before moving on.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16615","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"noproxy config is not respected when running ng update\" (#16615)"},{"Id":"547384319","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T20:00:33","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16609","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): replace istanbul-instrumenter-loa…","State":"closed","Body":"…der with coverage-istanbul-loader\r\n\r\nFixes #16576 and fixes #7117","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16609","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): replace istanbul-instrumenter-loa…\" (#16609)"},{"Id":"547384075","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T19:55:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16608","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): replace istanbul-instrumenter-loa…","State":"closed","Body":"…der with coverage-istanbul-loader\r\n\r\nFixes #16576 and fixes #7117","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16608","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): replace istanbul-instrumenter-loa…\" (#16608)"},{"Id":"547416446","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T19:46:30","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16610","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser-webpack-plugin to version 2.3.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser-webpack-plugin](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin) | dependencies | patch | [`2.3.1` -> `2.3.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser-webpack-plugin/2.3.1/2.3.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;232httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev231v232-2020-01-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It still states that it uses a media query and I would like to have some information on its dependencies, which is currently located in JSDoc only.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the example isn't working, as described in #18147\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** https://next.material.angular.io/cdk/a11y/overview#targeting-high-contrast-users\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18148","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Update documentation of cdk-high-contrast (since last major rework for version 9)\" (#18148)"},{"Id":"548120105","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-10T14:48:00","Actor":"biolauri","Number":"18147","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdk-high-contrast mixin not working anymore without :host selector","State":"open","Body":"Since reworking the `cdk-high-contrast` mixin in #17378 for Angular 9, this mixin doesn't work anymore when not being used within `:host` in `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` (which is currently default).\r\n\r\nAs the new High Contrast Service adds its classes to the root of the document, the compound selector generated by the mixin relies on the class `cdk-high-contrast-active` (or any other derived target class) being outside of the ViewEncapsulation for the current component. But without using the `:host` selector around, every selector gets their component attribute for View Encapsulation.  \r\nInside `:host`, it does work as Angular's preparing ViewEncapsulation is ignoring everything before `:host`.\r\n\r\nThis should at least be documented, but I would prefer a way of handling in all cases. I'd say, it's bad practice to wrap everything in `:host`, which is a workaround currently.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the example in the current documentation doesn't work either (and the documentation is quite outdated, for which I'll add another issue).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Use `cdk-high-contrast` mixin outside of `:host` selector in Angular 9 Release Candidate\r\n2. See that its coding _is not_ applied in high contrast mode\r\n3. Use mixin within `:host` selector\r\n4.

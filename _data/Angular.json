Instead, we simply attempt to focus the element by calling\r\n`focus` on it, which will do nothing if the element is not focusable.\r\n\r\nfixes #30067","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40241","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Routerscroller\" (#40241)"},{"Id":"773091713","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-22T17:06:49","Actor":"shiftybloke","Number":"40238","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding Navigation Id generator issue","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis part of the tutorial asks a user to create a For loop to dynamically create an Id value for each item in products.ts\r\nhowever, the Id value is not created by following the steps in the tutorial and so the app fails to load information about each product when you click through to their individual pages.\r\n\r\nManually adding an Id variable to each of the products in products.ts resolves the issue, but does not allow a user to dynamically set the value with a For loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/start/start-routing\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nProperty 'id' does not exist on type '{ name: string; price: number; description: string; }'.\r\n\r\nFound in file: product-details.component.ts when inspecting this line: return product.id === Number(productIdFromRoute);\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60511512/102912418-45edb200-4475-11eb-9d2b-1e15eb1d3add.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40238","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Adding Navigation Id generator issue\" (#40238)"},{"Id":"773081024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-22T16:33:05","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"40237","RawContent":null,"Title":"Linker external source map preemptive","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40237","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Linker external source map preemptive\" (#40237)"},{"Id":"773056403","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-22T16:02:17","Actor":"H--o-l","Number":"40236","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(service-worker): Add to ErrorHandler that the error is from SW","State":"open","Body":"With Angular v11.0.4 and commit [_fix(service-worker): handle error with\r\nErrorHandler_](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39990/commits/552419d)\r\nAngular start to send all service worker registration errors to the Angular\r\nstandard `ErrorHandler.handleError()` interface, instead of logging them in the\r\nconsole.\r\n\r\nBut service worker registration errors are a lot different than other code\r\nerrors:\r\n- They are frequent, for example, they happen a lot with Chrome v84,\r\n  Chrome v85, Firefox 84, and Samsung Internet v13.\r\n- Most applications can run even without a registered service worker.\r\n\r\nUse case example:\r\n- All errors send to `ErrorHandler.handleError()` show a `window.confirm`\r\n  pop-up, so developers see the error right away during development, and users\r\n  of the application have a huge error message before trying to use a broken\r\n  application.\r\n- All errors from service worker registration are ignored, so users are not\r\n  annoyed in that case.\r\n\r\nWith the actual code, inside `ErrorHandler.handleError()`, we can't\r\ndifferentiate a service worker registration error from any other error, and\r\nservice worker registration errors are already not clear at all, so we are\r\nlosing a valuable piece of information.\r\nI propose to add a \"source\" of the error, like that service worker registration\r\nerrors are cachable inside `ErrorHandler.handleError()`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features) => too specific, no doc\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This can become a problem later on in the compilation pipeline, because we try to evaluate the value of the binding, causing something like `@HostBinding('class.foo') public true = 1;` to be treated the same as `host: {'[class.foo]': 'true'}`.\r\n\r\nWhile looking into the issue, I noticed another one that is closely related: we weren't treating quoted property names correctly. E.g. `@HostBinding('class.foo') public \"foo-bar\" = 1;` was being interpreted as `classProp('foo', ctx.foo - ctx.bar)` due to the same issue where property names were being evaluated.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve both of the issues by treating all `HostBinding` instances as if they're reading the property from `this`. E.g. the `@HostBinding('class.foo') public true = 1;` from above is now being treated as `host: {'[class.foo]': 'this.true'}` which further down the pipeline becomes `classProp('foo', ctx.true)`. This doesn't have any payload size implications for existing code, because we've always been prefixing implicit property reads with `ctx.`. If the property doesn't have an identifier that can be read using dotted access, we convert it to a quoted one (e.g. `classProp('foo', ctx['is-foo']))`.\r\n\r\nFixes #40220.\r\nFixes #40230.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40233","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): incorrectly interpreting some HostBinding names\" (#40233)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"774628605","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-25T04:55:56","Actor":"ORESoftware","Number":"19679","RawContent":null,"Title":"defaultProject field in angular.json doesnt seem to do it's job when running `ng g c xyz`","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\nng generate\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNot sure if it worked prior.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-12-24 at 8 52 53 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11139560/103119881-2fd52280-462a-11eb-8cbb-d49ad057f4fc.png)\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe generate command requires to be run in an Angular project, but a project definition could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"defaultProject\": \"desktop-main\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nis set in angular.json\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nThe generate command requires to be run in an Angular project, but a project definition could not be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.4\r\nNode: 15.3.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\nIvy Workspace: \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1100.4 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         11.0.4 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   11.0.4 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          11.0.4 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/update           0.1100.4 (cli-only)\r\n    \r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19679","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"defaultProject field in angular.json doesnt seem to do it's job when running `ng g c xyz`\" (#19679)"},{"Id":"773886142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-24T23:34:23","Actor":"matheo","Number":"19672","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependencies of 11.0.x","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\r\n\r\nlatest `@babel` packages\r\nlatest `@angular` 11.0.x packages and hashes\r\n\r\nLast night I updated my websites and `@babel/templates` was fixed to an old version\r\nso this synces the 11.0.x branch with `@angular/*` 11.0.x too,\r\nas there's a little void updating these when `master` gets the `next` version.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19672","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dependencies of 11.0.x\" (#19672)"},{"Id":"774553449","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-24T20:28:37","Actor":"Lonli-Lokli","Number":"19678","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve favicon","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\nUpdate new angular app with proper favicon support\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request?

Especially when images are referenced from css files and when the intention is running the deployed app from a subdirectory.\r\nIt is also trivially to reproduce.\r\n\r\nI tried to follow up on all of those changes with how [urls are treated](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4778#issuecomment-280798718) but the varying mix up of broken behaviour is noteworthy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n* Init project with `ng new image-test --style css --strict`\r\n* Select No for routing\r\n* Save the following image into the `src/assets` folder: https://angular.io/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.png\r\n* Replace `app.component.html` with this:\r\n```html\r\n<h1>Sample. TWO images should be displayed</h1>\r\n<div style='background: url(\"assets/angular.png\") no-repeat; width: 200px; height:200px'></div>\r\n<div class=\"the-image\"></div>\r\n```\r\n* Insert into `app.component.css` the following style:\r\n```css\r\n.the-image\r\n{\r\n    width: 200px;\r\n    height: 200px;\r\n    background: url('../assets/angular.png') no-repeat;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDepending of the type of path in the css file you get very different results. The scenario above:\r\n\r\n* `ng serve` -> works\r\n* `ng build --base-href '/image-test/'` -> angular.png is now placed in two locations at `dist/image-test` and in `dist/image-test/assets`\r\n* `ng test` -> karma dies hard. Starts chrome, chokes and dies. See error section.\r\n\r\nIf one start to mix up paths you get into different hells. I tried absolute paths in css, e.g. `/assets/angular.png`, but beside a configuration that I have to do so that karma does not choke on this, I was unable to figure out, how to run such an app from a subfolder, because during `ng build` all absolute css paths are untouched and 404 on a webserver when serving from `/image-test/` because the paths point to `/assets/angular.png` which is 404, the file is rather located at `/image-test/assets/angular.png`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n*  `ng build --base-href '/image-test/'` -> angular.png is now placed in **two** locations at the `top level` and in `assets`. Why do I need doubling the resources?\r\n\r\n* `ng test` -> karma chokes and dies with this exception:\r\n```\r\n22 12 2020 10:24:24.449:ERROR [karma-server]: UnhandledRejection: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined\r\n22 12 2020 10:24:24.449:ERROR [karma-server]: TypeError: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined\r\n    at handleRangeHeaders (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\util.js:131:21)\r\n    at processRequest (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\middleware.js:98:19)\r\n    at ready (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\util.js:53:12)\r\n    at handleRequest (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\util.js:182:5)\r\n    at d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\middleware.js:64:7\r\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\r\n    at middleware (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\webpack-dev-middleware\\lib\\middleware.js:63:12)\r\n    at d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\@angular-devkit\\build-angular\\src\\webpack\\plugins\\karma.js:288:13\r\n    at call (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:183:5)\r\n    at d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\karma\\lib\\web-server.js:24:9\r\n    at call (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:183:5)\r\n    at nullProxy (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\karma\\lib\\middleware\\proxy.js:86:52)\r\n    at call (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:239:7)\r\n    at next (d:\\image-test\\node_modules\\connect\\index.js:183:5)```\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I comment out only the css part and add this snippet to `karma.conf.js`\r\n```js\r\n proxies: {\r\n      '/assets/': '/base/src/assets/',\r\n    },\r\n    files: [\r\n      { pattern: './src/assets/**', watched: false, included: false, nocache: false, served: true }\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\nI could run ng test, with broken styles but at least with some images (the image referenced from html will work).\r\nUsing relative paths I was unable to make `ng test` run, but maybe I am just lacking some more configuration\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.5\r\nNode: 14.15.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.5\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.5\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nDeveloping on windows 10 x64 (1903)\r\n\r\nMaybe relevant: The css url `background: url('../assets/angular.png')` is compacted to `angular.png` during `ng serve`.

This prevents you adding a Bazel dependency on a library that isn't listed as a dependency in <code>package.json</code>. You can set it back to <code>False</code> if you need the old behavior.</p>\n<h4>--bazel_patch_module_resolver defaults to false</h4>\n<p>By default, we no longer patch the require() function, instead you should rely on the linker to make node modules resolvable at the standard location\nif this breaks you, the quickest fix is to flip the flag back on a nodejs_binary/nodejs_test/npm_package_bin with <code>templated_args = [&quot;--bazel_patch_module_resolver&quot;]</code>, see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/2344\">bazelbuild/rules_nodejs#2344</a> as an example.\nAnother fix is to explicitly use our runfiles helper library, see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/2341\">bazelbuild/rules_nodejs#2341</a> as an example.</p>\n<h4>karma and ts_devserver rules moved to new package @bazel/concatjs</h4>\n<p><code>packages/karma:package.bzl</code> is gone, in your WORKSPACE replace</p>\n<pre><code>load(&quot;//packages/karma:package.bzl&quot;, &quot;npm_bazel_karma_dependencies&quot;)\n<p>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

So if node is expanded it just does this:\r\n```\r\nthis._selection.add(value); // Set<T>.add(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using immutable data (from the component store) those items are always new.\r\n\r\nI tried to use `trackBy` optional function:\r\n```\r\n    this.treeControl = new FlatTreeControl<SomeEntityFlatNode, string>(\r\n      (node) => node.nodeLevel,\r\n      (node) => node.expandable, {\r\n        trackBy: (node) => node.groupPath // *** groupPath is string (it's an ID) ***\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nand for this I had to change `FlatTreeControl<SomeEntityFlatNode>` to `FlatTreeControl<SomeEntityFlatNode, string>`, otherwise it doesn't compile. But then I got the following error in the **_template_**:\r\n\r\n> Type 'FlatTreeControl<SomeEntityFlatNode, string>' is not assignable to type 'TreeControl<SomeEntityFlatNode, SomeEntityFlatNode>'\r\n\r\nHere's the template:\r\n```\r\n<mat-tree *ngIf=\"hasData$ | async\" [dataSource]=\"geoDataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\">\r\n</mat-tree>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow what?

It does make sense, since OverlayRef subscribes to `Location`'s events, not `Router`'s. But what's the point of `closeOnNavigation` option if it doesn't close on angular navigation? I've googled and haven't found an answer to my question, so I'm asking here. Why do you guys use `Location`'s events? It seems like [this code](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-ref.ts#L153) should look like\r\n```\r\n    if (this._config.disposeOnNavigation) {\r\n      this._locationChanges = this._router.events\r\n        .pipe(filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd))\r\n        .subscribe(() => this.dispose());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `this._router` is a `Router`'s instance.

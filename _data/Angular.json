Escaping `+` is necessary as the literal `+` character is interpreted by servers as an escaped space.\r\n\r\nWhile applications which have worked around this problem using a custom `HttpParameterCodec` will be unaffected, any server-side workarounds will need to be disabled following this fix.\r\n\r\nApplications that relied on query parameters with `+` to be interpreted as space on the server-side will need to be adapted. Using a space in a query parameter is perfectly legal and will be properly URL-encoded as `%20`, which most servers decode back to the space.\r\nExample: Replace `this.http.get('/api/foo', {params: {search: 'foo+bar'}})` with `this.http.get('/api/foo', {params: {search: 'foo bar'}})`, which behaves identically.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n#37385 addresses the same problem, but adds

The original proposal involved passing an explicit `<any>` as a generic argument. However, it turns out that this causes serious backwards-compatibility problems, because `any` is not the correct value type in all cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider `FormArray`:\r\n```\r\nlet c = new FormArray<any>([new FormControl(0)]);\r\nc.at(0).valueChanges.subscribe(v => {});\r\n```\r\nThis will trigger a compiler warning, because `c.at(0)` has type `any`. In fact, the correct type for `c.at(0)` is `AbstractControl<any>`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, opting out with `<any>` is not the correct solution.\r\n\r\nI discussed several possible alternatives with @alxhub, and we concluded that the best approach is to provide alises for untyped versions of the forms classes.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.21...v0.14.22)\n\n-   Preserve whitespace for token lists that look like CSS variable declarations ([#&#8203;2020](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2020))\n\n    Previously esbuild removed the whitespace after the CSS variable declaration in the following CSS:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    @&#8203;supports (--foo: ){html{background:green}}\n\n    /* Previous output */\n    @&#8203;supports (--foo:){html{background:green}}\n    ```\n\n    However, that broke rendering in Chrome as it caused Chrome to ignore the entire rule. This did not break rendering in Firefox and Safari, so there's a browser by either with Chrome or with both Firefox and Safari. In any case, esbuild now preserves whitespace after the CSS variable declaration in this case.\n\n-   Ignore legal comments when merging adjacent duplicate CSS rules ([#&#8203;2016](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2016))\n\n    This release now generates more compact minified CSS when there are legal comments in between two adjacent rules with identical content:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    a { color: red }\n    /* @&#8203;preserve */\n    b { color: red }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    a{color:red}/* @&#8203;preserve */b{color:red}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    a,b{color:red}/* @&#8203;preserve */\n    ```\n\n-   Block `onResolve` and `onLoad` until `onStart` ends ([#&#8203;1967](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1967))\n\n    This release changes the semantics of the `onStart` callback. All `onStart` callbacks from all plugins are run concurrently so that a slow plugin doesn't hold up the entire build. That's still the case. However, previously the only thing waiting for the `onStart` callbacks to finish was the end of the build. This meant that `onResolve` and/or `onLoad` callbacks could sometimes run before `onStart` had finished. This was by design but violated user expectations. With this release, all `onStart` callbacks must finish before any `onResolve` and/or `onLoad` callbacks are run.\n\n-   Add a self-referential `default` export to the JS API ([#&#8203;1897](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1897))\n\n    Some people try to use esbuild's API using `import esbuild from 'esbuild'` instead of `import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'` (i.e. using a default import instead of a namespace import). There is no `default` export so that wasn't ever intended to work. But it would work sometimes depending on which tools you used and how they were configured so some people still wrote code this way. This release tries to make that work by adding a self-referential `default` export that is equal to esbuild's module namespace object.\n\n    More detail: The published package for esbuild's JS API is in CommonJS format, although the source code for esbuild's JS API is in ESM format. The original ESM code for esbuild's JS API has no export named `default` so using a default import like this doesn't work with Babel-compatible toolchains (since they respect the semantics of the original ESM code). However, it happens to work with node-compatible toolchains because node's implementation of importing CommonJS from ESM broke compatibility with existing conventions and automatically creates a `default` export which is set to `module.exports`. This is an unfortunate compatibility headache because it means the `default` import only works sometimes. This release tries to fix this by explicitly creating a self-referential `default` export. It now doesn't matter if you do `esbuild.build()`, `esbuild.default.build()`, or `esbuild.default.default.build()` because they should all do the same thing. Hopefully this means people don't have to deal with this problem anymore.\n\n-   Handle `write` errors when esbuild's child process is killed ([#&#8203;2007](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2007))\n\n    If you type Ctrl+C in a terminal when a script that uses esbuild's JS library is running, esbuild's child process may be killed before the parent process. In that case calls to the `write()` syscall may fail with an `EPIPE` error. Previously this resulted in an uncaught exception because esbuild didn't handle this case. Starting with this release, esbuild should now catch these errors and redirect them into a general `The service was stopped` error which should be returned from whatever top-level API calls were in progress.\n\n-   Better error message when browser WASM bugs are present ([#&#8203;1863](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1863))\n\n    Safari's WebAssembly implementation appears to be broken somehow, at least when running esbuild. Sometimes this manifests as a stack overflow and sometimes as a Go panic. Previously a Go panic resulted in the error message `Can't find variable: fs` but this should now result in the Go panic being printed to the console. Using esbuild's WebAssembly library in Safari is still broken but now there's a more helpful error message.\n\n    More detail: When Go panics, it prints a stack trace to stderr (i.e. file descriptor 2). Go's WebAssembly shim calls out to node's `fs.writeSync()` function to do this, and it converts calls to `fs.writeSync()` into calls to `console.log()` in the browser by providing a shim for `fs`. However, Go's shim code stores the shim on `window.fs` in the browser. This is undesirable because it pollutes the global scope and leads to brittle code that can break if other code also uses `window.fs`. To avoid this, esbuild shadows the global object by wrapping Go's shim. But that broke bare references to `fs` since the shim is no longer stored on `window.fs`. This release now stores the shim in a local variable named `fs` so that bare references to `fs` work correctly.\n\n-   Undo incorrect dead-code elimination with destructuring ([#&#8203;1183](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1183))\n\n    Previously esbuild eliminated these statements as dead code if tree-shaking was enabled:\n\n    ```js\n    let [a] = {}\n    let { b } = null\n    ```\n\n    This is incorrect because both of these lines will throw an error when evaluated. With this release, esbuild now preserves these statements even when tree shaking is enabled.\n\n-   Update to Go 1.17.7\n\n    The version of the Go compiler used to compile esbuild has been upgraded from Go 1.17.6 to Go 1.17.7, which contains a few [compiler and security bug fixes](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.17.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>expressjs/express</summary>\n\n### [`v4.17.3`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#&#8203;4173--2022-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.17.2...4.17.3)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   deps: accepts@~1.3.8\n    -   deps: mime-types@~2.1.34\n    -   deps: negotiator@0.6.3\n-   deps: body-parser@1.19.2\n    -   deps: bytes@3.1.2\n    -   deps: qs@6.9.7\n    -   deps: raw-body@2.4.3\n-   deps: cookie@0.4.2\n-   deps: qs@6.9.7\n    -   Fix handling of `__proto__` keys\n-   pref: remove unnecessary regexp for trust proxy\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.2`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1302-httpswwwgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1301v1302-2022-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.0.1...v13.0.2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/ampproject/remapping/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2)\n\nBuilding on https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/releases/tag/v2.1.0, `LoadingContext` now provides a `depth` field so that you can track the depth of the sourcmap tree at the current load. This can be used to, eg, prevent a recursive loading scenario when transforming files in-place (where the transformed load has a sourcemap, but the child source should not).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel</summary>\n\n### [`v7.17.4`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7174-2022-02-15)\n\n[Compare

ESM compatible environment when enabling ESM output mode\n-   handle multiple alternative directories (e. g. due to `resolve.alias` or `resolve.modules`) when creating an context module\n-   add `util/types` to node.js built-in modules\n-   add `__webpack_exports_info__.<name>.canMangle` api\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix bug in chunk graph generation which leads to modules being included in chunk desprite them being already included in parent chunks\n-   avoid writing more than 2GB at once during cache serialization (as workaround for node.js/libuv bug on MacOS)\n-   fix handling of whitespaces in semver ranges when using Module Federation\n-   avoid generating hashes which contain only numbers as they likely conflict with module ids\n-   fix resource name based placeholders for data uris\n-   fix cache serialization for context elements\n-   fix passing of `stage` option when instrumenting plugins for the ProfilingPlugin\n-   fix tracking of declarations in concatenated modules to avoid conflicts\n-   fix unstable mangling of exports\n-   fix handling of `#` in paths of loaders\n-   avoid unnecessary cache update when using `experiments.buildHttp`\n\n### Contributing\n\n-   update typescript and jest\n\n### Developer Experience\n\n-   expose some additional typings for usage in webpack-cli\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**:

As in most common angular applications, we have a global stylesheet in which we import the aforementioned dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Angular v13 and its toolchain, we noticed an unexpected increase in the production mode bundle size. Inspecting the build stats, we found out that such increase was concentrated in the main `styles.css` file. With a deeper inspection in the minified file, we found out that many of the global imports were duplicated in the output stylesheet.\r\n\r\nFor us, this is a regression, since before the upgrade this duplication did not occur.\r\n\r\nThe link below brings to a Github repository where we demonstrate the issue with a simple `@angular/material` import. The branches are organized as follows:\r\n\r\n`master` -> Angular 12, works as expected\r\n`feature/angular-13` -> Angular 13, duplicate entries in built style.css\r\n\r\nWe can also provide the unminified versions of the built styles.css bundles (v12 and v13, ready to be compared). Built from the same sources, the v13 indeed does have duplicate rules, while the v12 does not.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ibanjo/angular13-duplicate-styles-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception, just an unexpected increase in the bundle size due to duplicate style rules.

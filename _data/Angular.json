'visible' : 'hidden'\" \r\n            (click)=\"addToCart(product, 1)\">Add to cart</button>\r\n\r\nThe animation is very simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const visibilityAnimation = trigger('visibilityAnimation', \r\n[\r\n  state('hidden', style({ opacity: 0 })),\r\n  state('visible', style({ opacity: 1 })),\r\n\r\n  // fade in\r\n  transition('hidden => visible', [animate('1s')]),\r\n\r\n  // fade out \r\n  transition('visible => hidden', [animate('.5s')]),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo clearly the animation state can only ever be `'visible'` or `'hidden`' and one of the defined transitions should always work.\r\n\r\nIndeed, before the list has been sorted, when adding an item, the `visible => hidden` transition is triggered as expected every time. \r\n\r\nAfter sorting the list - the `visible => hidden` or `hidden => visible` transitions aren't triggered on the next click (the button doesn't fade). However it isn't completely broken - once you click again it will work. \r\n\r\nIt is as if the state of each animation is reset to a 'null' or 'void' state. In fact if you change the transitions to be `* => hidden` and `* => visible` then the animation always works. (This is unacceptable in reality since I don't want the animation to run when the page is loaded).\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to fix this by making the list items separate components, but that doesn't work well for my actual situation.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, any similar existing issues I was able to find are related to the *ngIf (:enter / :leave) animation mechanism which does not apply here. Whether or not they are related under the hood I have no way of knowing.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50861","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Reordering of *ngFor list corrupts the current state of simple animations contained inside the item template.\" (#50861)"},{"Id":"1778595860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-28T11:04:11","Actor":"idanzror100","Number":"50870","RawContent":null,"Title":"signal compute not trigger if created in angular shared library","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nhello\r\nI have angular project that extend ts.file from angular share library\r\nwhen the signal is create in \"base share library\" then compute functions (from signal) not trigger.\r\nit will trigger only when i set \"@angular/*\" in tsconfig.json:\r\n\"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n            \"@angular/*\": [ \"./node_modules/@angular/*\" ]\r\n        }\r\n\r\nis it noraml? can you make it trigger with no add to  tsconfig.json?\r\n\r\nthank you.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.1.0\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50870","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"signal compute not trigger if created in angular shared library\" (#50870)"},{"Id":"1778601257","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-28T09:51:58","Actor":"devversion","Number":"50871","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(upgrade): allow for downgraded components to work with component-router","State":"open","Body":"In the past, we had an implementation of the \"Angular 2\" router that also worked with AngularJS.

This can provide a performance benefit for projects especially when project stylesheets contain nothing that would require prefixing since postcss processing can potentially be skipped completely.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25457","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use built-in CSS vendor prefixing in esbuild\" (#25457)"},{"Id":"1776708658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T11:28:04","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25456","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add initial support for server bundle generation using esbuild","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds initial support to generate the server bundle using esbuild as the underlying bundler.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25456","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add initial support for server bundle generation using esbuild\" (#25456)"},{"Id":"1776697678","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T11:21:14","Actor":"NatanCoralogix","Number":"25455","RawContent":null,"Title":"vite optimized change causing reloads","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n16.0.3\n\n### Description\n\nAfter upgrading to 16.1.1\r\nwhile running my app, going from page to page suddenly esbuild is reloading:\r\n\r\n2:16:03 PM [vite] ✨ new dependencies optimized: @angular/cdk/layout, highcharts/modules/solid-gauge, rxjs/internal-compatibility, nanoid\r\n2:16:03 PM [vite] ✨ optimized dependencies changed. reloading\r\n\r\n\r\non some pages, it causes reloading due to this optimization.\r\nhow can i tell vite to disable it? i dont want those reloads while im working\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nng serve\r\nworking with the app, going from page to page\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.1.1\r\nNode: 16.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1601.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      16.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core               16.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         16.1.1\r\n@angular/cdk                       16.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                       16.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout               14.0.0-beta.40\r\n@angular/material                  15.2.9\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   15.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular                16.1.1\r\nrxjs                               6.6.7\r\ntypescript                         4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25455","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"vite optimized change causing reloads\" (#25455)"},{"Id":"1776678651","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T11:16:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25454","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use built-in async generator downleveling in esbuild","State":"closed","Body":"As of esbuild v0.18.8, async generators can be downleveled when not supported.

Make sure you have both `node` and `yarn` installed.\r\n   We recommend using `nvm` to manage your node versions.\r\n2. angular/components uses Bazel which requires certain Bash and UNIX tools.\r\n   - On Windows: Follow the [instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html#installing-compilers-and-language-runtimes)\r\n   to install [`MSYS2`](https://www.msys2.org/) and the listed \"Common MSYS2 packages\".\r\n   Afterwards add `C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.\r\n3. Fork the `angular/components` repo on GitHub.\r\n4. Clone your fork to your machine with `git clone`.\r\n   Recommendation: name your git remotes `upstream` for `angular/components`\r\n   and `<your-username>` for your fork. Also see the [team git shortcuts](https://github.com/angular/components/wiki/Team-git----bash-shortcuts).\r\n5. From the root of the project, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo build angular/components in release mode, run `yarn build`. The output can be found under `dist/releases`.\r\n\r\nTo bring up a local server, run `yarn dev-app`. This will automatically watch for changes\r\nand rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI deleted %userprofile%/_bazel_%username%, but I have the same error.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ndev-app launch successful\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI have the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[0 / 1] [Prepa] BazelWorkspaceStatusAction stable-status.txt\r\nERROR: H:/projets/github/angular/components/tools/angular/BUILD.bazel:14:30: Bundling Javascript ../npm/node_modules/@angular/router/fesm2022/router.mjs [esbuild] failed: (Exit 127): _router_linked_bundle_esbuild_launcher.bat failed: error executing command bazel-out\\x64_windows-opt-exec-2B5CBBC6\\bin\\tools\\angular\\_router_linked_bundle_esbuild_launcher.bat --esbuild_args=bazel-out/x64_windows-fastbuild/bin/tools/angular/router_linked_bundle.args.json ...

AppComponent: Defines all the templates and the virtual scrolling.\r\n2. MyProvider: A directive to create a new injector containing the existing CdkVirtualScrollViewport\r\n3. MyTest: a simple test component to see if injection works as it should\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-sjp7es?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nI've also attached a Zip-File with a working sample, because for whatever reason the StackBlitz does not load the DevServer sometimes, maybe they have a hiccup.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Either download the example or open the stackblitz link\r\n2. You will see an error when starting the app, that there is no provider for CdkVirtualScrollViewport\r\n3. If you comment out the `ng-container` containing the `cdkVirtualFor` you will see, that `my-test` components outputs true, because it has an injector containing a CdkVirtualScrollViewport\r\n\r\n[Example.zip](https://github.com/angular/components/files/11855930/Example.zip)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect it to work and CdkVirtualFor actually sees the CdkVirtualScrollViewport, because it is in the Injector, as `my-test` component reports.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nError pops up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[CdkVirtualScrollViewport -> CdkVirtualScrollViewport -> CdkVirtualScrollViewport -> CdkVirtualScrollViewport]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for CdkVirtualScrollViewport!\r\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 16.1.1\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27358","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkVirtualScrollViewport): Using cdkVirtualFor in a template does not find CdkVirtualScrollViewport\" (#27358)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-06-29T03:30:02.9035549Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1795}

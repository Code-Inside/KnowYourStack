I was trying to reassign the variable I defined which I assumed was possible because the keyword is `@let` and not `@const`.  But this document seems to suggest that it's not possible.  It's confusing though.  I don't know what this snippet from the doc means: \n\n> A key difference between @let and JavaScript's let is that @let cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, Angular automatically keeps the variable's value up-to-date with the given expression.\n\nWhat is meant by \"Angular automatically keeps the variable's value up-to-date\"?  If it can't be reassigned, how would it get out of date?\n\nAlso, why in the world is it called `@let` and not `@const` if it can't be changed?

track i) {\n      <app-child [value]=\"i\" />\n    }\n</app-parent>\n```\nSee the reproduction example.\n\nI would have expected that this does not make any difference, but maybe there are reasons for it.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-pref5ps3\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nIf the child component is added in a for loop the signal query gets updated before the component inputs have been initialized, so a computed based on the signal query that wants to access the input properties will return the default value or undefined.\n\nContrary to the `Child2` components which are rendered without a for loop where the inputs are initialized and a computed can access the value of input properties as expected.\n\nIf the input is not a decorator input but a signal input also the for loop works as expected.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.11\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.10\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                          Version\n----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect        0.1902.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular    19.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core             19.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics       19.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics-cli   19.2.11\n@angular/cdk                     19.2.1\n@angular/cli                     19.2.11\n@schematics/angular              19.2.11\nng-packagr                       19.2.0\nrxjs                             7.8.2\ntypescript                       5.7.3\nzone.js                          0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61214","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"viewchildren / contentChildren gets first value before component inputs are initialized in an @for loop\" (#61214)"},{"Id":"3049403211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T15:42:10","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"61216","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): cleanup `after*` option types","State":"open","Body":"The `phase` property of `AfterRenderOptions`  was removed in #60641.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61216","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): cleanup `after*` option types\" (#61216)"},{"Id":"3049064313","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T14:32:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"61212","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: use bash syntax for `CURRENT_BRANCH` in GitHub Actions","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nReplaces incorrect use of GitHub Actions expression syntax `${{CURRENT_BRANCH }}` inside a run block with proper bash variablesyntax `$CURRENT_BRANCH`, preventing 'Unrecognized named-value' errors.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61212","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: use bash syntax for `CURRENT_BRANCH` in GitHub Actions\" (#61212)"},{"Id":"3048806118","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T12:41:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"61206","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove redundant dash in workflow file","State":"closed","Body":"This appears to the reason why the workflow is erroring out that each step is required to have `uses` or `run`\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61206","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove redundant dash in workflow file\" (#61206)"},{"Id":"3048862228","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T12:33:05","Actor":"arty-name","Number":"61208","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo instace → instance","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.3...v0.25.4)\n\n-   Add simple support for CORS to esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;4125](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4125))\n\n    Starting with version 0.25.0, esbuild's development server is no longer configured to serve cross-origin requests. This was a deliberate change to prevent any website you visit from accessing your running esbuild development server. However, this change prevented (by design) certain use cases such as \"debugging in production\" by having your production website load code from `localhost` where the esbuild development server is running.\n\n    To enable this use case, esbuild is adding a feature to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (a.k.a. CORS) for [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests). Specifically, passing your origin to the new `cors` option will now set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header when the request has a matching `Origin` header. Note that this currently only works for requests that don't send a preflight `OPTIONS` request, as esbuild's development server doesn't currently support `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n    Some examples:\n\n    -   **CLI:**\n\n            esbuild --servedir=. --cors-origin=https://example.com\n\n    -   **JS:**\n\n        ```js\n        const ctx = await esbuild.context({})\n        await ctx.serve({\n          servedir: '.',\n          cors: {\n            origin: 'https://example.com',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   **Go:**\n\n        ```go\n        ctx, _ := api.Context(api.BuildOptions{})\n        ctx.Serve(api.ServeOptions{\n          Servedir: \".\",\n          CORS: api.CORSOptions{\n            Origin: []string{\"https://example.com\"},\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    The special origin `*` can be used to allow any origin to access esbuild's development server. Note that this means any website you visit will be able to read everything served by esbuild.\n\n-   Pass through invalid URLs in source maps unmodified ([#&#8203;4169](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4169))\n\n    This fixes a regression in version 0.25.0 where `sources` in source maps that form invalid URLs were not being passed through to the output. Version 0.25.0 changed the interpretation of `sources` from file paths to URLs, which means that URL parsing can now fail. Previously URLs that couldn't be parsed were replaced with the empty string. With this release, invalid URLs in `sources` should now be passed through unmodified.\n\n-   Handle exports named `__proto__` in ES modules ([#&#8203;4162](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4162), [#&#8203;4163](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4163))\n\n    In JavaScript, the special property name `__proto__` sets the prototype when used inside an object literal. Previously esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS conversion didn't special-case the property name of exports named `__proto__` so the exported getter accidentally became the prototype of the object literal. It's unclear what this affects, if anything, but it's better practice to avoid this by using a computed property name in this case.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n###

 Add Full 24-Hour Format Support to Angular Material Time picker","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, the Angular Material Time picker component only supports a 12-hour format with AM/PM toggles. While it's possible to add custom options to simulate a 24-hour format, selecting a custom hour still causes the picker to revert back to the default 12-hour format. This creates confusion and limits usability for developers targeting regions where 24-hour time is standard.\n\n**Feature Request:**\n\nAdd a built-in configuration option to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.\n\nIn 24-hour mode:\n\nHide the AM/PM toggle.\n\nAllow direct selection of hours from 0 to 23.\n\nEnsure custom or default selections remain in 24-hour format without reverting to 12-hour view.\n\n\n**Impact:**\nThis enhancement would make the component more flexible, reliable, and inclusive, avoiding workarounds and ensuring a consistent UX for global audiences.\n\n### Use Case\n\n**Use Case:**\nMany applications (e.g., travel apps, scheduling tools, enterprise software) require accurate and consistent 24-hour time support to align with user expectations and localization standards in various regions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31042","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(COMPONENT):  Add Full 24-Hour Format Support to Angular Material Time picker\" (#31042)"},{"Id":"3047336124","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T16:32:31","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31055","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): create the grid focus behavior","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31055","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): create the grid focus behavior\" (#31055)"},{"Id":"3047224050","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T15:31:19","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31054","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove mdc-system terminology and maps","State":"closed","Body":"No-op refactor that simplifies how the m3 system tokens are created, mostly by removing some layers that were defined in MDC and no longer apply in our system.

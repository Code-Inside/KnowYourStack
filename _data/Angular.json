However, the `Location` and `LocationStrategy` abstractions are parts of the `@angular/common` package and can be used outside of the Router logic to interact with the location.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Location` and `LocationStrategy` mocks into the `BrowserTestingModule` NgModule, which is used for environment setup in TestBed. Adding the mocks there has 2 main advantages:\r\n\r\n- `Location` and `LocationStrategy` mocks will always be setup when you use TestBed (note: if you provide location mocks in the TestBed.configureTestingModule, custom mocks would still be used), which would cover cases when the `Location` is used in apps code directly.\r\n- The Router would not need to provide the mocks for abstractions that belong to the different package (`@angular/common`), which should help simplify the standalone Router APIs for testing.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47413","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-browser): include Location mocks into testing environment by default\" (#47413)"},{"Id":"1370553011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-12T21:43:56","Actor":"vyom1611","Number":"47412","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(router): moving reset assignments to resetState","State":"open","Body":"- resetting the `browserUrlTree` and resetUrlToCurrentUrlTree function moved to the `resetState` function\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

reach:\r\nrender component dynamically by importing the angular module file and pick the component type from the module declarations without the need to import the component directly. \r\n\r\nWe are using dynamic rendering for components in our app. Now as compileModuleAndAllComponentsSync is deprecated there is no angular way get a component type from an angular module file, which is needed to create a component dynamically using createComponent. \r\n\r\nWe are aware that we can directly import an angular component but this does not match our application architecture. Cause we are bundling the lazy module in each module in a file and with the direct import of a component we get a bundle component per file.\r\n\r\nNow we have a work around to access the declarations property of an NgModule by accessing the emod property, but it is probably not the appropriate way to do that. \r\n\r\nAs Angular offers different ways to render components, it would be great to consider this scenario and offer a way to dynamically import components from module file. \r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAngular should expose the declarations property in the NgModuleRef which is already loaded into emod property \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\naccessing the emod property on the imported module to allow access to the module componets types

It appears to build the first time and cache the output. Changing the file shows Angular rebuilding but it uses the old version. You have to kill ng build and start again.\r\n\r\nOur project is in single Git repository. It consists of an Angular 14 front end and a Node backed API using NestJS. We also have model folder that contains shared DTO's and utilities.\r\n\r\nThe simplified folder structure is as follows -\r\n\r\n```\r\n/\r\n angularapp\r\n    libs/\r\n       model (symlink of /model)\r\n nodeapp\r\n    libs/\r\n       model (symlink of /model)\r\n model\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have been using the structure since Angular 2 and I believe it worked up until you switch to WebPack 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create an Angular Project\r\n2. Create a folder outside the project called model\r\n3. Symlink the folder inside the Angular project eg - /angularapp/model\r\n4. Add files to the model folder.\r\n5. Do a build in watch mode\r\n6. Change the contents of a file in the model folder\r\n7. Wait for watcher to finish build\r\n8. Refresh the browser and the change will not be visible\r\n9. Cancel the watch build\r\n10. Build again\r\n11. Refresh the browser and the change will be visible.\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 14.2.1\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0 \r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23896","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Build --watch caches initial version of files in a symlinked folder.

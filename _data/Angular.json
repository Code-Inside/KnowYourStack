Also, `<mat-card>` without an `appearance` attribute defaults to `raised`.\r\n\r\nHowever, MDC migration for angular V15 always changes `<mat-card>` to `<mat-card appearance='outlined` /> (see https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24566/files#diff-b75b20ff5d2952053d36ef0a202e088d8533fb2e45be536f37973d923cdb0482). \r\n\r\nWhy is that?

Reactive Form is used. FormBuilder and FormGroup was used to create formcontrols.\r\n2. After upgrade, All material imports was updated to legacy option. (Example - MatButtonLegacy)\r\n3. In angular v10, Two-way data binding ([(ngModel)]) has been used to bind the id of the selected option, it worked fine.\r\n4. But in v15 we have tried by removing the ngModel, still not fixed.\r\n5. Have tired with [(value)] way of binding, that too didn't give a hand.\r\n6. This is not a multiple select.\r\n7. We have used exact code mentioned below in angular v10 and its not working in angular v15. Find the sample example here - https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-form\r\n\r\n**Support Needed**\r\n1. Angular support team to provide a solution to fix the issue in Mat-Select drop down.\r\n2. To provide if any code changes or import level changes has to be done.\r\n3. We have tested with angular v15.2.4 and material version as v12.2.13, all seems fine.\r\n4. Is it fine to have a downgraded material version with  higher angular version?.\r\n5. **Kindly respond whether it is a good standard to have Angular v15.2.4 and material v12.2.13 as part of production release or provide an fix for the issue in the upgraded versions for both angular and material v15.2.4.**\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly refer the below attachment which shows actual issue in the dropdown after selecting an option, the field is blank;\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"696\" alt=\"b4bc512e-f815-4e50-b949-c68a2370b082\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62600471/235129808-52abe281-fb86-475d-b6e5-b3e0698e7519.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

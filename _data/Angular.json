The components team would like to be able to provide a theme as a label to `component_benchmark` and have those styles be applied to the default index.html.\r\n\r\nI will complete this description once I have a conversation with @devversion.\r\n\r\n#### Better error handling\r\nCurrently there aren't any descriptive errors provided when `component_benchmark` is used improperly.\r\n\r\nIn particular, there is no explicit error message for when `assets` are provided without an `index.html`, which results in no `index.html` since the default one is provided as a default through the `assets` arg.\r\n\r\n#### More nuanced static asset args\r\nThe way that static assets are provided can be improved upon by allowing more specific and commonly provided static assets to be their own args. Right now if you want to provide a single static asset you must also provide your own `index.html` and cannot use the default one.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it would make sense to add an arg to separate `index.html` from `assets`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n#### Asset Injection\r\n* Use `genrule` to create `styles.css` so that you can use the transitive `styles.css`.\r\n* Provide a theme through a components `stylesUrls` and setting the component's view encapsulation to none.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Refactor component_benchmark\" (#37445)"},{"Id":"631168811","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-04T21:46:57","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"37444","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(dev-infra): use the `exec()` helper from `utils/shelljs` whenever possible","State":"open","Body":"There is an `exec()` helper provided by `utils/shelljs.ts`, which is a wrapper around ShellJS' `exec()` with some default options (currently `silent: true`).

It broke with v0.6.24.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nZoneJS has this super old legacy `Object.defineProperty` patch that basically partially re-implements\r\nthe `Object.defineProperty` functionality in order to resolve some custom elements issue. I'm confident that these issues are no longer surfacing and patching `Object.defineProperty` is not the right solution these days.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that this overwritten `Object.defineProperty` function behaves different to the native implementation. i.e. by default defined properties are not configurable. In ZoneJS, with the patched version, properties are _always_ configurable. This means that:\r\n\r\n1. The default `configurable` property descriptor attribute is not respected.\r\n2. Defined properties are by default always `configurable: true`. This doesn't match the native implementation.\r\n\r\nDue to these inconsistencies, ZoneJS could potentially hide app issues that would usually cause errors in production. e.g. when using differential loading, legacy patches might be used in tests, but not always in production. So, calling `defineProperty` multiple times in your app might work with the legacy patches in tests and legacy browsers, but otherwise cause a `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: X` error in evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\nWe saw this issue in the Angular Material test harnesses: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19440\r\n\r\nHere is the commit that introduced this logic back in the old repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/zone.js/commit/383b47905d0a55c0fd87983fa6effd0278cf70f1. And here is the commit that caused the incorrect `configurable` default, and the flag to be not respected at all: https://github.com/angular/zone.js/commit/7b7258b9bf0b4ffd944b2ae015bfb5cb045e3c05.\r\n\r\n## Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst x = {}\r\nObject.defineProperty(x, 'defaultPrevented', { get: () => true, configurable: false });\r\nconsole.error(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(x, 'defaultPrevented'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints `configurable: false` for the `defaultPrevented` property without ZoneJS. If the ZoneJS legacy patches are loaded, this is not the case though and `configurable` is always `true`.\r\n\r\n## Exception or Error\r\n\r\n`Object.defineProperty` behaves different depending on whether ZoneJS legacy patches are loaded or not. ZoneJS could **hide app failures** in tests as `Object.defineProperty` never sets `configurable: false` while in reality, defining a non-configurable property again, causes a `Cannot redeclare property X` runtime error in browsers.\r\n\r\n##  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n\r\nAngular v10.0.0-rc.2.\r\nzonejs: 0.10.\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nWe should audit if we still need this legacy patch. I'm confident, we wouldn't. I'm hoping we can remove this as it's prone to inconsistencies with the native `Object.defineProperty` behavior.

Haven't seen this work correctly yet.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using build configurations for ng build you can overwrite the default build options.  For example you set the optimization option to 'true' in the default section and overwrite it to 'false' for a local testing configuration.  Ng build works fine and you get what you would expect.  When you use ng serve and specify that configuration you end up getting a mix of the default values and the configuration values.  Specifically, you seem to get the default values set in the ng build section for options that match naming of options that exist in ng serve.  I.E.  The optimization setting when using ng serve is now 'true' instead of getting 'false'.  If you simply remove the default setting in ng build it now correctly picks up the configuration setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere is a sample angular.json stripped down to just the necessary bits.\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{\r\n    \"projects\": {\r\n        \"test\": {\r\n            \"architect\": {\r\n                \"build\": {\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"optimization\": true\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"configurations\": {\r\n                        \"local\": {\r\n                            \"optimization\": false\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                \"serve\": {\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"browserTarget\": \"test:build\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"configurations\": {\r\n                        \"local\": {\r\n                            \"browserTarget\": \"test:build:local\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen running `ng serve -c local` you end up with optimization set to true.

Also 👍 nice.\r\n\r\nso far so good !\r\n\r\n4. drag the dialog downwards (or in any direction you want) generously and minimize it again.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe dialog should be at the exact same place as it was after step 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe dialog's position has been updated, but with an additionnal translation.\r\n(That additionnal translation seems to be of the same length as the previous drag.)\r\n\r\nWorst : you can get the dialog outside of the screen if your drag was too generous, preventing you from dragging it back on visual.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.1.7 (but discovered and reproduced in 7.3.4)\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2.4 (but discovered and reproduced in 6.4.1)\r\n- Chrome 83.0.4103.61 64bits\r\n- Windows 10 64bits\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatDialogRef): updatePosition is not consistent for previously dragged dialog\" (#19539)"},{"Id":"630153991","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-04T13:43:07","Actor":"mcmessina","Number":"19529","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Dialog): Highlighting bug on Chrome","State":"closed","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nWhile following the example to create a Dialog box with an input area, clicking around the component causes strange highlighting effects in Chrome (see animation of bug below).

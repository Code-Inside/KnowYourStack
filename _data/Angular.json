That is needed whenever we need to react to a signal change without needing to use the value of that signal inside the effect. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// log the below message whenever a task is completed (assuming we have a `completedTasksCount` signal)\r\neffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Congratulations on completing the task!!\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nadd `extraDependencies` to [CreateEffectOptions](https://angular.io/api/core/CreateEffectOptions). It will be a list of signals that trigger re-execution of the effect even though they are not used inside the effect.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Congratulation on completing the task!!\")\r\n}, {extarDependencies: [completedTasksCount]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also thought this new option fits best as the last piece that complements what angular currently has:\r\n- automatic tracking of signals used inside the effect\r\n- ability to [untrack](https://angular.io/guide/signals#reading-without-tracking-dependencies) specific signals even though though they are used inside the effect\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n#### Add `dependencies` to [CreateEffectOptions](https://angular.io/api/core/CreateEffectOptions).\r\nThe new option will handle both: untracking of signals used inside the effect and tracking of signals not used inside the effect. When `dependencies` is specified, angular should disable its default behavior and only track signals specified in `dependencies`. I actually think this is a better alternative if the feature is approved for implementation. That's because it provides one API for tracking and untracking as opposed to checking the `extraDependencies` to know what forces re-execution of the effect and checking the effect body to see which signals are wrapped inside `untracked`.\r\n\r\n#### tracked(completedTasksCount)\r\nmuch like there is `untracked(counter)`, add `tracked(counter)` to trigger re-execution of the effect. My problem with it is that it can be called anywhere inside the effect. So, there is no one place to check what forces re-execution of the effect.\r\n\r\n#### Check other frontend libraries/frameworks\r\n- Solidjs [on](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#on): I went to check if solidjs has sth to deal with these use cases and `on` seemed to be the closest thing.

[`v3.3.0`](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/3.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0)\n\n> **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0\n\n##### 🚀 Improvements\n\n**Method aliases**\n\nNew methods (`glob`, `globSync`, `globStream`) have been added in addition to the current methods (default import, `sync`, `stream`), which eliminate the need to rename the method when importing. In addition, an `async` alias has been added for the default import, which makes it possible to use this packet with ESM.\n\n**Method to convert paths to globs**\n\nA new method (`convertPathToPattern`) has been added in this release to convert a path to a pattern. The primary goal is to enable users to avoid processing Windows paths in each location where this package is used by utilities from third-party packages.\n\nSee more details in the [pull request](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/392).\n\n##### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   In the past, we mishandled patterns that contained slashes when the `baseNameMatch` option was enabled, which went against the documented behavior. ([#&#8203;312](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/312))\n-   Several problems with matching patterns that contain brace expansion have been resolved.  The primary issue solved is when the pattern has duplicate slashes after it is expanded ([#&#8203;394](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/394)), or the `micromatch` package does not correctly generate a regular expression ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/365)).\n-   All negative patterns will now have the `dot` option enabled when matching paths. Previously, the `!**/*` patterns did not exclude hidden files (start with a dot). ([#&#8203;343](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/343))\n-   The issue that led to duplicates in the results when overlapping or duplicate patterns were present among the patterns has been fixed. At the moment, we are only talking about leading dot. Other cases are not included. For example, running with the patterns `['./file.md', 'file.md', '*']` will now only include `file.md` once in the results. ([#&#8203;190](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/190))\n\n##### 📖 Documentation\n\nA [clarifying note](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/blob/master/README.md#concurrency) has been added for the `concurrency` option, which provides more detailed information about the Thread Pool utilization.\n\n##### ⚙️ Infrastructure\n\n-   The benchmark in CI is now running on Node.js 20.\n-   The benchmark now uses the public package [bencho](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/bencho) instead of an in-house implementation. You may want to try this solution for your packages and provide feedback.\n\n##### 🥇 New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;josh-hemphill](https://togithub.com/josh-hemphill) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383)\n-   [@&#8203;mairaw](https://togithub.com/mairaw) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.49`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90be42511604485f6d78be5d1458ca3aa2083906...fed3738eda530454454a0ca23855f2b1cc84e3b2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90be42511604485f6d78be5d1458ca3aa2083906...fed3738eda530454454a0ca23855f2b1cc84e3b2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This can provide a performance benefit for projects especially when project stylesheets contain nothing that would require prefixing since postcss processing can potentially be skipped completely.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25457","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use built-in CSS vendor prefixing in esbuild\" (#25457)"},{"Id":"1776708658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T11:28:04","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25456","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add initial support for server bundle generation using esbuild","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds initial support to generate the server bundle using esbuild as the underlying bundler.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25456","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add initial support for server bundle generation using esbuild\" (#25456)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1786376898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T15:13:18","Actor":"spike-rabbit","Number":"27403","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/menu): sub menu with disabled items only is not closed when other sub menu is opened","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThis issue only occurs when using the menu with a keyboard. \r\n\r\nIf in a cdk menu, a sub menu is opened with ONLY disabled children, and then another sub menu is opened, that sub menu with the disabled children remains open.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-stnsdh?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. focus \"Open Menu\" button\r\n2. press space / open menu\r\n3. navigate to menu item \"With disabled child\" using arrow keys\r\n4. open sub menu by pressing arrow right\r\n5. navigate to \"With enabled child\" by pressing arrow up\r\n6. open sub menu by pressing arrow right\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSub menu with disabled child is closed\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSub menu with disabled child is NOT closed\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15\r\n- CDK/Material: 15\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27403","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/menu): sub menu with disabled items only is not closed when other sub menu is opened\" (#27403)"},{"Id":"1786186486","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T13:27:08","Actor":"elenachiosa","Number":"27402","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Slider): Page Up/ Page Down buttons increase value but not by 10 steps","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14.2.7\n\n### Description\n\nAccording to the documentation, the slider should increase the value by 10 steps when using Page Up/Page Down keys.\r\nIt instead increases/decreases by a different number of steps.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/17402311/ff4eced7-3134-4913-8a04-f086ebbc8f2c)\r\n![slidermaterialissuepageupdown](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/17402311/38a787cd-dbe2-48b4-9847-4eed9b60eef3)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: 500 Internal server error for Stackblitz.... but the issue can be reproduced on the official Material demo\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

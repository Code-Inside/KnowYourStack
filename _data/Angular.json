This PR is the beginning of our approach to make debugging dependency injection in Angular easier.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis commit introduces injector profiler callbacks in parts of the framework to emit injector events. It also introduces a default handler for these events. This default handler parses the stream of events to construct some data structures that will support new injector debug APIs. This commit introduces one of these new APIs `getInjectedServices`, which will be used by DevTools to implement some DI inspecting features. See comments in `injector-profiler.ts` for more implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Why was this implemented with a profiler?\r\n- DI maps nicely to a stream of events.\r\n- There is the possibility of making the internal `setInjectorProfiler` function a public debug API in the future, so that users can implement their own handlers to debug DI events.\r\n\r\n## Will this affect runtime performance?\r\nFor production builds no. For dev builds there is some additional overhead from the default profiler handling injector events and holding debug data in memory. Logic in these handlers is minimal, WeakMaps are used for keeping track of data and constant time lookups. No loops are performed in these handlers.\r\n\r\n## Will this affect bundle size?\r\nNo. Dead code elimination should strip all the code used by this commit.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48639","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(devtools): create profiler for injector events in dev mode\" (#48639)"},{"Id":"1518457741","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T08:08:51","Actor":"jellyzhai","Number":"48637","RawContent":null,"Title":"The function parameter index and item in the 'TrackByFunction' interface be swapped. `index` is optional","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\n```\r\ninterface TrackByFunction<T> {\r\n  <U extends T>(index: number, item: T & U): any\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn practical applications, the 'index' parameter is not commonly used, but also occupies the first parameter position, resulting in forced writing. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt is recommended that the 'index' and 'item' parameters be interchanged and changed to optional parameters\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48637","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The function parameter index and item in the 'TrackByFunction' interface be swapped. `index` is optional\" (#48637)"},{"Id":"1517834682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-03T19:39:24","Actor":"irustm","Number":"48635","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: do not use shared module","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Also the version should correspond to the version we install for building & testing.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Babel version allowed by the compiler-cli may not work given the ESM -> CJS interop. causing errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { types as t } from \"@babel/core\";\r\n         ^^^^^\r\nSyntaxError: Named export 'types' not found. The requested module '@babel/core' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.\r\nCommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:\r\n\r\nimport pkg from '@babel/core';\r\nconst { types: t } = pkg;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can only be confident about the interop if we know the version installed- is the one we test. The error above\r\ndoes not surface in integration tests because the Angular CLI brings a more recent Babel version. In components\r\nthis failed because we had an older version of Babel that breaks the NodeJS CJS/ESM interop.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\n* It previously worked because we had a \"hacky\" file to make the `@babel/core` import work (back when the repo also executed the linker code as CommonJS).  See: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/61e69c87e6b577f1c5a71fb5c39c3bd6125c4b91/packages/localize/tools/src/babel_core.ts\r\n* We cannot simply use the default import for e.g. `@babel/template` because the types are incorrect. This is a separate issue, but long-term it would be ideal to use the default import always, or have Babel ship an ESM distribution.

Some of the prominent issues I have faced with the website include:\r\n\r\n* The Tour of Heroes tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of Observables.\r\n\r\n* Instead of briefly defining some concepts before using them, the tutorial just provides hyperlinks. These concepts include the **property-binding syntax** and **Input decorator**. A reader who's learning Angular should be told what these do in addition to placing links in case the reader wants to study them extensively.\r\n\r\n* I often find myself googling some concepts which are poorly explained in the docs. For example, the documentation on `**Content Child**` says that \"Content Child is used for getting the first element or the directive matching the selector from the content DOM\". **What is the content DOM?** It doesn't say. To make things worse, it doesn't even say what  **Content Child** does in simple terms which is to **grab elements between the opening tags of a host element**. Similarly, View DOM is mentioned in the **View Child** documentation w/o stating what View DOM is.\r\n\r\n* [SUGGESTION]: There should be a tutorial on building a CRUD app like a todo app in the docs too. This would be a nice way to introduce the strengths of Angular. Plus, this is how other frameworks like React present themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Angular docs should be thoroughly revised unless it is assumed that most readers come from professional backgrounds which I doubt is the case.\r\nAngular is an interesting framework and it would be a shame if people shy away from it because the docs look scary.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48626","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Are there any plans to improve the Angular docs?

(potentially by making assumptions on what the developer wanted to accomplish). This can result in a slightly better/more convenient DX but a less clean/clear API, it could be rather convenient for example in `useAnimation`s. (It could require quite a bit of refactoring) I also think that this would make the `state`s work in a way they are not supposed to, so I personally wouldn't go with it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Animations - Adding a Dev warning for wrongly applied `state`s\" (#48625)"},{"Id":"1516416015","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-02T13:47:28","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48624","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): cleanup type any in forms tests","State":"open","Body":"Removing every type any in forms with a reference to #9100\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48624","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): cleanup type any in forms tests\" (#48624)"},{"Id":"1516136177","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-02T12:15:29","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"48620","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): combine newly-added imports in import manager","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that imports weren't being combined in the `ImportManager` when multiple new imports are added for the same file.

Prior to this, the release builds were performed using a custom build script that programmatically invoked TypeScript APIs. The Bazel build and discovery process for the releasable packages is performed by a script that is based on the scripts from components and framework repositories. Several small modifications were performed to match the behavior and structure of the cli repository:\r\n* Use of `packages` as the source root in the bazel query\r\n* Use of `pkg_npm` rule in the bazel query\r\n* Partial transition to native Node.js `fs` APIs instead of `shelljs`\r\n* Directory creation per package when copying output (supports multiple package scopes)\r\n* Copying of archives (tgz) for each package\r\n\r\nThe snapshot and local build capabilities are not modified as part of this change but will be merged in a followup as part of a larger transition to use bazel throughout the package build process.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24483","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: use bazel to perform release builds\" (#24483)"},{"Id":"1505877544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-03T16:46:36","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24462","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 4.9","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the project to TypeScript 4.9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24462","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to TypeScript 4.9\" (#24462)"},{"Id":"1517506293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-03T16:08:36","Actor":"robomike","Number":"24482","RawContent":null,"Title":"Possible Angular DevKit and RXJS mismatch","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n9\n\n### Description\n\n\"node\": \"18.12.1\",\r\n    \"npm\": \"8.19.2\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a version mismatch; for some reason, the angular/devkit depends on rjxs 6.6.7 and installs that.

To distinguish them while running, we use `*.spec.ts` for jest tests, and `*.karma-spec.ts` for karma tests. This was fine up until we upgraded to angular 15 - now there's no longer an obvious way to only load and run files with the `*.karma-spec.ts` suffix.\r\n\r\nPreviously we used code like the following in our `test.ts` file: \r\n```ts\r\ndeclare const require: {\r\n  context(path: string, deep?: boolean, filter?: RegExp): {\r\n    keys(): string[];\r\n    <T>(id: string): T;\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\n...\r\n// Find all the tests.\r\nconst context = require.context('../../', true, /\\.karma-spec\\.ts$/);\r\n// And load the modules.\r\ncontext.keys().map(context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code was removed by the migration, but I don't see a documented config option for the suffix.

To do this, we modified the following file: `@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js` and applied the following patch:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\nindex 3f469dc..eafca93 100644\r\n--- a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n@@ -245,10 +245,14 @@ async function getCommonConfig(wco) {\r\n             publicPath: (_b = buildOptions.deployUrl) !== null && _b !== void 0 ? _b : '',\r\n             filename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n             chunkFilename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n-            libraryTarget: isPlatformServer ?

Additionally, we turned off the `bundleDependencies` for the server build.\r\n\r\nThe command looks like this:\r\n```sh\r\nENV=$ENV \\\r\nIS_DEV_APP=true \\\r\nLOCALHOST_APP=$PROJECT \\\r\nIGNORE_MISSING_APPS=true\\\r\nNG_PERSISTENT_BUILD_CACHE=1 \\\r\nNODE_OPTIONS=\"--experimental-specifier-resolution=node --max_old_space_size=25600 --loader ./scripts/esm-interop/esm-main-loader.mjs\" \\\r\nTS_NODE_PROJECT=\"./src/tsconfig.$PROJECT.server.json\" \\\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ng run $PROJECT:serve-ssr${CONFIGURATION} $BUILD_ARGS\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What we have encountered with\r\nHowever, upon attempting to build the application, we encountered an issue where Node.js is unable to import the correct bundle from the package.json file. It appears that Node.js is trying to use the \"main\" field in the package.json file, which refers to the legacy resolver, instead of the bundle that was built using the Angular Compatibility Compiler. The following error is thrown at runtime:\r\n```\r\nnode:internal/errors:464\r\n    ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nError [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs not supported.\r\nInstead change the require of /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.\r\n    at /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:2:76\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:5:2)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 0) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_REQUIRE_ESM'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What else we have tried\r\nAs a potential solution, we tried to use the `@angular/tools/esm-interop/*` module loader that was pushed a few days ago. However, this caused other issues during the build. When we were trying to troubleshoot this issue, we saw that the `globby` variable was undefined in the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/dist/index.js`. We also noticed that at the end of the compilation, `this.debug(...)` is undefined in the `./node_modules/minimatch/minimatch.js` file. There is a problem with the sub `node_modules/` resolution. Basically, the current implementation of `esm-interop` module won't look into the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/node_modules/` folder in this case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@angular/material               14.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.0.3\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24461","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support running ESM for SSR\" (#24461)"},{"Id":"1504303509","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-20T10:08:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24459","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): remove unused local variables","State":"open","Body":"`messages` is unused from the spec and thus can be removed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@schematics/angular): remove unused local variables\" (#24459)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1519424002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T18:45:33","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26365","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): add aria values to slider inputs","State":"open","Body":"Related to issue #23607","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26365","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): add aria values to slider inputs\" (#26365)"},{"Id":"1519260840","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T16:29:25","Actor":"diuming","Number":"26364","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(Form-Field): custom more compact form-field without label and hint using density?","State":"open","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to custom more compact form-field?\r\n\r\n.my-mat-form-field-density-5 is working.\r\n.my-mat-form-field-density-8 not working.\r\nSassError: \"mdc-density: height must be between 36px and 56px (inclusive), but received 24px.\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-form-field class=\"my-mat-form-field-density-8\">\r\n       <input matInput  [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\r\n </mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin my-form-field-density($density) {\r\n    $field-typography: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n        $body-1: mat.define-typography-level(12px, 24px, 400),\r\n    );\r\n    @include mat.typography-level($field-typography, 'body-1');\r\n    @include mat.form-field-density($density);\r\n    margin-bottom: -18px;

As each client might have multiple environment I set each client assets in a common build configurations as it's persistent across environments and use multiple configuration for ng serve. For example\n```JSON\n\"clientA\": {\n    \"assets\": [\n        \"src/favicon.ico\",\n        {\n            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n            \"input\": \"src/environments/clientA/assets/\",\n            \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n            \"input\": \"src/assets/\",\n            \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n        }\n    ]\n},\n\"clientA-staging\": {\n    \"fileReplacements\": [\n        {\n            \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\n            \"with\": \"src/environments/clientA/environment.staging.ts\"\n        }\n    ]\n},\n```\nServing clientA is used with `ng serve configuration clientA,clientA-staging`. For some reason seems like the assets from `src/environments/clientA/assets/` are not included and I see that the browser get 404 error when trying to download an asset from there.\nWhat makes me think it is a bug with `ng serve` is that when building the app using  `ng build configuration clientA,clientA-staging` I see the assets from `src/environments/clientA/assets/` are included in the build under the assets folder and that everything working as expected when serving the produced build in a docker.\nAlso note that when changing the order and running `ng serve configuration clientA-staging,clientA` everything working as expected.\nWhen used `ng serve configuration clientA,clientA-staging --verbose` to try see some logs I see the log `GET /assets/images/brand-logo-light.svg because the client does not accept HTML.` ( `brand-logo-light.svg` is originated from `src/environments/clientA/assets/`) but I really cant tell if it's related.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate similar build configuration hierarchy as described.\nTry serving the app using ng serve with multiple configurations.\nSee if the assets are shown correctly.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.5\nNode: 18.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.5\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, localize, material, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.5\n@schematics/angular             18.2.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28914","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multiple configurations assets issue with ng serve\" (#28914)"},{"Id":"2677601827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T00:10:31","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28913","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): add initial infrastructure to support inline template HMR","State":"open","Body":"The Angular AOT compilation logic for a rebuild has been updated to include infrastructure for additional checks of stale TypeScript files against updated files.

This throws because of the `--max-old-space-size` V8 flag that I pass in to `node`.\n\nI traced the problem to this [PR#28758](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28758/files#diff-744ed3f38c651cf22c6347667c25646ae515662169495b75438a262757e3b476R63) which uses `process.execArgv` and passes them in as `execArgv` to the `options` of the newly-created worker. Later on `piscina` will spawn a worker with the provided options, without doing any filtering, but I figured this is the intended behavior on their part. \n\nAccording to `nodejs` when spawning worker threads, we cannot pass in any V8 flags ([ref](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options)). Also, there's an open issue https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41103 to make worker threads stop throwing errors for unsupported options but until that is resolved my best guess is that if `process.execArgv` is to be used, then some sort of filtering should be applied on these options before passing them in to the worker's constructor.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1, Create a new application with `@angular/cli@19`.\n2.

Integrating Angular with Deno 2.0 would provide developers with a modern, secure, and efficient runtime for building Angular applications.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- Update the Angular CLI to support Deno 2.0 for project scaffolding, building, and serving applications.\n- Ensure that @angular/core and related packages are compatible with Deno's module system and runtime APIs.\n- Provide documentation and examples demonstrating how to develop, build, and deploy Angular applications using Deno 2.0.\n\nImplementing these changes would expand Angular's versatility and offer developers more choices in their development environments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nBefore proposing official support for Deno 2.0 in Angular, I explored the following alternatives:\n\n1. **Manual Configuration:** Attempted to manually configure Angular projects to run on Deno by adjusting build scripts and dependencies. However, this approach proved complex and error-prone, leading to maintenance challenges.\n2. **Community Plugins:** Searched for community-developed plugins or tools that facilitate Angular's integration with Deno. While some experimental solutions exist, they lack comprehensive support and are not actively maintained.\n3. **Alternative Frameworks:** Considered using other frameworks that natively support Deno. However, this would require significant refactoring of existing Angular applications and retraining of development teams.\n\nThese alternatives highlighted the need for official support to ensure a seamless and reliable integration of Angular with Deno 2.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28884","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for Deno 2.0 in Angular\" (#28884)"},{"Id":"2672736646","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T16:19:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28895","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28895","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.0 release\" (#28895)"},{"Id":"2672725638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T16:14:55","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28894","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28894","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.0\" with changelog.\" (#28894)"},{"Id":"2672567961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T15:32:57","Actor":"ocombe","Number":"28893","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSR returns ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH with a specific style","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv18.x\n\n### Description\n\nA very specific style in the template of a component triggers an error `ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH` in chrome when trying to serve it with SSR.

is considered part of the accordion item's name. (This also makes it [invalid to put interactive elements inside the accordion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#all_descendants_are_presentational).)\n- The accordion items are focusable, but there's no way to open/close them using the keyboard.\n\nThe code should probably look more like the [WAI-ARIA accordion example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/), where the _header_ (not the entire accordion item) is a `<button>` that gets the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes.

The current example uses the &lt;table&gt; tag, but it should be using &lt;mat-table&gt; instead. This discrepancy may cause confusion for new developers who rely on the documentation for accurate guidance.\n\nProblem Details:\nOn the [Angular Material mat-table documentation page](https://v13.material.angular.io/components/table/overview), the code examples use the standard '&lt;table&gt;' tag, which does not support Angular Material's dataSource binding. New developers might encounter errors like \"Can't bind to 'dataSource' since it isn't a known property of 'table'\" if they follow the provided example as-is.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe documentation should demonstrate the proper usage of &lt;mat-table&gt; instead of &lt;table&gt;. Updating the examples to reflect the correct component will make the documentation more accurate and prevent confusion for developers.\n\nSuggestion:\nReplace instances of &lt;table&gt; with &lt;mat-table&gt; in the code examples, ensuring that all Angular Material features, like dataSource binding, are correctly showcased. This will provide developers with working examples that do not require additional troubleshooting.\n\nAdditional Context:\nMany developers are finding the correct solution only after searching online, as seen in this [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50228138/cant-bind-to-datasource-since-it-isnt-a-known-property-of-table).

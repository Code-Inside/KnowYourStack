(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next5-2024-04-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-next.4...18.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   The deprecated `isPlatformWorkerUi` and `isPlatformWorkerApp` have been removed without replacement, as they serve no purpose since the removal of the WebWorker platform.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Angular only supports writable expressions inside of two-way bindings.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular will ensure change detection runs, even when the state update originates from\n    outside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\n    detection compared to the previous behavior.\n\n    This change will be more likely to impact existing unit tests.\n    This should usually be seen as more correct and the test should be updated,\n    but in cases where it is too much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the `TestBed` providers.\n\n    Similarly, applications which may want to update state outside the zone\n    and *not* trigger change detection can add\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the providers in `bootstrapApplication` or add\n    `schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly` to the\n    `BootstrapOptions` of `bootstrapModule`.\n-   Testability methods `increasePendingRequestCount`,\n    `decreasePendingRequestCount` and `getPendingRequestCount` have been\n    removed. This information is tracked with zones.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [3b0de30b37](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3b0de30b37f558d4815ca9a61db1010aaf3df068) | refactor | remove deprecated `isPlatformWorkerApp` and `isPlatformWorkerUi` API ([#&#8203;55302](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55302)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7d5bc1c628](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7d5bc1c62870d9c68e06eddec229a9b8988e92ee) | fix | remove container index from conditional instruction ([#&#8203;55190](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55190)) |\n| [4eb0165750](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4eb0165750d8c65812502343a70ef4cc35c725b9) | fix | remove support for unassignable expressions in two-way bindings ([#&#8203;55342](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55342)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fdd560ea14](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fdd560ea14f2f35608e26102c7fac0471a634b3e) | feat | Add ability to configure zone change detection to use zoneless scheduler ([#&#8203;55252](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55252)) |\n| [bce5e2344f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bce5e2344f312dc3a8a30d54e412958bd07180c1) | feat | Add build target for jsaction contract binary.

However, I've noticed a significant impact on performance metrics, particularly First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), when using the new version.\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, I found that Angular now splits all JavaScript code into chunks and adds a ```<link rel=\"modulepreload\">``` for each chunk in the <head> of the page. Although the scripts are loaded asynchronously with [@defer](https://angular.io/api/core/defer) method, the preloaded scripts seem to be affecting the rendering of critical content, delaying FCP and LCP.\r\n\r\nI've conducted tests using Lighthouse, and the results show that removing the modulepreload links improves FCP and LCP metrics. This issue seems to be similar to what was reported in these GitHub discussions:\r\n\r\n[GoogleChrome/lighthouse#11960](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/11960#issuecomment-779049941)\r\n[vitejs/vite#5991](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/5991#issuecomment-1088711936)\r\nIn both discussions, users reported improvements in FCP and LCP metrics after disabling or reducing the number of modulepreload links.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a way to selectively disable modulepreload links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 based on specific use cases. Therefore, I would like to seek clarification and guidance on how to address this issue to improve performance.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\nUpgrade an Angular application to version 18.0.0-next.4.\r\nEnable SSR and use esbuild.\r\nAnalyze performance metrics using Lighthouse with and without the modulepreload links.\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nI expect to see improved FCP and LCP metrics when excessive modulepreload links are removed or selectively disabled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nI have attached screenshots of the Lighthouse test results, showing the impact of modulepreload links on performance metrics.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1 - Lighthouse Test with modulepreload links\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132612](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/95b5a3ac-ac96-43a5-90f3-f538f900ec19)\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2 - Lighthouse Test without modulepreload links\r\nPerformed by removing all modulepreload links server side: \r\n```typescript\r\n        html = html.replace(\r\n          /<link .?rel=\"modulepreload\" .*?href=\"(?<href>.+?\\.js)\".*?>/g,\r\n          ''\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132254](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/0719109b-e98c-409b-9028-a72c4add7210)\r\n\r\nYour assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.0-next.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0-next.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... google-maps, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1800.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        17.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular/ssr                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular               18.0.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                              7.8.1\r\ntypescript                        5.4.5\r\nzone.js                           0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Excessive modulepreload Links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 Affecting Performance Metrics\" (#27490)"},{"Id":"2248103917","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-17T11:52:45","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27486","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support native async/await when app is zoneless","State":"open","Body":"\r\nThis commit updates the esbuild based builders to emit native async/await when `zone.js` is not added as a polyfill.\r\n\r\nCloses #22191\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27486","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support native async/await when app is zoneless\" (#27486)"},{"Id":"2248068803","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-17T11:33:06","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27485","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): introduce new official build system package","State":"open","Body":"The `@angular/build` package has been introduced to house the esbuild/Vite-based build system that was newly introduced as stable in v17.

I know its a lot of work but it would be great to have it in the documentation. I would put there some of the most common ways to style a component. For example for mat card how to remove elevation. For buttons how to change colors outside of the primary. We all love material design but we need these things to make our apps feel like our apps. \r\n\r\nIn the styling guide how are we supposed to know what mat.define-dark-theme properties etc. We need more documentation about those. \r\n\r\nI find myself googling these simple things every time i am implementing some of the designs and it is frustrating. I believe you did a good job creating all of these things for styling but it is very hard for us to use them.\r\n\r\nThank you and i hope you take this into consideration.  \r\nThis is related to documentation in general for all components\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#applying-a-theme-to-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28879","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Styling tab to component pages\" (#28879)"},{"Id":"2241469039","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-13T09:54:12","Actor":"Char2sGu","Number":"28878","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/dialog): Support for Leaving Animation - wait for all child animations to complete before disposing the overlay","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, when closing a dialog, the corresponding overlay is immediately disposed (L106):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e3eef47f80a7c1dda4b538128fed7f530f7cdff1/src/cdk/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L99-L113\r\n\r\nAnd when disposing an overlay, the host `<div>` element of the overlay is immediately removed from the DOM (L269):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e3eef47f80a7c1dda4b538128fed7f530f7cdff1/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-ref.ts#L252-L280\r\n\r\nThe current behavior completely eliminated the possibility to implement a `:leave` animation for dialogs, since the ancestor element of the dialog, the overlay, is removed via the native DOM API, and the Angular animation engine cannot hook into this process to perform the `:leave` animation.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I propose to allow the DialogContainer to decide when the overlay should be disposed. By doing so, we can create another DialogContainer aside from CdkDialogContainer, e.g. LeaveAnimationAwareDialogContainer, which performs a leave animation that does nothing but `animateChild()`. The LeaveAnimationAwareDialogContainer notifies the DialogRef to dispose the overlay after the leaving animation is completed.\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28878","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdk/dialog): Support for Leaving Animation - wait for all child animations to complete before disposing the overlay\" (#28878)"},{"Id":"2241389080","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-13T06:58:39","Actor":"slavafomin","Number":"28876","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(slide-toggle): prevent value change","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nHello!

During adding the sort functionality to the tables I've experienced very strange behaviors of MatSort. In some components the setter of MatSort is executed multiple times and in other components just once.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I have to handle the MatSort in components where it's only set once differently as in the components where it's set multiple times.\r\n\r\nI've searched for reasons. But haven't found any. The strange thing is that two of all components are almost the same but in one component the MatSort's setter is executed multiple times and in the other just once. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nI don't know how I can reproduce the bug, because both components I speak about in the description set the table's data-source initially `public dataSource = new MatTableDataSource<Data2>();` and overwrite it after the data is set asynchron` this.dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(this.data);`. In some components the MatSort's setter is exeuted again if this.dataSource has been overwritten. \r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-omvcop?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponent-two%2Fcomponent-two.component.ts\r\n\r\nIn the Stackblitz you can see that I have to assign the matSort's-value to a private property in **component one** where I load the data asynchron. \r\n\r\nIn **component two** the data is loaded synchron and the mat-sort works from the beginning. **Important**: In my application the data in component2 is loadad asynchon too, but has the behavior as if I would load the data synchron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality and behavior has to work for asynchron loaded data equal.  \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality is different between two components that load the data asynchron. In one of them it works and in the other it doesn't\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^15.5.1\r\n- CDK/Material: ^15.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28873","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"MatSort: Setter is executed multiple times in some components and just once in other components\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2240016991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-12T12:09:57","Actor":"lsamboretrorabbit","Number":"28874","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): chip input with autocomplete has both the selected and the suggested values added","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a bug in the Angular Material `chips` component where the autocomplete input has both the selected and the suggested values added.

So no matter what you enter in the input field, you will always get the same result from the server, but the input field does not reflect those results.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe input field is initialized with *****, then a user overwrites the password with 'secret password', the server returns ***** but the form field does not reflect this change. Instead it stillt displays 'secret password'.\r\nIf the result from the server is different than the initialized state, the input is able to pick up the change.\r\n\r\nThe form is a template driven form with one way data-binding for [ngModel]. We use one way data-binding here on purpose to achieve unidirectional data flow.\r\n\r\nPlease also see the simplified example on Stackblitz:\r\n[here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lktucd?file=src/app/app.component.html)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lktucd?file=src/app/app.component.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45173","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NgModel in input field remains unchanged if model is reset to inital state\" (#45173)"},{"Id":"1146718604","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-23T08:05:21","Actor":"sahilbabbar","Number":"45165","RawContent":null,"Title":"`postinstall: ngcc` required or not in Angular 13 Ivy app consuming Ivy library","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n**Observation 1:** After upgrading an Ivy application to v13, `postinstall: ngcc` wasn't removed automatically during update steps.\r\n\r\n**Observation 2:** When a new v13 application is created, `postinstall: ngcc` is not present.\r\n\r\n**Query 1:** Is `postinstall: ngcc` required in v13, if the application as well as the library are at the exact same versions of Angular and the corrosponding dependencies and both are Ivy enabled?\r\n\r\n**Query 2:** On building an Ivy library, the output `package.json` contains a script that blocks `npm publish`.

This made changing the forms abstractions in any way a challenging operation. Additionally, there were several import cycles involving this file and other parts of the forms system.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, `model.ts` is broken out into a number of files. Several strategies were used to effect this refactoring:\r\n\r\n * The interfaces of the main abstractions are interdependent, and are split out into a separate `model/api.ts` file.\r\n * Each interface is implemented by a private implementation class.\r\n * Constructors for each abstraction are defined with a separate constructor signature, and a `const` constructor declaration which is merged with\r\n   the interface type.\r\n * The `_find` operation, which previously depended on `instanceof` checks with the actual constructor types to achieve different behavior for different types of controls, has been refactored to rely on an internal method on the `AbstractControl` hierarchy instead.\r\n\r\nTogether, these changes will make the forms package much more maintainable, and pave the way for type-specific changes needed to strongly type the forms abstractions.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR was originally drafted by @alxhub, but I am shepherding it through review, since it will prepare typed forms for an easier API review.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: alxhub","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45168","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): split apart `model.ts`\" (#45168)"},{"Id":"1147450279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T22:55:36","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"45167","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add ariaCurrentWhenActive input to RouterLinkActive directive","State":"open","Body":"add the ariaCurrentWhenActive input to the RouterLinkActive directive so that\r\nusers can easily set the aria-current property to their active router\r\nlinks\r\n\r\nresolves #35051\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In my case, an unfortunate client requirement is that each environment is in a folder of a CDN endpoint, e.g. `cdnendpoint.com/dev/[files]`.\r\n\r\nThis necessitates changing the baseHref for an application, which can be done at build time or as part of modifying the base tag in index.html. It looks like it can be done programmatically as well; however, my attempts to do that fail to load the built angular files themselves, e.g. main.js, because they are still hard-coded to load from the root of the endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn this case, I'm not certain there *is* a solution (but am happy to hear if I've been doing something wrong, and am submitting in case someone sees a solution where I do not). I suppose the built artifacts need to be referenced in some way from index.html and the base tag is the most reasonable way to do that.\r\n\r\nIt might be that a guide to build once, deploy many

Try to access element by name attribute, such as in tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIf name attribute is directly set, then Angular Material Input needs to set name attribute more carefully.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAngular Material Input overrides name attribute directly set by user of mat-input.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24463","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/input): name property setting overrides developer defined name property\" (#24463)"},{"Id":"1146887211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T13:04:48","Actor":"davidglezz","Number":"24461","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark","State":"open","Body":"It seems that it was accidentally added in the first version of the component. unneeded attribute `xml:space` is removed.\r\n\r\nInfo about `xml:space`: http://www.xmlplease.com/xml/xmlspace/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24461","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark\" (#24461)"},{"Id":"1146085479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T20:49:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24459","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a regression caused by #19505 where clicking directly on the `input` element will prevent the click from reaching custom `click` listeners outside the radio button.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements\" (#24459)"},{"Id":"1146009097","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T16:28:22","Actor":"RobertAKARobin","Number":"24457","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/form-field): Do not detach hints from DOM when in error state","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #24319","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24457","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/form-field): Do not detach hints from DOM when in error state\" (#24457)"},{"Id":"1144984002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T02:20:26","Actor":"devversion","Number":"24455","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix stamping for builds performed in CI","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes the stamping for snapshot builds and the artifact deployment job.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24455","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fix stamping for builds performed in CI\" (#24455)"},{"Id":"1144971615","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T02:20:02","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24454","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/schematics): replace usages of deprecated TypeScript APIs","State":"closed","Body":"Replaces all of our usages of deprecated `ts.create*` and `ts.update*` APIs with their non-deprecated counterparts.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24454","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/schematics): replace usages of deprecated TypeScript APIs\" (#24454)"},{"Id":"1144619613","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-20T19:32:01","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24451","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-experimental/mdc-dialog): align change detection with non-MDC version","State":"closed","Body":"The non-MDC dialog container uses `Default` change detection while the MDC one uses `OnPush` which causes issues for users trying to migrate.

With redirects now configurable, exposing the redirected property provides developers with a way to determine if a response was the result of a redirect, further aligning HttpClient's behavior with the native Fetch API and enhancing observability of request flow\r\n\r\n## The Change Includes:\r\n\r\n- Added `redirected` property to `HttpResponse` and `HttpErrorResponse` classes\r\n- Updated `FetchBackend` to capture and forward the `redirected` flag from the native fetch response\r\n- Maintains consistency with the Fetch API specification\r\n- Added unit tests to ensure the property is correctly captured and exposed\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Motivation / Use Cases\r\n\r\nThe `redirected` property provides valuable information about whether the response was the result of a redirect:\r\n\r\n- **Security**: Detect when requests have been redirected, which is important for security-sensitive applications\r\n- **Analytics**: Track redirect behavior for performance monitoring and debugging\r\n- **Conditional Logic**: Implement different handling based on whether a response was redirected\r\n- **API Compliance**: Maintain consistency with the native Fetch API behavior\r\n \r\n## Examples of New Usage\r\n\r\n### Basic Redirect Detection\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n// Detect if the response was redirected\r\nthis.http.get('/api/data' ,   { observe: 'response' } ).subscribe({\r\n  next: (response) => {\r\n    if (response.redirected) {\r\n      console.log('Response was redirected');\r\n      console.log('Final URL:', response.url);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conditional Logic Based on Redirects\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Handle different scenarios based on redirect status\r\nthis.http.get('/api/user-profile'  ,   { observe: 'response' } ).subscribe({\r\n  next: (response) => {\r\n    if (response.redirected) {\r\n      // User might have been redirected to login page\r\n      this.handlePossibleAuthRedirect(response);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Direct response, process normally\r\n      this.processUserProfile(response.body);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62675","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(http): Add redirected property to HttpResponse and HttpErrorResp…\" (#62675)"},{"Id":"3233852348","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-16T22:05:45","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"62657","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(signal-forms): allow validation logic to return null and false","State":"closed","Body":"Something that's come up a few times during development of this prototype is that it would be nice to allow returning values like `null` and `false` from validation logic functions.

These use compilation mode partial. \nThis work perfectly up until @angular 20.0.x.\nSo the problems i encountered:\n- some elements not renderer well and causing other elements not to be renders\n- issue with viewchild\n- issues with mat buttons in mat dialogs\n\nI could isolate the problem to @angular/compiler and/or @angular/compiler-cli (both versions need to be the same). I did this by gradually updating each package to 21.1.\n\nIf we use compilation mode full in the \\@my-company libraries then it works. But I can't just move to this system as we also have third party libraries which are partially compiled.\n\nWhen I read the documentation there seems to be something new in the compiler regarding 'optimized template compilation'. So my guess the problem is related to this area.\n\nProbably some elements are jitted but something doesnt work out and is being skipped?\n\nIt's a critical problem because we have 50+ applications running with this architecture (externals and cdn-like bundles.

This is a regression from previous behavior when using the legacy `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder.\n\nUsing the old `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder, after the application build, we had a `runtime.js` file where we could find the list of hashes for every chunk in the format `sriHashes = {chunkNumber1: \"sha384-hash1\", ...}`, and there was code that creates a script tag and adds the integrity attribute to it using the `sriHashes` list.\n\nExample of code from `runtime.js`\n```js\nvar f = document.createElement(\"script\");\nf.src = \"chunk.js\";\nf.integrity = sriHashes[chunkId];\nf.crossOrigin = \"anonymous\";\ndocument.head.appendChild(f);\n```\n\nSo the integrity validation worked for loaded chunks.\n\nIn the new `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` builder, there is no list of hashes, and chunks are loaded just using `import(\"./chunk-name.js\")` code.\n\nA simple check by changing chunk code after build confirms it. There is no error from the browser about a wrong integrity value for the changed dynamically loaded chunk.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- create new Angular (e.g. 19.2.15) application\n- add `subresourceIntegrity` flag in angular.json file\n```json\n{\n\"architect\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\n      \"configurations\": {\n        \"production\": {\n          \"subresourceIntegrity\": true,\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- add module with lazy loading\n- add link to open lazy loaded page\n- build application\n  - `ng run build`\n- change code in dynamically loaded chunk in dist folder\n  - e.g. add `console.log('test')` in any appropriate place in chunk code\n- run application from dist folder\n  - e.g. use http-server\n- open application in browser\n- click link to load chunk\n- check if any error in console about invalid integrity\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.15\nNode: 22.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.14\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms, localize\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.15\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.15\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.15\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.15\n@angular/cli                    19.2.15\n@schematics/angular             19.2.15\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30724","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"No subresource integrity validation for dynamically loaded chunks\" (#30724)"},{"Id":"3234051113","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-16T18:48:23","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"30719","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): fix layout of pill button","State":"closed","Body":"In the case of a long project name, the button would wrap.

It only applies updates for global styles (styles.scss). Any changes to component templates (inline or external .html files) or component-scoped styles (inline or external .scss files) result in a full-page reload, and component state is lost (e.g., text in an input field is cleared).\n\nThis issue persists across multiple environments and configurations:\n\nIt is not an SSR issue: The problem occurs in brand-new projects generated with and without SSR (ng new --ssr=false).\n\nIt is not a Node.js version issue: Tested on multiple supported Node.js versions, including 20.16, 20.17, and the latest 22.x LTS.\n\nIt is not a local environment issue: The problem is reproducible on both a native Windows machine and inside a clean Linux environment using VS Code Dev Containers (Docker).\n****\nThe file watcher is working: When using --poll inside Docker, changes are detected, but it still results in a full reload instead of HMR.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nAngular CLI: v20 or later\n\nNode.js: v22 (LTS)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Create a new, clean Angular application without SSR.\n\n`ng new hmr-repro-app --ssr=false\n`\n2. Navigate into the new project directory.\n\n`cd hmr-repro-app\n`\n3. Add a simple input field to the component template to test state preservation. Open \nsrc/app/app.component.html and replace its content with:\n\n```\n<h1>HMR Test</h1>\n<p>Type something in the input below, then change this text.</p>\n<input type=\"text\" />\n```\n\n4. Serve the application.\n\n5. ng serve\n\n6. Open the application in the browser. Type some text into the input field.\n\n7. Now, go back to src/app/app.component.html and change the text in the <p> tag. Save the file.\n\nExpected Result\nThe text paragraph on the page should update instantly via HMR without a full-page reload. The text you typed into the input field should remain because the component's state is preserved.\n\nActual Result\nThe browser performs a full-page reload. The text typed into the input field is cleared, which proves that HMR has failed and the component's state was destroyed and re-created.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.1.0\nNode: 22.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.0\n@schematics/angular          20.1.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis issue does not appear to be specific to any single environment, as it has been reproduced under multiple conditions.\n\n- **Browser:** Tested on the latest version of Google Chrome.\n- **Operating System:** The issue is reproducible on both native Windows and on Linux (when running inside a VS Code Dev Container).\n- **Package Manager:** npm\n- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30714","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HMR works only for Global styles.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.1.0-rc.0...20.1.0)\n\nThere have been some internal mapping changes in Material 2 theme config maps generated by `mat.define-light-theme` and `mat.define-dark-theme`.\n\nIf your app was directly modifying these internal properties to alter styles, such as setting new color values used in the foreground and background palette maps, then your changes may no longer be applied to the components. The supported path for changing theme values is through each component’s overrides API.\n\nThe Material 2 component styles have undergone minor adjustments to enhance consistency across components and better align with the latest Material 2 specification. These changes result in a closer adherence to system-level colors such as `surface`, `background`, `disabled`, and `surface` variants. In general, these changes are slight hue differences for grey colors that aren’t very noticeable.\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

When checking the reason, I found out that the CSS variable is not applied.\n\nI'm using a theme based on the M2 theme, and I'm not very familiar with themes. But maybe a hint what might have changed here could help me to find out the reason.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSince its a payed theme I cannot paste the whole code here but I could try to create a minimal repro if issue isn't obvious. M2 theming is quite customized by the author so there might probably be many reasons.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo breaking change with 20.1 (since none were listed).\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nE.g. all dropdows (menu, select) lost their background color. Guess there might be more if I check for undefined variables.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 20.1.0\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.0\n... animations,

migration since v18","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nIn our project we started using Material 3 theming since Angular 18.\nWe used for that the following mixins mat.define-theme, mat.define-light-theme, or mat.define-dark-theme.\nIn usage like:\n\n```scss\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\n$theme: mat.define-theme((\n  color: (\n    theme-type: dark,\n    primary: mat.$violet-palette,\n  ),\n  typography: (\n    brand-family: 'Comic Sans',\n    bold-weight: 900\n  ),\n  density: (\n    scale: -1\n  )\n));\n```\n\nBut since Angular 19 and now Angular 20, we have in the documentation [Here](https://material.angular.dev/guide/theming) a comment indicating to still have a look to v18 documentation.\n\n`If your application depends on a version before v19, or if your application's theme is applied using a theme config created with mat.define-theme, mat.define-light-theme, or mat.define-dark-theme, then you can refer to the theming guides at [v18.material.angular.dev/guides](https://v18.material.angular.dev/guides).`\n\nRegarding that, several questions/clarifications will help a lot:\n- the \"old way\" used since V18 is going to be deprecated ?\n- we follow all release notes since v18, but didn't see anything explaining how to migrate to the new functions ?\n- Is there a schematic available for that migration ?\n\nThanks for your help\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/guide/theming","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue

a sudden we go to `mdc-` so I update my code and now I see visual issues because some variables and or components moved back to `mat-` again.\n\nCan the Angular team maybe stop doing that because:\na) you guys release new versions very quickly\nb) I want to stay up to date, but I dont have time to visually inspect my whole application when I think it is is a routine update now that m3 has become

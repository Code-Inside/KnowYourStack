While this structure works well for simple applications, most real-world and enterprise Angular projects require a custom architecture from the beginning.\n\nIn practice, developers and teams often need to manually restructure the generated project to follow their preferred architecture, such as separating folders for auth, features, shared, and core. This manual setup process is repetitive, time-consuming, and can lead to inconsistencies across projects and teams.\n\nI would like to propose a feature (or supporting tool) that allows developers to define their Angular project architecture before project generation.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide a simple and interactive way to generate an Angular project with a custom structure instead of the default Angular CLI layout.\n\nThe proposed flow would be:\n\nAsk the developer which Angular version they want to use when creating the project\n\nAsk whether the project should be module-based or standalone (component-based)\n\nAllow the developer to define their own main folder structure\n\nFor example, a developer may want the following top-level folders:\n\ncore\n\nshared\n\nfeatures\n\nlayout\n\nThe developer should be able to fully manage and customize these folders, including creating subfolders inside them based on project needs.\n\nAfter defining the configuration and folder structure, the tool should generate the Angular project automatically. When the developer runs a single command or clicks a generate button, the Angular project should be created according to the selected version, architecture type, and custom folder structure.\n\nThis approach would give developers full flexibility, reduce manual setup work, and help maintain a consistent project architecture from the beginning.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66219","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Custom Angular Project Structure Generation\" (#66219)"},{"Id":"3752731399","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-22T08:03:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"66218","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): stop ThisReceiver inheritance from ImplicitReceiver","State":"open","Body":"Back in #39323, I added a new `ThisReceiver` node to represent accesses done through `this` and I ended up making it inherit from `ImplicitReceiver`.

using the Angular CLI (ng new), the CLI generates a fixed default folder structure. While this structure works well for simple applications, most real-world and enterprise Angular projects require a custom architecture from the beginning.\n\nIn practice, developers and teams often need to manually restructure the generated project to follow their preferred architecture, such as separating folders for auth, features, shared, and core. This manual setup process is repetitive, time-consuming, and can lead to inconsistencies across projects and teams.\n\nI would like to propose a feature (or supporting tool) that allows developers to define their Angular project architecture before project generation.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide a simple and interactive way to generate an Angular project with a custom structure instead of the default Angular CLI layout.\n\nThe proposed flow would be:\n\nAsk the developer which Angular version they want to use when creating the project\n\nAsk whether the project should be module-based or standalone (component-based)\n\nAllow the developer to define their own main folder structure\n\nFor example, a developer may want the following top-level folders:\n\ncore\n\nshared\n\nfeatures\n\nlayout\n\nThe developer should be able to fully manage and customize these folders, including creating subfolders inside them based on project needs.\n\nAfter defining the configuration and folder structure, the tool should generate the Angular project automatically. When the developer runs a single command or clicks a generate button, the Angular project should be created according to the selected version, architecture type, and custom folder structure.\n\nThis approach would give developers full flexibility, reduce manual setup work, and help maintain a consistent project architecture from the beginning.\n\n### Alternatives

IDEs and advanced tooling","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nAngular CLI’s current Vitest integration does not expose a supported programmatic integration surface for external tooling.\n\nFor advanced tooling such as mutation testing (StrykerJS) and IDE integrations, two capabilities are required, both of which are currently blocked:\n\n1. The ability to override or extend the Vitest configuration at runtime.  \n   This is needed to run Vitest in a mutation-testing mode, for example to change includes/excludes, disable threading, adjust environments, add setup files, or tweak dependency handling.\n\n2. Access to the Vitest instance itself, so external tools can use Vitest APIs such as the `provide` API for mutant switching (injecting or replacing values during test execution).  \n   Vitest `provide` API documentation: https://main.vitest.dev/api/advanced/vitest.html#provide\n\nAt the moment, Angular CLI fully encapsulates Vitest creation and configuration. As a result, external tools cannot integrate without re-implementing Angular CLI internals.\n\nThis issue is not limited to StrykerJS. Other tools in the ecosystem are running into the same limitation:\n\n- The Vitest VS Code extension cannot detect or execute tests in Angular projects using the CLI Vitest setup:  \n  https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/686\n- IDE and external tooling compatibility issues around Vitest are already being tracked by the Angular CLI team:  \n  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31734\n\nWe’d also like to thank the Angular team for the long-standing collaboration with the tooling ecosystem, and with StrykerJS in particular. Changes in Angular CLI over the years made it possible for tools like StrykerJS to support Angular with Karma reliably for a long time, and we really appreciate that effort. We hope we can work something out together again so the new Vitest-based architecture remains just as extensible and ecosystem-friendly.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe would like Angular CLI to expose a stable, supported API for its Vitest integration that external tools can build upon.\n\nConcretely, this would include:\n\n1. Runtime Vitest config overrides before instance creation  \n   External tooling should be able to provide or merge Vitest configuration before the Vitest instance is created. This is required for use cases like mutation testing, where tools need to adjust runner-level behavior such as threading, test selection, setup files, or environment options.\n\n2. Access to the actual Vitest instance  \n   External tools need access to the real Vitest instance so they can:\n   - Use the Vitest `provide` API for mutant switching and other runtime injections\n   - Control test execution (for example related tests, name pattern filtering, or repeated runs)\n   - Reset or manage internal state between runs in a supported way\n\n3. An exported helper function, for example `buildAndCreateVitest(...)`\n\n   This helper would:\n   - Perform the Angular build\n   - Load the compiled files into memory\n   - Create and return the configured Vitest instance\n\n   It should also:\n   - Allow pre-create Vitest config overrides\n   - Work when invoked from an external tool’s execution context (such as a sandbox directory with modified or mutated files)\n   - Return the underlying, mutable Vitest instance, not just a “run tests” abstraction\n\n   Tools like StrykerJS could then call this function from their Vitest test runner instead of duplicating Angular CLI internals or relying on fragile workarounds.\n\nProviding this kind of integration point would significantly improve compatibility with IDE plugins, mutation testing tools, and other advanced testing or analysis tooling, while keeping Angular CLI as the single source of truth for how Vitest is configured and executed in Angular projects.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n- Using Analog’s Vitest integration, which exposes a more standard and tool-friendly Vitest setup:  \n  https://analogjs.org/docs/features/testing/vitest\n\n  While this can work as a workaround, it is not a good long-term solution for Angular CLI users. It requires manual configuration by the user, is not officially supported by Angular CLI, and does not provide an out-of-the-box Angular experience. As a result, tooling would only work for users who opt into a specific non-CLI setup, rather than working by default for Angular projects.\n\n- Custom scripts that build Angular separately and invoke Vitest outside Angular CLI.  \n  These approaches are brittle, bypass CLI guarantees, duplicate Angular internals, and are difficult to maintain over time.\n\nUltimately, both alternatives shift complexity to end users or tooling authors and fragment the ecosystem. A supported integration point in Angular CLI would allow tools to work out of the box for Angular projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32182","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vitest integration lacks programmatic API for IDEs and advanced tooling\" (#32182)"},{"Id":"3747863805","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T15:33:49","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32181","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: remove control characters from puppeteer serve output in E2E tests","State":"closed","Body":"Ensures that ANSI color codes do not interfere with URL matching in the Puppeteer E2E utility by using 'NO_COLOR' and removing control characters from the stdout.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32181","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: remove control characters from puppeteer serve output in E2E tests\" (#32181)"},{"Id":"3746790893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T13:56:24","Actor":"mikem-of","Number":"32176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inconsistent default templates in App component for inline template vs external template file","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen generating a new project, an App component is created with inconsistent templates, depending on whether you use internal or external templates.\n\nWhen you use `ng new -t` (inline template), the default `h1` contains `Welcome to {{ title() }}!`:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/standalone-files/src/app/app__suffix__.ts.template#L8\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/module-files/src/app/app__suffix__.ts.template#L6\n\nWhen you use `ng new` (external template file), the default `h1` contains  `Hello, {{ title() }}`:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/aef7d65438306911b59d3cb16c74a2bd0567bd77/packages/schematics/angular/application/files/common-files/src/app/app__suffix__.html.template#L233\n\n\nWhen I add Cypress using `ng e2e`, it will create this default assertion: `cy.contains('app is running') `.

Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.\n\n  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.\n\n  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10265](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).\n\n- Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.\n\n  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:\n\n  ```yaml\n  allowBuilds:\n    esbuild: true\n    core-js: false\n  ```\n\n  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - esbuild\n  ignoredBuiltDependencies:\n    - core-js\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10311](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)\n\n- Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#&#8203;10301](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#&#8203;8658](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).\n- Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#&#8203;10294](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).\n- Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#&#8203;10273](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).\n- When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#&#8203;10197](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).\n\n##### Platinum

Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.25.0...v10.26.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Block git-hosted dependencies from running prepare scripts unless explicitly allowed in `onlyBuiltDependencies` [#&#8203;10288](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10288).\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Compute integrity hash for HTTP tarball dependencies when fetching, storing it in the lockfile to prevent servers from serving altered content on subsequent installs [#&#8203;10287](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10287).\n\n- Added a new setting `blockExoticSubdeps` that prevents the resolution of exotic protocols in transitive dependencies.\n\n  When set to `true`, direct dependencies (those listed in your root `package.json`) may still use exotic sources, but all transitive dependencies must be resolved from a trusted source. Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.\n\n  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.\n\n  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10265](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).\n\n- Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.\n\n  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:\n\n  ```yaml\n  allowBuilds:\n    esbuild: true\n    core-js: false\n  ```\n\n  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - esbuild\n  ignoredBuiltDependencies:\n    - core-js\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10311](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)\n\n- Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#&#8203;10301](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#&#8203;8658](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).\n- Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#&#8203;10294](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).\n- Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#&#8203;10273](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).\n- When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#&#8203;10197](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.25.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.25.0): pnpm 10.25\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.24.0...v10.25.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Allow loading certificates from `cert`, `ca`, and `key` for specific registry URLs. E.g., `//registry.example.com/:ca=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...`. Previously this was only working via `certfile`, `cafile`, and `keyfile`.\n\n  These properties are supported in `.npmrc`, but were ignored by pnpm, this will make pnpm read and use them as well.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10230](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10230).\n\n- Added a new flag called `--bare` to `pnpm init` for creating a package.json with the bare minimum of required fields [#&#8203;10226](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10226).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Improved reporting of ignored dependency scripts [#&#8203;10276](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10276).\n- `pnpm install` should build any dependencies that were added to `onlyBuiltDependencies` and were not built yet [#&#8203;10256](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10256).\n- `pnpm publish -r --force` should allow to run publish over already existing versions in the registry [#&#8203;10272](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10272).\n- Don't fail with a `ERR_PNPM_MISSING_TIME` error if a package that is excluded from trust policy checks is missing the time field in the metadata.\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

When the player is already playing (from autoplay), it now correctly uses `seekTo()` to jump to the specified `startSeconds`.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Updated `src/youtube-player/youtube-player.ts` to check for autoplay in playerVars\r\n- Added test case in `src/youtube-player/youtube-player.spec.ts` to validate the fix\r\n- Updated code comment to clarify the autoplay scenario\r\n\r\n##

Breaking Changes (affecting only experimental features)\n\n##### forms\n\n- The shape of `SignalFormsConfig.classes` has changed\n\n  Previously each function in the `classes` map took a `FieldState`. Now\n  it takes a `Field` directive.\n\n  For example if you previously had:\n\n  ```\n  provideSignalFormsConfig({\n    classes: {\n      'my-valid': (state) => state.valid()\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  You would need to update to:\n\n  ```\n  provideSignalFormsConfig({\n    classes: {\n      'my-valid': ({state}) => state().valid()\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  (cherry picked from commit [`348f149`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/348f149e8b06d6885f54bac4cf03a9481a8b19b7))\n- (cherry picked from commit [`ae0c590`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ae0c59028a2f393ea5716bf222db2c38e7a3989f))\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [4c8fb3631d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/4c8fb3631d58e22d693aba0b89243f2e9ecb0807) | fix  | throw better errors for potential circular references  |\n| [48492524ea](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/48492524ea4adfa232b0daee0d955924be31ebea) | fix  | use mutable ResponseInit type for RESPONSE\\_INIT token |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [81772b420d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/81772b420dcda2cbe2a8cb75e50c6da2e1ecdc68) | feat     | pass field directive to class config                          |\n| [729b96476b](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/729b96476b73f1670a0f7c6ab3f36be9d38ebcac) | refactor | rename field to fieldTree in FieldContext and ValidationError |\n\n##### language-service\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [e0694df3ec](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e0694df3eccae3d31a4ea537dffe1db1368ef34a) | fix  | avoid interpolation highlighting inside [@&#8203;let](https://redirect.github.com/let) |\n| [5047be4bc1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/5047be4bc1c6f6016263703c743f8033f669f0ee) | fix  | Prevent language service from crashing on suggestion diagnostic errors |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.\n\n  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.\n\n  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10265](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).\n\n- Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.\n\n  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:\n\n  ```yaml\n  allowBuilds:\n    esbuild: true\n    core-js: false\n  ```\n\n  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - esbuild\n  ignoredBuiltDependencies:\n    - core-js\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10311](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)\n\n- Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#&#8203;10301](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#&#8203;8658](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).\n- Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#&#8203;10294](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).\n- Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#&#8203;10273](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).\n- When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#&#8203;10197](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

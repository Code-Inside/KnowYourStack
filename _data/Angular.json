Bound listener callbacks as well as creating, inserting, or attaching a view should also schedule change detection. This will be the case for zoneless applications but should also apply to zone-based applications when these actions happen outside the Angular zone. It is a confusing implementation detail that these APIs do not schedule change detection even though they specifically indicate that change detection should run.\r\n\r\nThis would address a lot of confusion, including but almost certainly not limited to my quick search finding the following issues:\r\n\r\n#53841\r\n#52610\r\n#53566\r\n#52940\r\n#51970\r\n#50702\r\n#50259\r\n#50266\r\n#50160\r\n#49940\r\n#48890\r\n#45105\r\n#42241\r\n#41553\r\n#37223\r\n#31695\r\n#24728 along with the ones linked from there: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15770, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15946, #18254, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19731, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20112, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22472, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23697, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24727 (navigations create views so it should always schedule change detection, even if triggered outside the zone)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, there's plenty of code around that is forced to try dealing with zones when it really shouldn't be necessary because one of the above APIs are used.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51971 (defer blocks attach views so they should schedule change detection without the listeners needing to run inside the zone)\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/1fe1f69303780c11c07ff84313f5fdc10440d55b/src/material/snack-bar/snack-bar-container.ts#L203-L210 (`markForCheck` is called so you should not also have to use `ngZone.run` to ensure change detection is scheduled)\r\n\r\nThere is certainly a question of whether this would make things more unpredictable. For example, would this cause components created outside the zone to act even more unpredictably where some things cause change detection and others don't (because they were created outside the zone).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"signal updates and `markForCheck` should always schedule change detection\" (#53844)"},{"Id":"2071428913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T00:23:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"53843","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): TestBed should still use the microtask queue to schedule effects","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this commit, `TestBed` would require tests call `flushEffects` or `fixture.detectChanges` in order to execute effects.

I want any values coming out of the Observable to be set on a Signal. So this is how I set it up:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// any used here since the type doesn't really matter in this example\r\nreadonly position = signal<any>(undefined);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npositionStrategy.positionChanges\r\n      .pipe(tap(console.log))\r\n      .subscribe((x) => this.position.set(x));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI display a value in the template derived from this signal, for example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>Position: {{position() | json}}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the Observable (`positionChanges`) emits a value, I see the value output to `console.log`, but in the template, nothing is rendered for `position()`. I would expect since the `position()` signal is referenced in the template, that whenever the value is changed, the template would re-render. I also tried referencing the value in a `computed`, but it still doesn't update.\r\n\r\nI did finally find one way to get it to update. Put the following code into the `constructor`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\neffect(() => this.position());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it renders to the view as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPosition: { \"connectionPair\": { \"originX\": \"center\", \"overlayX\": \"center\", \"originY\": \"top\", \"overlayY\": \"bottom\" }, \"scrollableViewProperties\": { \"isOriginClipped\": false, \"isOriginOutsideView\": false, \"isOverlayClipped\": false, \"isOverlayOutsideView\": false } }\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hwrgyh?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.9\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.9\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.9\r\nng-packagr                      17.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53841","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Change detection not triggered when Signal.set() called from Observable subscription\" (#53841)"},{"Id":"2071277787","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-08T21:48:31","Actor":"alejandrocuba","Number":"53842","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add alejandrocuba to GDE resources","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Expression location: TabNavBarBasicExample component.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/udrwuw?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftab-nav-bar-basic-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open developer console in browser\r\n2. Click around on the Nav Items\r\n3. Observe error in developer console\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo error. I suggest simply making tabPanel optional like stated in Documentation, but of course would be nice to have a good solution to use mat-tab-nav-bar in a wrapper component\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16+\r\n- CDK/Material: 16+ aka MDC \r\n- Browser(s): any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28379","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Tabs): ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError when providing MatTabNavPanel to tabPanel input of mat-tab-nav-bar\" (#28379)"},{"Id":"2067636442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T16:20:24","Actor":"vitale232","Number":"28378","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAutocomplete): When setting `MatAutocomplete.requireSelection = true`  and using the `MatAutocomplete.displayWith` input parameter, the `MatInput`'s `FormControl.valueChanges` observable does not emit values on text input, only on value selection","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the `MatAutcomplete` with the input property `requireSelection` set to `true`, everything works as expected for the simple case (filtering an array of strings).\r\n\r\nWhen setting `requireSelection` to `true` while _also_ using the `MatAtocomplete.dispalyWith` input property, the `FormControl.valueChanges` observable on the `MatInput` instance only fires when an element is selected from the list.

Focus on the input in the example.\r\n2. Start typing. You'll notice that the list does not filter, and the `pre` element below the input still has a value of null\r\n3. Select a value from the list with the keyboard or the mouse. You'll see that the `valueChanges` trigger, and the `pre` element contains our \"complex object\"\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect typing in the input would trigger `valueChanges` with the text that's been input, similar to how it works when the `requireSelection` property is set to false. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would expect that entering a value that is not present in the list would result in no changes to the selected value, as documented by the `requireSelection` documentation, even when it's used in conjunction with `displayWith`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen using `displayWith` in conjunction with `requireSelection`, the input `valueChanges` are only triggered by selecting a value from the list manually. Typing changes into the input _does not_ fire the observable. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatAutocomplete): When setting `MatAutocomplete.requireSelection = true`  and using the `MatAutocomplete.displayWith` input parameter, the `MatInput`'s `FormControl.valueChanges` observable does not emit values on text input, only on value selection\" (#28378)"},{"Id":"2067437291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T14:31:40","Actor":"maxime1992","Number":"28377","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe code I've got:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    importProvidersFrom(MatDialogModule),\r\n    {\r\n      provide:APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi:true,\r\n      useFactory: (dialog:MatDialog) => {\r\n        dialog.open(DialogComponent, {\r\n          data: {\r\n            helloWorld: true,\r\n          },\r\n        });\r\n        return () => true\r\n      },\r\n      deps:[MatDialog]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my dialog component looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./dialog.component.css'],\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule],\r\n})\r\nexport class DialogComponent {\r\n  @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public dialogData: any;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log({ dialogData: this.dialogData }); // this is always `undefined`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hbwckt?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nThen look at the console or the view where I've put a `| json` to debug.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBeing able to access the data passed to a dialog.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nData is always undefined.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `17.0.8`\r\n- CDK/Material: `17.0.4`\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined\" (#28377)"},{"Id":"2067068880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T10:06:24","Actor":"webmichelle","Number":"28376","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-progress-spinner): stroke-width of svg circle not calculated properly for some diameter + strokeWidth values","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe `circle` element of the `mat-progress-spinner`'s SVG does not fill up to the whole space of it's container.

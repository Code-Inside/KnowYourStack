For now, it it sufficient to pass the tests generated by the `ng new` application and we will continue to expand on this design going forward.\r\n\r\nEnable the Jest runner by updating the `test` builder in your `angular.json` to be:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"my-app\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        // ...\r\n        \"test\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:jest\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current approach is to pre-build application tests with the `browser-esbuild` Angular builder under the hood, and then run Jest on the JavaScript outputs.

Many developers create tools to manage multiple Node.js versions in the same development environment. This approach allows them to use older Node.js versions for maintaining old projects and newer versions for developing new projects. In short, with a Node.js version manager, developers can use any version of Node.js.\r\n\r\nI developed a Node.js version manager for my team that has supported us for 8 years.\r\n\r\nFor 8 years, we have been using Angular as the core framework for Electron rendering processes. Due to my conservative personality, outdated system deployment environments, and the need for V8-bytecode processing for Electron main process code, we have only used Angular versions 12.2.x and older.\r\n\r\nTonight, I started a new project in Windows 10 using my Node.js version manager. After creating a directory, I installed Angular CLI version 15.2.6 using the command `npm i -D @angular/cli`. However, when I tried to create an Angular project using the `npm run ng new ...` command in the same directory, I received an error: `The system cannot find the path specified`. To create a new project using the `ng` command, I had to run the following command:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnode ./node_modules/.bin/../@angular/cli/bin/ng.js new project-name --commit=false --defaults=true --inline-style=true --package-manager=npm --routing=true --skip-git=true --skip-install=true --strict=true --style=less --view-encapsulation=Emulated --create-application=false --new-project-root=./\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo execute the ng command in the newly created project (project-name), I had to modify all scripts related to the `ng` command, like this:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"ng\": \"node ./node_modules/.bin/../@angular/cli/bin/ng.js\",\r\n  \"start\": \"npm run ng serve\",\r\n  \"build\": \"npm run ng build\",\r\n  \"watch\": \"npm run ng build --watch --configuration development\",\r\n  \"test\": \"npm run ng test\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter modifying these scripts, other commands can be executed like this:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm run ng g -- application main --inline-style=true --prefix=chenhuiran --routing=true --skip-install=true --strict=true --style=less --view-encapsulation=Emulated\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an important part of the integrated development environment, Angular CLI plays a core role in project development. It would be great if it could be backward compatible during upgrades. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, this is just a complaint. I understand that you're busy, so I won't disturb you any further.\r\n\r\nI hope the above content can be useful to some people.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25049","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Execute ng command with node\" (#25049)"},{"Id":"1679014273","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-24T07:45:13","Actor":"erickbrenesLT","Number":"25047","RawContent":null,"Title":"Global SCSS Mixin-s And Var-s Not Accessible In Components","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am thinking this is a Webpack or angular.json thing possibly.  Found a lot of questions on this without a true answer.  Besides to @import the mixin directly in the component and the used @import variables in the mixin file, which just seems silly to me and not ideal.  I get that components are encapsulated, but you can access global styles... why not scss mixins? So, how do you get global mixins and access them in a component - without importing them directly into the component's scss file?\r\n\r\nI created a _mixins.scss file under the theme folder. Also, in the folder I imported the mixin file in the custom.scss file. Then in the main styles.scss the custom.scss gets imported. Then inside of an angular component I use the @include to pull in the mixin, but get an error. I also have in the angular.json file the styles file marked there so it should be globally available.\r\n\r\nI've also tried switching to @use and @import the mixin directly into the styles.scss = no dice.\r\n\r\nMy Stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76068047/why-is-my-custom-angular-scss-import-failing\r\nSimilar stackoverflow question with link to example: [Angular not importing mixin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70694893/angular-not-importing-mixin)\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js):\r\nSassError: Undefined mixin.\r\n  ╷\r\n7 │     @include card-hover-effect();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMixin code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin card-hover-effect() {\r\n  transition: all 0.3s;\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n    transform: scale(1.02);\r\n    box-shadow: $card-box-shadow;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nVd13.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UoYhK.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFUbE.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PWiNM.png)\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.

import error with `export {} from` ([#&#8203;3070](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3070))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild incorrectly identified statements of the form `export { default as x } from \"y\" assert { type: \"json\" }` as a non-default import. The bug did not affect code of the form `import { default as x } from ...` (only code that used the `export` keyword).\n\n-   Fix a crash with an invalid subpath import ([#&#8203;3067](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3067))\n\n    Previously esbuild could crash when attempting to generate a friendly error message for an invalid [subpath import](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) (i.e. an import starting with `#`). This happened because esbuild originally only supported the `exports` field and the code for that error message was not updated when esbuild later added support for the `imports` field. This crash has been fixed.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.39.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.39.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.38.0...v8.39.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`3f7af9f`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/3f7af9f408625dbc486af914706d34c4b483b5ba) feat: Implement `SourceCode#markVariableAsUsed()` ([#&#8203;17086](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17086)) (Nicholas C.

Read the [announcement blog post here](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4-3)\n\n[![Vite 4.3, It's Fast](https://vitejs.dev/og-image-announcing-vite4-3.png)](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4-3)\n\nIn this minor, we focused on improving the dev server performance. The resolve logic got streamlined, improving hot paths and implementing smarter caching for finding `package.json`, TS config files, and resolved URL in general.\n\nYou can read a detailed walkthrough of the performance work done in this blog post by one of Vite Contributors: [How we made Vite 4.3 faaaaster 🚀](https://sun0day.github.io/blog/vite/why-vite4\\_3-is-faster.html).\n\nThis sprint resulted in speed improvements across the board compared to Vite 4.2.\n\nThese are the performance improvements as measured by [sapphi-red/performance-compare](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red/performance-compare), which tests an app with 1000 React Components cold and warm dev server startup time as well as HMR times for a root and a leaf component:\n\n| **Vite (babel)**   |  Vite 4.2 | Vite 4.3 | Improvement  |\n| :----------------- | --------: | -------: | -----------: |\n| **dev cold start** | 17249.0ms | 5132.4ms |

If my Google Maps domain is not added to the allowed list, Google Maps does not load (which is expected), but when the \"google-map\" component is being destroyed, it throws an exception, causing my app to display a blank page due to the \"google-map\" error:\r\nUncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'remove')\r\n```\r\nclass MapEventManager {\r\n    constructor(_ngZone) {\r\n        this._ngZone = _ngZone;\r\n        /** Pending listeners that were added before the target was set. */\r\n        this._pending = [];\r\n        this._listeners = [];\r\n        this._targetStream = new BehaviorSubject(undefined);\r\n    }\r\n    /** Clears all currently-registered event listeners. */\r\n    _clearListeners() {\r\n        for (const listener of this._listeners) {\r\n            listener.remove(); //<----- NPE Error throwed from here because listener is undefined\r\n        }\r\n        this._listeners = [];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nA null-check should be added for the `listener.remove()` method call to avoid this error.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

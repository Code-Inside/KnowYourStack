Global flag for enabling selection is set (for example `allowSelecting`)\n2. Record specific flag for enabling selection, for example to model user specific rights, is set (for example `row.isSelectable`)\n3. Record is not currently inline edited (for example `row.isEditing`)\n4. (enough for this example)\n\nNow we have the logic if a record is selectable: `if (this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing)`. But now we have to use this logic is multiple places, for example:\n\n1. Enable/disable checkbox for selection (if you want to use checkboxes) (in template)\n2. Apply CSS class through `[ngClass]` (in template)\n3. Check if row is selectable when selection is injected using `ControlValueAccessor.writeValue` (in code)\n\nYou dont want to use a central function because using this function in the template adds a change detection overhead. This leads to code/logic duplication which is hard to maintain if you are not already familiar with the code, for example when another dev wants to add the condition that the row is not selectable when it's currently dragged around.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think about an `@Inline()` decorator. Just like in c/c++ this would not be a command but rather a request to inline. When inlined the code of the function is copied inline into the template, for example:\n```\n@Inline() public isSelectable(row) {\n    return this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing;\n}\n\n<tr\n   [ngClass]=\"{'selectable-row': this.isSelectable(row)}\">\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\nturns into (during compliation):\n```\n<tr\n   [ngClass]=\"{'selectable-row': this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing}\">\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\nSince it's only a request to inline there are scenarios when it's not usefull/possible:\n\n1. When function body contains function calls itself (does not remove overhead)\nException: inner calls are also inline (nested inlining)\n2. When function is overridden\n3. When code is defined thats not valid in the template, for example accessing enum values (maybe still inline but show error)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe explained problem can also be solved by using a pure pipe but using it in the code feels and looks kind of sloppy.\n\n```\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'isSelectable',\n  pure: true\n})\nexport class IsSelecablePipe implements PipeTransform {\n  transform(row, allowSelecting): string[] {\n    return this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing;\n  }\n}\n\nif (new IsSelectablePipe().transform(row, allowSelecting)) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIt's still possible so inline functions would be a convenience feature.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59891","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inline functions for central logic without change detection overhead\" (#59891)"},{"Id":"2839638500","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T07:09:49","Actor":"hannah23280","Number":"59892","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make @injectable optional for components that are already added to providers","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n@angular/core\n\n### Description\n\nAngular v19 - using standalone\n\nCurrently I develop a service called AuthService and added it to the global provider (yes, i don't intend to use @Inject({providedin:'root'}, but don't need to know why, as this is not the crux).\nHowever I notice that if the AuthService  has a constructor that need to be injected with something (e.g HttpClient instance), I still need to apply @Injectable().   \n\n```\n@Injectable() <==this annotation has to be added in order for the DI to work on its constructor.\nexport class AuthService {\n    private readonly http ;\n\n    constructor(hc:HttpClient  ){\n       this.http = hc;\n    }\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nif a custom service has already been added to the provider, its constructor should be implicitly be able to be injected with another service via its constructor by default, rather than force developer to apply @Injectable() .

This does not currently happen, and because of this, Zed editor, which uses a language server for the entire file, cannot go the definition from a reference outside the \"Angular-specific code\".\n\n---\n\nWe are developing an Angular extension for the Zed editor. Zed supports language servers and LSP. As I work, I compare the work of the extension on Zed and VS Code.\n\nCurrently, the Angular VS Code extension passes the `textDocument/references` commands from the entire `.ts` file to ALS, and ALS responds to them correctly, taking into account that symbol can also be used in the template. The handler of this method does not have the `angularOnly` condition, unlike the others:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/951155eb4c2cf5a3d13aa9b290f4eac094c52cef/packages/language-service/src/ts_plugin.ts#L110-L115\nPerhaps because TS is used there unconditionally.\n\nThe situation is different with the `textDocument/definition` command: the Angular extension passes the command to ALS only under certain conditions. It seems to be decided [here](https://github.com/atscott/vscode-ng-language-service/blob/b53eba9c1a1f0d6f5886feba45ea396a66ac61b9/client/src/client.ts#L81-L88). ALS also has the `angularOnly` condition, which prevents the command from being passed to TSLS. https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/951155eb4c2cf5a3d13aa9b290f4eac094c52cef/packages/language-service/src/ts_plugin.ts#L92-L100\n\nThe catch is that in Zed the selected language server works on the entire file, and all commands are passed to it unconditionally. Including the `textDocument/definition` command. If you request a definition in a TS file outside the \"Angular-specific code\", ALS cannot handle this command because `angularOnly: true` is set and passes `null`, although it could pass the command to TSLS and return the correct answer (https://github.com/nathansbradshaw/zed-angular/issues/19#issuecomment-2630409893).\n\nI understand that the `angularOnly` condition in the handlers did not just appear out of nowhere. But for what reason was this condition bypassed in the `textDocument/references` handler? Isn't this reason also suitable for getting rid of the `angularOnly` condition for the `textDocument/definition` command? I don't think this will harm ALS in any way. But if you make it possible to pass the command to TSLS, Zed will be able to receive the correct definition and the feature will work as expected.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI can propose a simple and stupid solution there. Just update function `getDefinitionAndBoundSpan` so that it falls back to TSLS if ALS returns `null`.\n```ts\n  function getDefinitionAndBoundSpan(\n    fileName: string,\n    position: number,\n  ): ts.DefinitionInfoAndBoundSpan | undefined {\n    if (!isTypeScriptFile(fileName)) {\n      return ngLS.getDefinitionAndBoundSpan(fileName, position);\n    } else {\n      return (\n        ngLS.getDefinitionAndBoundSpan(fileName, position) ??\n        tsLS.getDefinitionAndBoundSpan(fileName, position)\n      );\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAt least it works. Although, from what I understand, `tsLS` probably shouldn't be used at all if `angularOnly` is `true`. However, I can go deeper and provide a more valid solution if I'm sure my request is valid.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nTo tell the truth, the feature in Zed is crooked, but it works: since the definition request always returns `null`, Zed thinks that any symbol is a definition and immediately requests and displays references, among which there is also a definition, but you have to search it in the list.\n\nIt is also possible to replace the `angularOnly` parameter in the downloaded package with `false`, but in this case, when you hover over the symbols, two hints are displayed simultaneously: from TSLS and ALS. In addition, making changes to the package is not the best practice.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59888","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Pass `textDocument/definition` requests to TSLS if ALS found nothing\" (#59888)"},{"Id":"2836834038","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-07T16:25:56","Actor":"ShacharHarshuv","Number":"59874","RawContent":null,"Title":"`signal`s creation are significantly slower than `BehaviorSubject`s","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n(Apologies if this is not the right place for it, please direct me to the right place if not)\n\nI noticed while refactoring some app code that create of `signal` is significantly slower than a creation of `BehaviorSubject`. \nHere is a quick. I tested it this way:\n\n```ts\nconst time = performance.now();\nconst arr = Array.from({ length: 6e6 }, (i) => signal(i));\nconsole.log(performance.now() - time);\n```\n(replacing `signal` with `new BehaviorSubject` for the other part of the test)\n\nIt turns out that the `signal` creation was 2.3-3.5 times slower than the `BehaviorSubject` creation. \n\nI was wondering why that is, if it's a known limitation of signals, or if it's an unexpected performance issue?\n\nI would ideally want to refactor all state-describing observables to signals, and I was under the impression that such refactor should be safe, so I was surprised to see this gap in performance. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ca2yyjz5?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.7\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.7\n@angular/build               19.0.7\n@angular/cli                 19.0.7\n@schematics/angular          19.0.7\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59874","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`signal`s creation are significantly slower than `BehaviorSubject`s\" (#59874)"},{"Id":"2838512156","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-07T15:59:22","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"59887","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): use RefactorStreamItem type in rxResource","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

`ActivatedRoute` and `Router` observable class properties","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nrouter\n\n### Description\n\nIt would be nice if there were signal equivalents to things like `data`/`paramMap`/`queryParams`/`routerEvents` etc. on the `ActivatedRoute` and `Router`.\n\nCurrently I have to do a lot of this kinda thing:\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nparams = toSignal(this.activatedRoute.paramMap)\nqueryParams = toSignal(this.activatedRouter.queryParamMap)\nuserId = computed(() => this.params()?.get('userId'))\nviewingTab = computed(() => this.queryParams()?.get('tab'))\n```\n\nOr even sometimes something like this (say if I want to read the params of a child route):\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nrouter = inject(Router)\nrouterEvents = toSignal(this.router.events)\nuserId = linkedSignal({\n  source: () => this.routerEvents(),\n  computation: () => this.activatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.paramMap.get('userId')\n})\n```\n\nWhich can get quite annoying and boilerplatey, and I end up with a lot more things being defined that I really want.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBe able to access a signal based values of these. I don't have a strong opinion on the naming of such things I'm just prefixing things with `signal` to illustrate the idea.\n\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nuserId = computed(() => this.activatedRoute.signalParamMap()?.get('userId'))\nviewingTab = computed(() => this.activatedRoute.signalQueryParamMap()?.get('tab'))\n```\n\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);\nrouter = inject(Router)\nuserId = linkedSignal({\n  source: () => this.router.signalEvents(),\n  computation: () => this.activatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.paramMap.get('userId')\n})\n```\n\nThis assumes that the signal and observable properties would live next to each other in the existing class.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nHave different injectables eg. `SignalActivatedRoute`/`SignalRouter` or maybe even better would be something like `import {ActivatedRoute, Router} from '@angular/router/signals'` so that then you just need to change your return type.\n\nJust to note that I'm only suggesting these things because they are the ones that I use the most often might be more router related things that could benefit from this that I'm not aware of.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59877","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose signal version of `ActivatedRoute` and `Router` observable class properties\" (#59877)"},{"Id":"2836909876","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-07T00:13:22","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"59876","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): introduce experimental `httpResource`","State":"open","Body":"`httpResource` is a new frontend to the `HttpClient` infrastructure.

:house: Internal\n\n-   `babel-preset-env`\n    -   [#&#8203;17097](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/pull/17097) Update dependency babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3 to ^0.11.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.25.0`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0250)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.24.2...v0.25.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.24.0` or `~0.24.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Restrict access to esbuild's development server ([GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99))\n\n    This change addresses esbuild's first security vulnerability report. Previously esbuild set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*` to allow esbuild's development server to be flexible in how it's used for development. However, this allows the websites you visit to make HTTP requests to esbuild's local development server, which gives read-only access to your source code if the website were to fetch your source code's specific URL. You can read more information in [the report](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99).\n\n    Starting with this release, [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) will now be disabled, and requests will now be denied if the host does not match the one provided to `--serve=`. The default host is `0.0.0.0`, which refers to all of the IP addresses that represent the local machine (e.g. both `127.0.0.1` and `192.168.0.1`). If you want to customize anything about esbuild's development server, you can [put a proxy in front of esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#serve-proxy) and modify the incoming and/or outgoing requests.\n\n    In addition, the `serve()` API call has been changed to return an array of `hosts` instead of a single `host` string. This makes it possible to determine all of the hosts that esbuild's development server will accept.\n\n    Thanks to [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://redirect.github.com/sapphi-red) for reporting this issue.\n\n-   Delete output files when a build fails in watch mode ([#&#8203;3643](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3643))\n\n    It has been requested for esbuild to delete files when a build fails in watch mode. Previously esbuild left the old files in place, which could cause people to not immediately realize that the most recent build failed. With this release, esbuild will now delete all output files if a rebuild fails. Fixing the build error and triggering another rebuild will restore all output files again.\n\n-   Fix correctness issues with the CSS nesting transform ([#&#8203;3620](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3620), [#&#8203;3877](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3877), [#&#8203;3933](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3933), [#&#8203;3997](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3997), [#&#8203;4005](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4005), [#&#8203;4037](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4037), [#&#8203;4038](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4038))\n\n    This release fixes the following problems:\n\n    -   Naive expansion of CSS nesting can result in an exponential blow-up of generated CSS if each nesting level has multiple selectors. Previously esbuild sometimes collapsed individual nesting levels using `:is()` to limit expansion. However, this collapsing wasn't correct in some cases, so it has been removed to fix correctness issues.\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        .parent {\n          > .a,\n          > .b1 > .b2 {\n            color: red;\n          }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        .parent > :is(.a, .b1 > .b2) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        .parent > .a,\n        .parent > .b1 > .b2 {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Thanks to [@&#8203;tim-we](https://redirect.github.com/tim-we) for working on a fix.\n\n    -   The `&` CSS nesting selector can be repeated multiple times to increase CSS specificity. Previously esbuild ignored this possibility and incorrectly considered `&&` to have the same specificity as `&`. With this release, this should now work correctly:\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code (color should be red) */\n        div {\n          && { color: red }\n          & { color: blue }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        div {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        div {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        div:is(div) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        div {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Thanks to [@&#8203;CPunisher](https://redirect.github.com/CPunisher) for working on a fix.\n\n    -   Previously transforming nested CSS incorrectly removed leading combinators from within pseudoclass selectors such as `:where()`. This edge case has been fixed and how has test coverage.\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        a b:has(> span) {\n          a & {\n            color: green;\n          }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        a :is(a b:has(span)) {\n          color: green;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        a :is(a b:has(> span)) {\n          color: green;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;NoremacNergfol](https://redirect.github.com/NoremacNergfol).\n\n    -   The CSS minifier contains logic to remove the `&` selector when it can be implied, which happens when there is only one and it's the leading token. However, this logic was incorrectly also applied to selector lists inside of pseudo-class selectors such as `:where()`. With this release, the minifier will now avoid applying this logic in this edge case:\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        .a {\n          & .b { color: red }\n          :where(& .b) { color: blue }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --minify) */\n        .a{.b{color:red}:where(.b){color:#&#8203;00f}}\n\n        /* New output (with --minify) */\n        .a{.b{color:red}:where(& .b){color:#&#8203;00f}}\n        ```\n\n-   Fix some correctness issues with source maps ([#&#8203;1745](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1745), [#&#8203;3183](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3183), [#&#8203;3613](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3613), [#&#8203;3982](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3982))\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly treated source map path references as file paths instead of as URLs. With this release, esbuild will now treat source map path references as URLs. This fixes the following problems with source maps:\n\n    -   File names in `sourceMappingURL` that contained a space previously did not encode the space as `%20`, which resulted in JavaScript tools (including esbuild) failing to read that path back in when consuming the generated output file. This should now be fixed.\n\n    -   Absolute URLs in `sourceMappingURL` that use the `file://` scheme previously attempted to read from a folder called `file:`. These URLs should now be recognized and parsed correctly.\n\n    -   Entries in the `sources` array in the source map are now treated as URLs instead of file paths. The correct behavior for this is much more clear now that source maps has a [formal specification](https://tc39.es/ecma426/). Many thanks to those who worked on the specification.\n\n-   Fix incorrect package for `@esbuild/netbsd-arm64` ([#&#8203;4018](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4018))\n\n    Due to a copy+paste typo, the binary published to `@esbuild/netbsd-arm64` was not actually for `arm64`, and didn't run in that environment. This release should fix running esbuild in that environment (NetBSD on 64-bit ARM). Sorry about the mistake.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with bitwise operators and bigints ([#&#8203;4065](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4065))\n\n    This change removes an incorrect assumption in esbuild that all bitwise operators result in a numeric integer. That assumption was correct up until the introduction of bigints in ES2020, but is no longer correct because almost all bitwise operators now operate on both numbers and bigints. Here's an example of the incorrect minification:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if ((a & b) !== 0) found = true\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    a&b&&(found=!0);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    (a&b)!==0&&(found=!0);\n    ```\n\n-   Fix esbuild incorrectly rejecting valid TypeScript edge case ([#&#8203;4027](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4027))\n\n    The following TypeScript code is valid:\n\n    ```ts\n    export function open(async?: boolean): void {\n      console.log(async as boolean)\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Before this version, esbuild would fail to parse this with a syntax error as it expected the token sequence `async as ...` to be the start of an async arrow function expression `async as => ...`. This edge case should be parsed correctly by esbuild starting with this release.\n\n-   Transform BigInt values into constructor calls when unsupported ([#&#8203;4049](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4049))\n\n    Previously esbuild would refuse to compile the BigInt literals (such as `123n`) if they are unsupported in the configured target environment (such as with `--target=es6`). The rationale was that they cannot be polyfilled effectively because they change the behavior of JavaScript's arithmetic operators and JavaScript doesn't have operator overloading.\n\n    However, this prevents using esbuild with certain libraries that would otherwise work if BigInt literals were ignored, such as with old versions of the [`buffer` library](https://redirect.github.com/feross/buffer) before the library fixed support for running in environments without BigInt support. So with this release, esbuild will now turn BigInt literals into BigInt constructor calls (so `123n` becomes `BigInt(123)`) and generate a warning in this case. You can turn off the warning with `--log-override:bigint=silent` or restore the warning to an error with `--log-override:bigint=error` if needed.\n\n-   Change how `console` API dropping works ([#&#8203;4020](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4020))\n\n    Previously the `--drop:console` feature replaced all method calls off of the `console` global with `undefined` regardless of how long the property access chain was (so it applied to `console.log()` and `console.log.call(console)` and `console.log.not.a.method()`). However, it was pointed out that this breaks uses of `console.log.bind(console)`. That's also incompatible with Terser's implementation of the feature, which is where this feature originally came from (it does support `bind`). So with this release, using this feature with esbuild will now only replace one level of method call (unless extended by `call` or `apply`) and will replace the method being called with an empty function in complex cases:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const x = console.log('x')\n    const y = console.log.call(console, 'y')\n    const z = console.log.bind(console)('z')\n\n    // Old output (with --drop-console)\n    const x = void 0;\n    const y = void 0;\n    const z = (void 0)(\"z\");\n\n    // New output (with --drop-console)\n    const x = void 0;\n    const y = void 0;\n    const z = (() => {\n    }).bind(console)(\"z\");\n    ```\n\n    This should more closely match Terser's existing behavior.\n\n-   Allow BigInt literals as `define` values\n\n    With this release, you can now use BigInt literals as define values, such as with `--define:FOO=123n`. Previously trying to do this resulted in a syntax error.\n\n-   Fix a bug with resolve extensions in `node_modules` ([#&#8203;4053](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4053))\n\n    The `--resolve-extensions=` option lets you specify the order in which to try resolving implicit file extensions. For complicated reasons, esbuild reorders TypeScript file extensions after JavaScript ones inside of `node_modules` so that JavaScript source code is always preferred to TypeScript source code inside of dependencies. However, this reordering had a bug that could accidentally change the relative order of TypeScript file extensions if one of them was a prefix of the other. That bug has been fixed in this release. You can see the issue for details.\n\n-   Better minification of statically-determined `switch` cases ([#&#8203;4028](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4028))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now try to trim unused code within `switch` statements when the test expression and `case` expressions are primitive literals. This can arise when the test expression is an identifier that is substituted for a primitive literal at compile time. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    switch (MODE) {\n      case 'dev':\n        installDevToolsConsole()\n        break\n      case 'prod':\n        return\n      default:\n        throw new Error\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify '--define:MODE=\"prod\"')\n    switch(\"prod\"){case\"dev\":installDevToolsConsole();break;case\"prod\":return;default:throw new Error}\n\n    // New output (with --minify '--define:MODE=\"prod\"')\n    return;\n    ```\n\n-   Emit `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` for string literals derived from property names ([#&#8203;4034](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4034))\n\n    Property name mangling is an advanced feature that shortens certain property names for better minification (I say \"advanced feature\" because it's very easy to break your code with it). Sometimes you need to store a property name in a string, such as `obj.get('foo')` instead of `obj.foo`. JavaScript minifiers such as esbuild and [Terser](https://terser.org/) have a convention where a `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comment before the string makes it behave like a property name. So `obj.get(/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */ 'foo')` allows the contents of the string `'foo'` to be shortened.\n\n    However, esbuild sometimes itself generates string literals containing property names when transforming code, such as when lowering class fields to ES6 or when transforming TypeScript decorators. Previously esbuild didn't generate its own `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comments in this case, which means that minifying your code by running esbuild again on its own output wouldn't work correctly (this does not affect people that both minify and transform their code in a single step).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now generate `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comments for property names in generated string literals. To avoid lots of unnecessary output for people that don't use this advanced feature, the generated comments will only be present when the feature is active. If you want to generate the comments but not actually mangle any property names, you can use a flag that has no effect such as `--reserve-props=.`, which tells esbuild to not mangle any property names (but still activates this feature).\n\n-   The `text` loader now strips the UTF-8 BOM if present ([#&#8203;3935](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3935))\n\n    Some software (such as Notepad on Windows) can create text files that start with the three bytes `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF`, which is referred to as the \"byte order mark\". This prefix is intended to be removed before using the text. Previously esbuild's `text` loader included this byte sequence in the string, which turns into a prefix of `\\uFEFF` in a JavaScript string when decoded from UTF-8. With this release, esbuild's `text` loader will now remove these bytes when they occur at the start of the file.\n\n-   Omit legal comment output files when empty ([#&#8203;3670](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3670))\n\n    Previously configuring esbuild with `--legal-comment=external` or `--legal-comment=linked` would always generate a `.LEGAL.txt` output file even if it was empty. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only do this if the file will be non-empty. This should result in a more organized output directory in some cases.\n\n-   Update Go from 1.23.1 to 1.23.5 ([#&#8203;4056](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4056), [#&#8203;4057](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4057))\n\n    This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain reports from vulnerability scanners that detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n    This PR was contributed by [@&#8203;MikeWillCook](https://redirect.github.com/MikeWillCook).\n\n-   Allow passing a port of 0 to the development server ([#&#8203;3692](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3692))\n\n    Unix sockets interpret a port of 0 to mean \"pick a random unused port in the [ephemeral port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port) range\". However, esbuild's default behavior when the port is not specified is to pick the first unused port starting from 8000 and upward. This is more convenient because port 8000 is typically free, so you can for example restart the development server and reload your app in the browser without needing to change the port in the URL. Since esbuild is written in Go (which does not have optional fields like JavaScript), not specifying the port in Go means it defaults to 0, so previously passing a port of 0 to esbuild caused port 8000 to be picked.\n\n    Starting with this release, passing a port of 0 to esbuild when using the CLI or the JS API will now pass port 0 to the OS, which will pick a random ephemeral port. To make this possible, the `Port` option in the Go API has been changed from `uint16` to `int` (to allow for additional sentinel values) and passing a port of -1 in Go now picks a random port. Both the CLI and JS APIs now remap an explicitly-provided port of 0 into -1 for the internal Go API.\n\n    Another option would have been to change `Port` in Go from `uint16` to `*uint16` (Go's closest equivalent of `number | undefined`). However, that would make the common case of providing an explicit port in Go very awkward as Go doesn't support taking the address of integer constants. This tradeoff isn't worth it as picking a random ephemeral port is a rare use case. So the CLI and JS APIs should now match standard Unix behavior when the port is 0, but you need to use -1 instead with Go API.\n\n-   Minification now avoids inlining constants with direct `eval` ([#&#8203;4055](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4055))\n\n    Direct `eval` can be used to introduce a new variable like this:\n\n    ```js\n    const variable = false\n    ;(function () {\n      eval(\"var variable = true\")\n      console.log(variable)\n    })()\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild inlined `variable` here (which became `false`), which changed the behavior of the code. This inlining is now avoided, but please keep in mind that direct `eval` breaks many assumptions that JavaScript tools hold about normal code (especially when bundling) and I do not recommend using it. There are usually better alternatives that have a more localized impact on your code. You can read more about this here: https://esbuild.github.io/link/direct-eval/\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.28.9`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.28.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.28.8...v3.28.9)\n\n##### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n##### 3.28.9 - 07 Feb 2025\n\n-   Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.20.4.

When we started using this form of translation we were still using de webpack builder. For testing functionality we were using \"ng build --watch --configuration=developent....\" with in angular.json \"localize\": true for the development configuration. Changed files were the only ones used in an incremental build and we could copy the build to a test-server for functional testing.\nAfter changing to esbuild (as of Angular 17) we noticed a change in behaviour when using the build in watch mode. If only 1 source file changed a whole new rebuild was made. When trying to find the cause of this change we also noticed this complete rebuild after using the touch command an a source file. Disabling localize in the development configuration will solve this change in behaviour, but then we can not test the translations with a regular development build.\n\nIs this change in watch-mode behaviour as it should be? We consider it a bug as this change in behaviour isn't documented.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nReproduction is simple.\nCreate a new app with \"ng new repro-app\" with defaults (CSS and no SSR).\nAdd localization with \"ng add @angular/localize\".\nMake no changes to angular.json.\n\nStart build in watch mode with \"ng build --watch --configuration development --localize=true\"\nMake a change to the stylesheet and see the complete rebuild.\n\nEnd the watch mode and start a new one with localize=false.\nMake another change to the stylesheet and see the incremental build (only stylesheet).\nThis is the same as using the webpack builder with localize=true.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.6\nNode: 20.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.6\n@angular/cli                    19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nWe're currently using Angular 18 for building web-apps but will be migrating to 19 soon. If there is a way to change this behaviour without change the current configurations (in angular.json) I would like to know.\n\nIf this isn't a bug I also would like to know. In this case we would have to change code in our development tool how dev. builds are made and how watch mode is started.\n\nThanks in

An error event can be received when defining a callback for `Worker.onerror` but this isn't of much help. The issue only occurs with external dependencies (even if the dependency is unused). In the minimal reproduction example I am using `comlink` but the same happens when importing something from `lodash`. Importing local scripts is working fine though.\nI have tried other major UI libraries like react, svelte and vue that have no problems with the any of the workers (despite the `optimizeDeps` issue with the vite bundler).\n\nProblematic code:\n```ts\nimport * as Comlink from 'comlink'; // even failing when not used further down\n\nconst obj = {\n    test() {\n        console.log(\"hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nonmessage = (message) => {\n    console.log(message.data, \"from worker with import\");\n}\n\nComlink.expose(obj);\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023b5238-7fbb-46f9-89bb-f9df50ac7a29)\n\nLoading the worker script had to be achieved by setting these settings in the `angular.json`:\n```json\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n        ...\n            \"assets\": [\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                \"input\": \"public\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                \"input\": \"node_modules/worker_package/dist\"\n              }\n            ],\n        ...\n        \"serve\": {\n          \"options\": {\n            \"prebundle\": false\n          },\n         ...\n```\nOtherwise I would be stuck with this issue: [https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994)\nI don't know if this would lead to the error condition I am experiencing.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created a repository for reproducing the problem: https://github.com/varfoer/comlink_worker_issues\nThe worker packages is already build there, so you can go ahead and try `npm i` and `npm start` or `npm run dev` in the several folders for the different UI libraries. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.5\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                    19.1.5\n@schematics/angular             19.1.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29574","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Importing packages with workers: workers that import external packages fail silently when called\" (#29574)"},{"Id":"2836437470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-06T20:25:54","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29582","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): also add `server.preTransformRequests`","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/5c1360179cec2f0fad6b2adb4a8e4d6930738976 moved `preTransformRequests` from the `server` to `dev` section.

Developers must manually add conditional logic in their templates to display a \"No records found\" or similar message.\n\nThis feature request proposes adding a `matNoDataNode `directive to <mat-tree>, similar to the `matNoDataRow `directive available for tables. The `matNoDataNode `directive would allow developers to define a template that is displayed when the tree's data source is empty.\n\nProposed Implementation:\n\n- A new directive, `matNoDataNode`, that conditionally renders a template when the tree's data source is empty.\n\n- Seamless integration with the existing mat-tree API, ensuring consistency with other Angular Material components.\n\n### Use Case\n\nhe `matNoDataNode `directive would enable the following use cases:\n\n1. Displaying a \"No Records Found\" Message\n\nWhen a tree has no data, developers can use `matNoDataNode `to display a user-friendly message, such as \"No records found\" or \"No data available.\"\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\">\n  <!-- Regular tree node definitions -->\n  <mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef=\"let node\">\n    {{ node.name }}\n  </mat-tree-node>\n\n  <!-- NoDataNode template -->\n  <ng-template matNoDataNode>\n    <div class=\"no-data-message\">No records found</div>\n  </ng-template>\n</mat-tree>\n```\n\n2. Custom Empty-State Templates\n\nDevelopers can define custom templates for empty states, including icons, buttons, or additional instructions.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<ng-template matNoDataNode>\n  <div class=\"no-data-message\">\n    <mat-icon>info</mat-icon>\n    <p>No data available.

The tree is now fully expanded.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMatTree's expandAll() should expand all nodes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the first level nodes are expanded.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.2\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTree): expandAll() only expand the first level\" (#30445)"},{"Id":"2829580732","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-04T09:22:44","Actor":"kai1992cool","Number":"30444","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen applying a theme like below:\n\n```\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  // font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n\n  @include mat.theme(\n    (\n      color: (\n        theme-type: light,\n        primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n      ),\n      typography: Roboto,\n      density: 0,\n    )\n  );\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nWithout the commented code in body tag, the `h1 to h6` tags do not have the default font-family.\n\n\n[Stackblitz mat.theme](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1?file=src%2Fstyles.scss)\n\n---\n\nIn the old method we had the `typography-hierarchy`, set this up and it works great:\n\n\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\n    $theme: mat.define-theme(\n      (\n        color: (\n          theme-type: light,\n          primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n        ),\n        typography: (\n          plain-family: Roboto,\n          brand-family: Open Sans,\n          bold-weight: 900,\n          medium-weight: 500,\n          regular-weight: 300,\n        ),\n        density: (\n          scale: 0,\n        ),\n      )\n    );\n    body {\n      @include mat.core();\n      @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\n    }\n\n    @include mat.typography-hierarchy($theme);\n\n    html {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n[Stackblitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1-ul8bwde7?file=src%2Fstyles.scss,src%2Fmain.ts)\n\nSo the question is how to define the typography for `h1-h6` with `mat.theme(`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nway to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nno way to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material:19\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30444","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`\" (#30444)"},{"Id":"2828749072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T23:09:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30443","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix failing test","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a test that's failing at head.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix failing test\" (#30443)"},{"Id":"2828419177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T20:07:44","Actor":"pcurrivan","Number":"30442","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(MatFormFieldControl): Update \"Creating a Custom Form Field Control\" for Signals","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThis is probably already on your TODO list, but in [this guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control), the first example (\"Form field with custom telephone number input control.\") has a typescript file using Signals and Signal effects, but the rest of the guide does not mention Signals.  It would be great to have the guide re-written using Signals.  Creating a custom form field control can already be quite complicated, and Signals are a new concept, so having these docs up to date would be very helpful.

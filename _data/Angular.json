30 seconds to do a rebuild, now it takes around 5 minutes.\n\nI have narrowed this down to `@angular-devkit/build-angular` by reducing versions of libraries, running builds and seeing how long it takes, I can run the application with all angular versions at `20.2.x` but `@angular-devkit/build-angular` at `20.1.6` and the build speeds return to normal\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI'm not sure how to give instructions to rerpoduce this issue as it requires a large app but if you have a large app on the latest version of angular, useing `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` for the builder\n- Run serve, note how long it takes\n- Change a file, note how long a rebuild takes\n\nthen downgrade `@angular-devkit/build-angular` to `20.1.6`, re run serve and note the new times\n\nI'm happy to run some debug tasks but I'm not sure what to run at this point.\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.2.2\nNode: 22.20.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.3\nOS: win32 x64\n\n\nAngular: 20.2.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2002.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.2.2\n@angular-devkit/core            20.2.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.2.2\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.3\n@angular/cli                    20.2.2\n@angular/youtube-player         19.1.2\n@schematics/angular             20.2.2\nng-packagr                      20.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.9.2\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n\n\nI am also running NX 21.5.2\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nUpdating to es build makes things better but i have also noticed running tests is slower than usual too","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31350","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dramatic increase in build time for @angular-devkit/build-angular >= 20.2.x\" (#31350)"},{"Id":"3470972880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-30T20:26:29","Actor":"devchas","Number":"31349","RawContent":null,"Title":"AI tools selection not working","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe answer to `Which AI tools do you want to configure with Angular best practices?` always shows `None` even when selecting options other than `None`.\n\n<img width=\"2496\" height=\"1180\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4530fb57-ce3e-4fdf-8445-ca8aa90f1d04\" />\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThe answer to `Which AI tools do you want to configure with Angular best practices?` always shows `None` even when selecting options other than `None`.\n\n<img width=\"2496\" height=\"1180\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4530fb57-ce3e-4fdf-8445-ca8aa90f1d04\" />\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\n\nAngular CLI: 21.0.0-next.5\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\n\nAngular: 21.0.0-next.5\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2100.0-next.5\n@angular-devkit/core         21.0.0-next.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics   21.0.0-next.5\n@schematics/angular          21.0.0-next.5\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.9.2\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31349","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AI tools selection not working\" (#31349)"},{"Id":"3470964155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-30T20:23:33","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31348","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add `browserViewport` option for vitest browser tests","State":"open","Body":"Introduces a new option, `browserViewport`, to the unit-test builder to allow configuring the browser's viewport size during test execution.\r\n\r\nThis option accepts a string in the format `widthxheight` (e.g., `1280x720`) and is passed to the underlying browser provider when using the Vitest runner.

But even if it was possible the code would be full of checks on what mode is Angular running, and having to deal with all the states instead of just handling a normal case of -> open the url -> render angular -> serve html. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd a flag to disable route extraction during build or serve totally, at least just for development purposes. \nWhen routes are dynamically loaded based on config, having the extraction happen before the config can be loaded breaks the dynamic apps.

The most problematic aspect is that this transformation is also applied to pre-built, third-party packages from node_modules.\n\nThis unnecessarily inflates file sizes (often by 2-3x), which slows down page loads in development and makes debugging in browser DevTools more difficult due to the massive file content. The core issue is that the configuration to disable this behavior is not being respected. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.  Create a new Angular project:\n    ```bash\n    ng new sourcemap-repro\n    cd sourcemap-repro\n    ```\n2.  In `angular.json`, modify the configuration for the development server to explicitly disable all source maps. Under `projects.sourcemap-repro.architect.build.configurations.development`, set the `sourceMap` option:\n    ```json\n    \"sourceMap\": false\n    ```\n    *(Alternatively, using a more granular object like `{\"scripts\": false, \"styles\": false, \"vendor\": false}` also fails to prevent the issue.)*\n\n3.  Run the development server:\n    ```bash\n    ng serve\n    ```\n4.  Open the application in a browser and launch the developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).\n5.  Navigate to the \"Network\" tab, refresh the page, and inspect any `.js` file (e.g., `main.js`, `polyfills.js`, or a chunk from `@angular/core`).\n6.  View the \"Response\" or \"Source\" for that file.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe served JavaScript files should **not** contain an inline source map. The file should end without a `//# sourceMappingURL=...` comment.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nEvery JavaScript file has a large inline Base64 source map appended to it, directly contradicting the configuration in `angular.json`.\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.14\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.15\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.14\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.14\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.14\n@angular/cli                    19.2.14\n@angular/compiler               19.2.14\n@angular/compiler-cli           19.2.14\n@angular/language-service       19.2.14\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nng-packagr                      18.2.1\ntypescript                      5.7.2\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n<img width=\"793\" height=\"356\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22cd3964-aa0d-432a-987a-eb50664007de\" />","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31331","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve with esbuild/Vite ignores sourceMap configuration, injecting large inline source maps into all files\" (#31331)"},{"Id":"3460928775","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-28T01:30:28","Actor":"rajinder-yadav","Number":"31328","RawContent":null,"Title":"vitest requires zone.js when angular is moving away from this","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nvitest setup for angular app that is zoneless, result in the following error:\n\nError: NG0908: In this configuration Angular requires Zone.js\n\nRef: https://angular.dev/guide/testing/unit-tests\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a zoneless angular app, add vitest, see error.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: NG0908: In this configuration Angular requires Zone.js\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.3\nNode: 22.20.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.15.0\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: <error>\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.3\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.3\n@schematics/angular          20.3.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31328","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"vitest requires zone.js when angular is moving away from this\" (#31328)"},{"Id":"3459440417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-27T00:21:28","Actor":"wein2011","Number":"31321","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Vitest]: Add viewport configuration to angular.json","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nThe new Vitest unit-test configuration is missing the viewport configuration.

Open the console\n2. Select a date\n3. See that values from `(dateChange)` event and from the form control are equals\n4. Select a time\n5. See that the value from the form control is incorrect because it was not yet changed when `(selected)` or `(valueChange)` were fired\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect MatTimePicker behavior to be consistent with MatDatePicker and set formControl value before firing events. So we can easily grab the form value (possibly including other values from other controls) and do something with that.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen the event is fired, the value from form control is not changed. If reading that value, then inconsistent behavior may be introduced.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2.5\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.5\n- Browser(s): Chrome","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31950","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(timepicker): timepicker fire events before updating formControl value\" (#31950)"},{"Id":"3467584889","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-30T15:16:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31945","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update bazel dependencies (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rules_nodejs](https://redirect.github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_nodejs) | bazel_dep | patch | `6.5.0` -> `6.5.2` |\n| [yq.bzl](https://redirect.github.com/bazel-contrib/yq.bzl) | bazel_dep | minor | `0.2.0` -> `0.3.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazel-contrib/rules_nodejs (rules_nodejs)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.5.2`](https://redirect.github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_nodejs/releases/tag/v6.5.2)\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6 or greater\n\n1.

In case a component is attached, I need to adapt the styling.\n\nLets take the following example, my expectation initially was that the class will be set correctly.\n\n```\nmyOutlet = viewChild(CdkPortalOutlet);\n\n<my-child [portalOutlet]=\"myOutlet()\"/> // outlet gets passed to children which will attach components\n<section [class.attached]=\"myOutlet().portal\">\n  <ng-container cdkPortalOutlet></ng-container>\n</section>\n```\nThe issue though is that `myOutlet` is only initialized once and changes to the `portal` within are not tracked if there is no other event triggering change detection at the same time. So the code above can actually get out-of-sync.\n\nThe best workaround I found is to manually keep track of the attachment/detachment.\nThis is more complex than it should be and my example is also possibly missing cleanup code\n\n```\nmyOutlet = viewChild(CdkPortalOutlet);\nisOutletAttached = signal(false);\n\neffect(() => {\n    this.myOutlet()?.attached.subscribe(() => {\n      this.isOutletAttached.set(true);\n      this.myOutlet().attachedRef?.onDestroy(() => this.isOutletAttached.set(false));\n    });\n });\n\n<section [class.attached]=\"isOutletAttached()\">...</section>\n```\n\nIdeally one of the internal members of the `CdkPortalOutlet` should expose a signal which can be used.\n\n```\nmyOutlet = viewChild(CdkPortalOutlet);\n\n// multiple options\n<section [class.attached]=\"myOutlet().portal()\">...</section>\n<section [class.attached]=\"myOutlet().attachedRef()\">...</section>\n<section [class.attached]=\"myOutlet().isAttached()\">...</section>\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31929","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(CdkPortalOutlet): Introduce signal-friendly way to track portal attachment/detachment\" (#31929)"},{"Id":"3453910032","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-25T14:30:18","Actor":"richarddesan","Number":"31927","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAngular: 18.2\n\n### Description\n\nThis is a follow up of https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30187\n\nThat fix works, but not for dialogs in a tree view\n\nconst ok = await firstValueFrom(\n      this.matDialog.open(AddNodeDialogComponent, { data, maxHeight: '90vh', width: '650px', autoFocus: 'first-heading', restoreFocus: true }).afterClosed(),\n    );\n\nBlocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus.

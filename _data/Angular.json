This commit cleans it up and removes a lot of unneeded code.\r\n\r\nThis commit also removes `ts` import in typescript_host.ts and use `tss`\r\ninstead to make it less confusing.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

There is a root <SVG> tag then Angular dynamically adds component into it, that are SVG as well.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the HTML is something like \r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n<my-app>\r\n  <svg>\r\n    <g>\r\n      <svg>\r\n        <svg>\r\n          <rect></rect>\r\n        </svg>\r\n      </svg>\r\n    </g>\r\n  </svg>\r\n</my-app>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith IVY enabled, you can see the svg in the inspector but it is not rendered by the browser. If you disable IVY it works.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSince IVY is not supported by Stackblitz, here's a repo : https://github.com/Yohandah/Nested-SVG-Angular-9-IVY \r\n\r\nSteps :\r\n\r\n- Clone the repo\r\n- Install dependencies (npm install)\r\n- run `ng serve`\r\n- You can see a blank page, but if you inspect, you will see the SVG\r\n- Cancel `ng serve`\r\n- add the following to `tsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"compilerOptions\": {},\r\n\"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n  \"enableIvy\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- run `ng serve` \r\n- You can see the SVG produced (with your eyes, and in the inspector)\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nthere is no error\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** \r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\nNode:

InheritDefinitionFeature is present on parent def","State":"open","Body":"The main logic of the `InheritDefinitionFeature` is to go through the prototype chain of a given Component and merge all Angular-specific information onto that Component def. The problem happens in case there is a Component in a hierarchy that also contains the `InheritDefinitionFeature` (i.e. it extends some other Component), so it inherits all Angular-specific information from its super class. As a result, the root Component may end up having duplicate information inherited from different Components in hierarchy.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the following structure: `GrandChild` extends `Child` that extends `Base` and the `Base` class has a `HostListener`. In this scenario `GrandChild` and `Child` will have `InheritDefinitionFeature` included into the `features` list. The processing will happend in the following order:\r\n\r\n- `Child` inherits `HostListener` from the `Base` class\r\n- `GrandChild` inherits `HostListener` from the `Child` class\r\n- since `Child` has a parent, `GrandChild` also inherits from the `Base` class\r\n\r\nThe result is that the `GrandChild` def has duplicated host listener, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces additional logic that checks whether we came across a def that has `InheritDefinitionFeature` feature (which means that this def already inherited information from its super classes). If that's the case, we skip further fields-related inheritance logic, but keep going though the prototype chain to look for super classes that contain other features (like NgOnChanges), that we need to invoke for a given Component def.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves #33300.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34244","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): skip field inheritance if InheritDefinitionFeature is present on parent def\" (#34244)"},{"Id":"533057658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T01:01:58","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"34242","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(ivy): `class_binding` benchmark fixes","State":"open","Body":"This commit fixes a couple issues that prevent `class_binding` benchmark from running: moving constants requires by the `benchmark` function before function declaration and referencing correct consts in template instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34242","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(ivy): `class_binding` benchmark fixes\" (#34242)"},{"Id":"533039799","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T00:30:33","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"34241","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): do not invoke change detection for destroyed views","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this commit, calling change detection for destroyed views resulted in errors being thrown in some cases.

For instance, you won’t be able to bundle `pg` (if you use postgres) as well as internal deps of `mongoose` (or `bcrypt`)  because they use a native node.js binaries (C++ code)\r\n- sometimes you may not want to obfuscate class names, properties names, function names etc because there are important for libraries such as Typeorm (to automatically create columns with proper names in a database) or e.g. NestJS. Having full control over what can be optimized for server-side is quite important here\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen I try to set `bundleDependencies` to `none` under `server` configuration in `angular.json`, the application will stop working:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23244943/70067354-6b9be500-15ee-11ea-9ff0-35de65eef423.png)\r\n\r\nBoth `serve:ssr` and `serve:ssr:dev` won't work.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not entirely sure how I can determine the behavior of webpack for the server part now. Previously, we had `webpack.server.config` in which we could simply use plugins like `nodeExternals` or set `optimization` to false (to avoid code minification). This is worth adding to the docs (how to accomplish this now with a new setup).\r\n\r\n#### What modules are related to this issue?\r\n```\r\n- [ ] aspnetcore-engine\r\n- [ ] common\r\n- [ ] express-engine\r\n- [ ] hapi-engine\r\n- [ ] module-map-ngfactory-loader\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Minimal reproduction with instructions:\r\n\r\nNo reproduction needed - new Angular app with `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next` (or any other engine)\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\n\r\nMainly full-stack applications, compatibility with other Node.js platforms\r\n\r\n#### Environment:\r\n**@nguniversal versions**\r\n  - aspnetcore-engine: \r\n  - common:\r\n  - express-engine: 9.0.0-next.7\r\n  - hapi-engine:\r\n  -

(xliffmerge.json for ngx-i18nsupport) My script (below if someone wants it) is maybe not optimal, but it works fine and I need only 1 production config for all languages.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to ng serve, I still need a build configuration for every language in order to set the locale and xlf file.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"en\": {\r\n              \"aot\": true,\r\n              \"i18nLocale\": \"en\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"de\": {\r\n              \"aot\": true,\r\n              \"i18nFile\": \"locale/messages.de.xlf\",\r\n              \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\",\r\n              \"i18nLocale\": \"de\",\r\n              \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"warning\"\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case I also need to pass port, baseHref and publicHost to ng serve as I run ng serve behind an asp.net spa proxy that serves all the languages at once. This parameters can be passed in using the ng serve parameters or by angular.json.\r\n\r\nMy build script:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\nconst {execSync} = require('child_process');\r\n\r\nvar execOptions = {\r\n  encoding: 'utf8'\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get languages from xliffmergeOptions\r\nlet rawdata = fs.readFileSync('../appsettings.json');\r\nlet xliffmergeOptions = JSON.parse(rawdata).xliffmergeOptions;\r\nlet defaultLanguage = xliffmergeOptions.defaultLanguage;\r\nlet additionalLanguages = xliffmergeOptions.languages;\r\nlet languages = [defaultLanguage, ...xliffmergeOptions.languages];\r\n\r\n// Some console info\r\nconsole.info('Build started for: ', languages);\r\n\r\n// Run i18n-extract & merge xliff files\r\nconsole.log(execSync('npm run i18n', execOptions));\r\n\r\n// Build default language\r\nconsole.log(execSync(`npm run ng build -- -c production --outputPath=dist/${defaultLanguage} --baseHref=/${defaultLanguage}/app/ --i18nLocale=${defaultLanguage}`, execOptions));\r\n\r\n// Build additional languagses\r\nfor (const language of additionalLanguages) {\r\n  console.log(execSync(`npm run ng build -- -c production --outputPath=dist/${language} --baseHref=/${language}/app/ --i18nLocale=${language} --i18nFile=locale/messages.${language}.xlf --i18nFormat=xlf --i18nMissingTranslation=warning`, execOptions));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Some console info\r\nconsole.info('Build finished for: ', languages);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like to have parameters for ng-serve, that i can use to change the build configuration options that are related to i18n. Maybe something like:\r\n\r\nng serve --build:i18nlocale=de --build:i18nFile=....\r\n\r\nBy that one could simply create a script that can serve any language configured in some config file similar to my bild script. So when adding a new language you would simply add that language to your config file.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nFor the moment I have a build and serve config for each language and one npm script per language. I also thought about using ng config in a script to change the prod configuration before launching ng serve and then change it back, but that feels somehow bad.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Pass-though of build parameters to ng serve\" (#16347)"},{"Id":"532505688","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-04T07:43:45","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16344","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add notice when using bundleDepen…","State":"open","Body":"…dencies: none with Ivy\r\n\r\nRelated to: https://github.com/angular/universal/issues/1354","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16344","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add notice when using bundleDepen…\" (#16344)"},{"Id":"532027486","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:37:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Library imports","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n- Currently the library schematic doesn't support adding a secondary entry-point and having deep imports is not recommanded.\r\n\r\nIt's best if paths are more stricter when having a secondary entry-point instead of a wildcard.\r\n\r\nInstead of :\r\n```\r\n\"lib/*\": [\r\n  \"dist/lib/*\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers should configure:\r\n```\r\n\"lib/secondary\": [\r\n  \"dist/lib/secondary\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow a better DX experience when using auto imports in IDE's.\r\n\r\nCloses: #15952","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16340","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Library imports\" (#16340)"},{"Id":"532054476","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T15:11:40","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"16341","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve should watch messages files","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the new i18n support with CLI v9 (rc.4 at the time of writing), it is possible to run:\r\n    \r\n    ng serve --configuration=fr\r\n\r\nwith `fr`:\r\n```json\r\n\"i18n\": {\r\n  \"locales\": {\r\n    \"fr\": \"src/locale/messages.fr.xlf\"\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n\"fr\": {\r\n  \"localize\": [\"fr\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works great, but does not pick up translation changes in `messages.fr.xlf`, requiring a stop and restart of `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have `ng serve` watch the files defined in the `locales` configuration.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIt is possible to stop and restart the server to have the up-to-date translations.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16341","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve should watch messages files\" (#16341)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"533707550","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-06T02:26:26","Actor":"long20014","Number":"17887","RawContent":null,"Title":"(Bug) The examples is not displayed correctly as on the material.angular.io ","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-testign?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

button as an input binding","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI think the current implementation of the radio-buttons in relation to the the radio-group is very limiting, you cannot use the radio group in a custom parent control and the radio button in custom child controls. \r\nConsider implementing the `radioGroup` property of the radio button as an `@Input()` binding.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario: I would like to create an abstraction for rendering questionnaires, the html code might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mnc-questionnaire [entityKey]=\"'QST_THE_FIRST_QUESTIONNIARE'\"\r\n  [questionnaireForm]=\"questionnaireForm\">\r\n  <mnc-question [entityKey]=\"'Q_FIRST_QUESTION'\">\r\n    What do you think of the first question?\r\n\r\n    <mnc-answer-options-group>\r\n      <mnc-answer-option-radio [entityKey]=\"'A_OPTION_A'\">Option A</mnc-answer-option-radio>\r\n      <mnc-answer-option-radio [entityKey]=\"'A_OPTION_B'\">Option B</mnc-answer-option-radio>\r\n      <mnc-answer-option-radio [entityKey]=\"'A_OPTION_C'\">Option C</mnc-answer-option-radio>\r\n    </mnc-answer-options-group>\r\n  </mnc-question>\r\n\r\n  <mnc-question [entityKey]=\"'Q_SECOND_QUESTION'\">\r\n    What about the second question?\r\n    <mnc-answer-options-group>\r\n      <mnc-answer-option-radio [entityKey]=\"'A_OPTION_1'\">Ok that's fine</mnc-answer-option-radio>\r\n      <mnc-answer-option-radio [entityKey]=\"'A_OPTION_2'\">Sorry, I don't agree</mnc-answer-option-radio>\r\n    </mnc-answer-options-group>\r\n  </mnc-question>\r\n</mnc-questionnaire>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe template for the `mnc-answer-options-group` might look like:\r\n```\r\n<section [formGroup]=\"parentForm\">\r\n  <section [formGroupName]=\"formGroupName\">\r\n    <mat-radio-group class=\"answer-options-radio-group\"\r\n      [formControlName]=\"parent.entityKey\">\r\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n    </mat-radio-group>\r\n  </section>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd template for the `mnc-answer-option-radio`:\r\n```\r\n<mat-radio-button\r\n  class=\"answer-radio-button\"\r\n  [value]=\"entityKey\">\r\n  <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n</mat-radio-button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current implementation expects the radio group to be a direct ancestor for the radio buttons (it is injected via the constructor), so it is not working for my use (different scope: parent vs child component).\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be (besides the @Optional() constructor injection) to make the `radioGroup` property an `@Input()` binding\r\n\r\n#### Temporary solution\r\nFor anyone struggling with this scenario: for now I solved this by simply subclassing the `MatRadioButton`, but I'd rather not do that because of any future breaking changes that might occur. \r\n\r\nHere is my simple solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  moduleId: module.id,\r\n  selector: 'mnc-radio-button',\r\n  templateUrl: './mnc-radio-button.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls:

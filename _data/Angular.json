[Accordingly to the official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#clear-secondary-routes) I should be able to navigate away from the named outlet by simply null-ying it's navigation path:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclosePopup() {\r\n  // Providing a `null` value to the named outlet\r\n  // clears the contents of the named outlet\r\n  this.router.navigate([{ outlets: { popup: null }}]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is not possible at all unless I use *a parent route* of a route where named outlet is located.\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem is that a named outlet is used not on the app's root level but inside a lazy-loaded module? Or that the parent of the named outlet has an empty path?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/1206777/a00fbeda-f1bb-40db-aaa2-7d15b78bb29f)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this is expected behavior I would be thankful for an explanation why the code from the official documentations doesn't work in my case and what is going on underneath.

This is done by running change detection traversal multiple times while there are still transplanted views that need to be refreshed.\r\n\r\nThis same approach can be used for signal-based views to eliminate the `ExpressionChangedAfterItWasCheckedError` when signal updates during change detection cause a view to become dirty (again or for the first time).\r\n\r\nSeveral options were identified for rerunning dirty views after they were already checked:\r\n\r\n1. Keep track of the dirty views in a global set and just iterate through the set at the end of change detection\r\n2. Rerun `detectChangesInView` immediately (right after it has run)\r\n3. Rerun `detectChangesInView` at the top, as done in this commit\r\n\r\nThe first option is a bit more complicated than it seems. Because of detached views, refreshing a view outside of traversal is difficult. It requires keeping track of \"change detection roots\" (either the actual root of the CD tree or the first parent/ancestor that is detached). So when running a change detection that causes other views to become dirty, we have to ensure that everything in the set has the same root and potentially even that the dirty view is a actually a descendant of the current change detection (that is, `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges` could start somewhere other than the root).\r\n\r\nAnother issue that also exists with the second option is the possibility of potentially refreshing a view more times than necessary when this strategy is applied to signal-based views. Take a\r\nsimple example of A->B->C where C is a child of B and B is a child of A. C is `CheckAlways` and both `A` and `B` are signal-based. If they are all dirty initially and traversal goes to A, then B, then C and C causes both A and B to be dirty again, if B re-executes first then it will also run C again. Then A reruns and if it causes B to be dirty again, B and C (once again) will refresh.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the third option (and what is proposed in this commit) performs better. Rerunning from the root ensures that C is only rechecked one additional time rather than 2. A reruns, B reruns, and then C because it is `CheckAlways`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51361","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): Ensure backwards-referenced transplanted views are refreshed\" (#51361)"},{"Id":"1850355563","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-14T21:31:20","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"51355","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add CDN Optimization section to hydration guide","State":"closed","Body":"This adds a section to cover the case of CDNs that have optimizations that will break both Angular and Hydration by stripping comment nodes.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51355","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: Add CDN Optimization section to hydration guide\" (#51355)"},{"Id":"1850462961","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-14T20:48:54","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"51358","RawContent":null,"Title":"Local compilation revert","State":"closed","Body":"This PR reverts https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51293 and https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51309","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51358","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Local compilation revert\" (#51358)"},{"Id":"1850350264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-14T19:52:44","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"51354","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"ci: migrate aio jobs to GHA (#51071)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 12dbe1a6cf92b006aa1c6164c525646380bf37af.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51354","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"ci: migrate aio jobs to GHA (#51071)\"\" (#51354)"},{"Id":"1850416000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-14T19:35:02","Actor":"ioancris","Number":"51357","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unhandled rejections events not emitted when using DISABLE_WRAPPING_UNCAUGHT_PROMISE_REJECTION","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nzone.js\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nSetting `DISABLE_WRAPPING_UNCAUGHT_PROMISE_REJECTION` to true will cause unhandled rejections events to not be emitted because of an exception inside the code that sends the events.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n__zone_symbol__DISABLE_WRAPPING_UNCAUGHT_PROMISE_REJECTION = true;\r\n// load zone.js\r\nonunhandledrejection = console.dir;\r\nPromise.reject(new Error(\"forced error\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code doesn't call the unhandled rejection handler.

Type selectors may now be used with CSS nesting:\n\n    ```css\n    .foo {\n      div {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously this was disallowed in the CSS specification because it's ambiguous whether an identifier is a declaration or a nested rule starting with a type selector without requiring unbounded lookahead in the parser. It has now been allowed because the CSS working group has decided that requiring unbounded lookahead is acceptable after all.\n\n    Note that this change means esbuild no longer considers any existing browser to support CSS nesting since none of the existing browsers support this new syntax. CSS nesting will now always be transformed when targeting a browser. This situation will change in the future as browsers add support for this new syntax.\n\n-   Fix a scope-related bug with `--drop-labels=` ([#&#8203;3311](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3311))\n\n    The recently-released `--drop-labels=` feature previously had a bug where esbuild's internal scope stack wasn't being restored properly when a statement with a label was dropped. This could manifest as a tree-shaking issue, although it's possible that this could have also been causing other subtle problems too. The bug has been fixed in this release.\n\n-   Make renamed CSS names unique across entry points ([#&#8203;3295](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3295))\n\n    Previously esbuild's generated names for local names in CSS were only unique within a given entry point (or across all entry points when code splitting was enabled). That meant that building multiple entry points with esbuild could result in local names being renamed to the same identifier even when those entry points were built simultaneously within a single esbuild API call. This problem was especially likely to happen with minification enabled. With this release, esbuild will now avoid renaming local names from two separate entry points to the same name if those entry points were built with a single esbuild API call, even when code splitting is disabled.\n\n-   Fix CSS ordering bug with `@layer` before `@import`\n\n    CSS lets you put `@layer` rules before `@import` rules to define the order of layers in a stylesheet. Previously esbuild's CSS bundler incorrectly ordered these after the imported files because before the introduction of cascade layers to CSS, imported files could be bundled by removing the `@import` rules and then joining files together in the right order. But with `@layer`, CSS files may now need to be split apart into multiple pieces in the bundle. For example:\n\n        /* Original code */\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;import \"data:text/css,@&#8203;layer inner.start;\";\n        @&#8203;import \"data:text/css,@&#8203;layer inner.end;\";\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n        /* Old output (with --bundle) */\n        @&#8203;layer inner.start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.end;\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n        /* New output (with --bundle) */\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.end;\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n-   Unwrap nested duplicate `@media` rules ([#&#8203;3226](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3226))\n\n    With this release, esbuild's CSS minifier will now automatically unwrap duplicate nested `@media` rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      .foo { color: red }\n      @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px) {\n        .bar { color: blue }\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.foo{color:red}@&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.bar{color:#&#8203;00f}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.foo{color:red}.bar{color:#&#8203;00f}}\n    ```\n\n    These rules are unlikely to be authored manually but may result from using frameworks such as Tailwind to generate CSS.\n\n### [`v0.19.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0191)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1)\n\n-   Fix a regression with `baseURL` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3307](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3307))\n\n    The previous release moved `tsconfig.json` path resolution before `--packages=external` checks to allow the [`paths` field](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) in `tsconfig.json` to avoid a package being marked as external. However, that reordering accidentally broke the behavior of the `baseURL` field from `tsconfig.json`. This release moves these path resolution rules around again in an attempt to allow both of these cases to work.\n\n-   Parse TypeScript type arguments for JavaScript decorators ([#&#8203;3308](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3308))\n\n    When parsing JavaScript decorators in TypeScript (i.e. with `experimentalDecorators` disabled), esbuild previously didn't parse type arguments. Type arguments will now be parsed starting with this release. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    @&#8203;foo<number>\n    @&#8203;bar<number, string>()\n    class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix glob patterns matching extra stuff at the end ([#&#8203;3306](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3306))\n\n    Previously glob patterns such as `./*.js` would incorrectly behave like `./*.js*` during path matching (also matching `.js.map` files, for example). This was never intentional behavior, and has now been fixed.\n\n-   Change the permissions of esbuild's generated output files ([#&#8203;3285](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3285))\n\n    This release changes the permissions of the output files that esbuild generates to align with the default behavior of node's [`fs.writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options) function. Since most tools written in JavaScript use `fs.writeFileSync`, this should make esbuild more consistent with how other JavaScript build tools behave.\n\n    The full Unix-y details: Unix permissions use three-digit octal notation where the three digits mean \"user, group, other\" in that order. Within a digit, 4 means \"read\" and 2 means \"write\" and 1 means \"execute\". So 6 == 4 + 2 == read + write. Previously esbuild uses 0644 permissions (the leading 0 means octal notation) but the permissions for `fs.writeFileSync` defaults to 0666, so esbuild will now use 0666 permissions. This does not necessarily mean that the files esbuild generates will end up having 0666 permissions, however, as there is another Unix feature called \"umask\" where the operating system masks out some of these bits. If your umask is set to 0022 then the generated files will have 0644 permissions, and if your umask is set to 0002 then the generated files will have 0664 permissions.\n\n-   Fix a subtle CSS ordering issue with `@import` and `@layer`\n\n    With this release, esbuild may now introduce additional `@layer` rules when bundling CSS to better preserve the layer ordering of the input code. Here's an example of an edge case where this matters:\n\n    ```css\n    /* entry.css */\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"b.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This CSS should set the body background to `green`, which is what happens in the browser. Previously esbuild generated the following output which incorrectly sets the body background to `red`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This difference in behavior is because the browser evaluates `a.css` + `b.css` + `a.css` (in CSS, each `@import` is replaced with a copy of the imported file) while esbuild was only writing out `b.css` + `a.css`. The first copy of `a.css` wasn't being written out by esbuild for two reasons: 1) bundlers care about code size and try to avoid emitting duplicate CSS and 2) when there are multiple copies of a CSS file, normally only the *last* copy matters since the last declaration with equal specificity wins in CSS.\n\n    However, `@layer` was recently added to CSS and for `@layer` the *first* copy matters because layers are ordered using their first location in source code order. This introduction of `@layer` means esbuild needs to change its bundling algorithm. An easy solution would be for esbuild to write out `a.css` twice, but that would be inefficient. So what I'm going to try to have esbuild do with this release is to write out an abbreviated form of the first copy of a CSS file that only includes the `@layer` information, and then still only write out the full CSS file once for the last copy. So esbuild's output for this edge case now looks like this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a;\n\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The behavior of the bundled CSS now matches the behavior of the unbundled CSS. You may be wondering why esbuild doesn't just write out `a.css` first followed by `b.css`. That would work in this case but it doesn't work in general because for any rules outside of a `@layer` rule, the last copy should still win instead of the first copy.\n\n-   Fix a bug with esbuild's TypeScript type definitions ([#&#8203;3299](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3299))\n\n    This release fixes a copy/paste error with the TypeScript type definitions for esbuild's JS API:\n\n    ```diff\n     export interface TsconfigRaw {\n       compilerOptions?: {\n    -    baseUrl?: boolean\n    +    baseUrl?: string\n         ...\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;privatenumber](https://togithub.com/privatenumber).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.47.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.47.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.46.0...v8.47.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`53d7508`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/53d750800b1c0c1f8c29393c488bb3167bb1d2a5) feat: update regex for methods with `thisArg` ([#&#8203;17439](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17439)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`631648e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/631648ee0b51a8951ce576ccd4430e09c9c8bcae) fix: do not report on shadowed constructors in `no-new-wrappers` ([#&#8203;17447](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17447)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`a766a48`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a766a48030d4359db76523d5b413d6332130e485) docs: document lack of config file names ([#&#8203;17442](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17442)) (James)\n-   [`a1635d6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a1635d6198a8baf6571b3351e098e5ac960be887) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`47a0859`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/47a08597966651975126dd6726939cd34f13b80e) docs: update `require-unicode-regexp.md` as following up [#&#8203;17402](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17402) ([#&#8203;17441](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17441)) (SUZUKI Sosuke)\n-   [`fcdc85d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/fcdc85d3a6bc14970c3349cc8d6f3a47eca172a3) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2a92b6c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2a92b6cc9520a27255520369206556e9841a3af8) docs: update with \"Specifying Parser Options\" ([#&#8203;17435](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17435)) (Cheol-Won)\n-   [`d743ed3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/d743ed3c06c62a639da0389ad27907b324ea1715) docs: add metadata for parser/processor ([#&#8203;17438](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17438)) (Huáng Jùnliàng)\n-   [`224376c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/224376cd99a08394291a9584ad9c1ea1283673c6) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`a41a8e4`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a41a8e4a7da14726d6fce71a023f12101fd52fdb) docs: update script names in README ([#&#8203;17432](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17432)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`bf69aa6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/bf69aa6408f5403a88d8c9b71b0e58232b1ea833) chore: Update dependencies ([#&#8203;17456](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17456)) (Nicholas C.

Description\r\n\r\nI have the following component template for a sign-in page\r\n\r\n- if the user is signed in, we show some user info\r\n- else we show the login form\r\n- we also have some content inside the `@else` block for diagnostic purposes\r\n  - \"user with div\" -  text inside an html tag\r\n  - \"user without div\" - text existing without an html tag\r\n- this is a zoneless app\r\n- change detection strategy was onPush\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"rounded-md bg-white shadow shadow-z1 p-4 px-8\">\r\n  @if (user$(); as user) {\r\n  <fa-icon [icon]=\"icons.faCheckCircle\" class=\"mx-auto text-xl text-emerald-400\"></fa-icon>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"text-center text-sm\">\r\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">Signed in as</p>\r\n    <p class=\"mt-2\">{{user.displayName}}</p>\r\n    <p class=\"text-gray-500\">{{user.email}}</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <button class=\"mt-8 mx-auto text-sm stroked-button\" mat-ripple\r\n          (click)=\"signOut()\">\r\n    Sign Out\r\n  </button>\r\n\r\n  }\r\n  @else {\r\n  <div>\r\n    user (with div)\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  user (without div)\r\n\r\n  <!-- <form> login form </form>-->\r\n  }\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the server side, user is always null, because we do not pass authentication headers to the ssr server.\r\nTherefore, the html from ssr includes the login form\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible for a user to be detected in the browser (localstorage/cookies/indexeddb/firebase/etc).\r\nIn that scenario, the user$ signal is populated, and user info is to be shown, while the login form is to be hidden.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rendered html looks like this\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433443f1-5d75-4af0-b72e-55f3403ba16c)\r\n\r\nPoints to note:\r\n- ✔️ the user info was shown\r\n- ✔️ the \"user without div\" part was hidden\r\n- ❌ the \"user with div part was not hidden\r\n- ❌ the login form was not hidden\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

One, `browser-esbuild`, directly writes to the disk. The two experimental unit test builders also have unique requirements and also directly write. This leaves only the main `application` builder that relies on the internal file writing functionality of `buildApplicationInternal`. To avoid unneeded logic for the other usages (`dev-server`, `extract-i18n`, unit testing, etc.), the disk writing logic is now elevated to the `application` build itself. The internal function will now always provide the output files within the result objects generated from a successful build.

However even when you are using the default 'primary' styling of a select (as documented https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants) the background highlighting of the selected option in the select uses the secondary palette.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10 23 41 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435d9bfb-1856-41f3-a5a6-7839c92d1439)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis is a stackblitz forked from the `mat-select` documentation. It has been adjusted to use custom styles as produced by the output of `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` with the following colors: primary: `ff0000`, secondary: `00ff00`, tertiary: `0000ff`. The generated m3-theme.scss was copied over into that stack blitz and `m3-theme.$light-theme` was then used for `@include mat.all-component-themes(m3-theme.$light-theme)` in `styles.scss`\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/nngoxu-ggvcsg?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click to select element to open up the options list; note the background of the selected element is miscolored\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the selected background color of a given palette to either be static (as in M2's `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)`) or to be based on the colors in the palette chosen to style that component.\r\n\r\nPossible work arounds:\r\n* Use material provided palettes (ie mat.$red-palette). \r\n* Use a secondary color / palette that is produced as a variant the primary color / palette.\r\n* Set the css variable `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color`. \r\n\r\nFor my code I went with option 3; `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);`. Note for option 3, as this is styling something in a `cdk-overlay-container` you have to make sure that your override still applies. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe background color of a 'primary' (default) styled select appears to be using the color as specified in the secondary palette at the '90' level. This 'works' when you use the included scss material palettes because the 'secondary' palette is bundled as a subelement of that palette. A trimmed version of the 'rose' palette (rose/red is one of the styling options on the angular material page), as found in @angular/material/core/themeing/_palettes.scss looks like \r\n\r\n```\r\n/// Rose color palette to be used as primary or tertiary palette.\r\n$rose-palette: _apply-patches((\r\n  0: #000000,\r\n  10: #3f001b,\r\n  <... color levels ...>\r\n  secondary: (\r\n    <... color levels ...>\r\n    90: #ffd9e1, // this is what the selected element actually uses on material.angular.io when using the 'Rose and Red' theme\r\n    <... more color levels>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral: (\r\n    <... color levels...>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral-variant: (\r\n     <... color levels ...>\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n```\r\nSo even for the documentation stylings all of the secondary palettes are mutated forms of the primary palettes and so the selected element's background looks good. When using the `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` no such binding between the primary palette & secondary palette is implied or generated. So when it selects a secondary.90 for styling the background of a primary styled mat-select component it looks wrong.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/select): Material 3 mat-selects use the secondary color for selected item backgrounds (when the component is styled to primary)\" (#29553)"},{"Id":"2450313698","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T16:34:57","Actor":"krzysztofpiotrow","Number":"29545","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(sidenav/drawer/focustrap): over/push mode do not remove tabindex=\"0\" when drawer closed","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using mat-sidenav or mat-drawer with mode over or push (and might need backdrop=true) there is a div element:\r\n`<div class=\"cdk-visually-hidden cdk-focus-trap-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>`\r\nwhich always has tabindex=\"0\" added to it but should get it only when the sidenav/drawer is opened. \r\nAs a result tabbing through the page is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/e4bsuu?file=package.json\r\nStackBlitz was forked from the second example here: [SideNav Examples](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/examples)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

I suppose with MatSelect.\r\n\r\nI have a div that contains a breadcrumb path, which can be scrolled horizontally if it overflows.\r\nAnd I have MatSelect in the path to allow changing directory.\r\n\r\nBut when I'm at the end of the scrolled div (right), I scroll left and click on a MatSelect to change directory, the container jump to the end and do not let me select option...\r\n\r\nSo I supposed it is a bug because I've tried with a simple `select` and I do not have this problem :\r\n\r\nCode to replace in `src/app/components/site-breadcrumb/site-breadcrumb-element/site-breadcrumb-element.component.html` if you want to test with native `select` :\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"breadcrumb-element\">\r\n    <select>\r\n        <option></option>\r\n        <option [value]=\"breadcrumb\" [selected]=\"breadcrumb == selectedBreadcrumb\" *ngFor=\"let breadcrumb of breadcrumbs\">\r\n            {{ breadcrumb.label }}\r\n        </option>\r\n    </select>\r\n</div>\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

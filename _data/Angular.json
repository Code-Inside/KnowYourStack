browser memory leak in our Angular application. It is large enough that it will crash the browser after about 10 minutes of navigating between screens. It is particularly bad on grids. The more rows, the larger the leak. It seems to be triggered by Material attributes like matSort and mat-menu. I have tried the latest version of Edge and Chrome. Please use Edge, since you can see the leak by the Detached Elements tab in DevTools. You can also use More Tools/Browser task manager to monitor the memory and watch it slowly rise as you click back and forth between the links on the page.\r\n\r\nI have provided a small sample application that reproduces the leak.

AbstractControl.status$ Observables","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nAngular forms expose 2 Observables: `valueChanges` and `statusChanges`.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are hot Observables, meaning that if you subscribe after the last change has emitted, you don't receive the value of the control (or its status) until it changes again.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying in case we want to calculate derived states from the form via RxJS.\r\n\r\nInstead of this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.valueChanges.pipe(\r\n  map(({ name, surname }) => name + ' ' + surname)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'd have to introduce `startsWith`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.valueChanges.pipe(\r\n  startsWith(this.form.value),\r\n  map(({ name, surname }) => name + ' ' + surname)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this isn't even enough, because if the subscriber arrives too late (eg. ngIf + async pipe), `startsWith` will return the **initial** value of the control, as I explained [in this article](https://michelestieven.medium.com/angular-derived-values-from-forms-with-rxjs-48760807ed1e?sk=93001042b44c39420848ba2764731f67).\r\n\r\nIn many occasions I suggested something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction valueChanges(control: AbstractControl) {\r\n  return defer(() => of(control.value)).pipe(\r\n    concatWith(control.valueChanges)\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Always reliable\r\nfullName$ = valueChanges(this.form).pipe(map(...));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd same for the status. It's not the end of the world, but it's yet something more that the dev has to add to its cauldron of `utilities.tsx` and remember to use.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think it'd be very convenient to provide 2 more Observables: `value$` and `status$`, which always replay the latest value of the control to the subscribers.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.value$.pipe(map(...));\r\n\r\ncanSubmit$ = this.form.status$.pipe(map(...));\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing getters:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nget fullName() {\r\n  const { name, surname } = this.form.value;\r\n  return name + ' ' + surname;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is not reactive programming and it has several drawbacks, such as:\r\n- Worse performance\r\n- No async flows, debouncing / throttling is hard, no flattening operator capabilities...\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47739","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request for AbstractControl.value$ and AbstractControl.status$ Observables\" (#47739)"},{"Id":"1405195348","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-11T20:34:56","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"47737","RawContent":null,"Title":"Language Service: Automatic Import Improvements","State":"open","Body":"I recently implemented auto-imports in the language service in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47088.

[`v15.0.0-next.6`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1500-next6-2022-10-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/15.0.0-next.5...15.0.0-next.6)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n-   Invalid constructors for DI may now report compilation errors\n\n    When a class inherits its constructor from a base class, the compiler may now\n    report an error when that constructor cannot be used for DI purposes. This may\n    either be because the base class is missing an Angular decorator such as\n    `@Injectable()` or `@Directive()`, or because the constructor contains parameters\n    which do not have an associated token (such as primitive types like `string`).\n    These situations used to behave unexpectedly at runtime, where the class may be\n    constructed without any of its constructor parameters, so this is now reported\n    as an error during compilation.\n\n    Any new errors that may be reported because of this change can be resolved either\n    by decorating the base class from which the constructor is inherited, or by adding\n    an explicit constructor to the class for which the error is reported.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular no longer supports Node.js versions `14.[15-19].x` and `16.[10-12].x`. Current supported versions of Node.js are `14.20.x`, `16.13.x` and `18.10.x`.\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.8 are no longer supported.\n\n##### forms\n\n-   setDisabledState will always be called when a `ControlValueAccessor` is attached. You can opt-out with `FormsModule.withConfig` or `ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig`.\n\n##### router\n\n-   `relativeLinkResolution` is no longer configurable in\n    the Router. This option was used as a means to opt out of a bug fix.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   The `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` token is now deprecated in favor\n    of the `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` token, which accepts an object\n    as a value and the timezone can be defined as a field (called `timezone`)\n    on that object.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RouterLinkWithHref` directive is deprecated, use the `RouterLink` directive instead. The `RouterLink` contains the code from the `RouterLinkWithHref` to handle elements with `href` attributes.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c0c7efaf7c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c0c7efaf7c8a53c1a6f137aac960757cc804f263) | feat | add `provideLocationMocks()` function to provide Location mocks ([#&#8203;47674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47674)) |\n| [75e6297f09](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/75e6297f0901cc98aea1626a138a820e68d026ec) | feat | add <link> preload tag on server for priority img ([#&#8203;47343](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47343)) |\n| [4fde292bb5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4fde292bb58f5d5bc3cf6e634f7cff9eb0d13d84) | feat | Add automatic srcset generation to ngOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;47547](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47547)) |\n| [9483343ebf](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9483343ebf958297ebcb81ef313d356296a41f41) | feat | Add fill mode to NgOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;47738](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47738)) |\n| [bdb5371033](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bdb5371033d8e9a110619861323e8383a32d5900) | feat | add injection token for default DatePipe configuration ([#&#8203;47157](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47157)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [39b72e208b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/39b72e208b46d80f1d9a802cebf043c2ccf3c5f2) | fix | update element schema ([#&#8203;47552](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47552)) |\n| [48b354a83e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/48b354a83e6d94735a03eebb3a52c5698e7a0f44) | fix | update element schema ([#&#8203;47552](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47552)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [38078e7adb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/38078e7adb79c058d2cb1dfe2e8d11f7304d4e5d) | fix | add missing period to error message ([#&#8203;47744](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47744)) |\n| [bc54687c7b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bc54687c7b91efe451aa744d2d3a15ca3524231e) | fix | exclude abstract classes from `strictInjectionParameters` requirement ([#&#8203;44615](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44615)) |\n| [19ad4987f9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/19ad4987f9070222bb2fb8bd07a43ed7995f602a) | fix | use [@&#8203;ts-ignore](https://togithub.com/ts-ignore).

The input is bound to a FormControl instance, so it should be possible to clear the input by simply calling `this.fruitCtrl.setValue(null)` or `this.fruitCtrl.setValue('')`.

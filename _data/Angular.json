The applications will be kept in step with each other in terms of versions. \nMy first attempt at doing this involved having a common library and two applications in the same workspace, but I really want separation of code, I don't want code from one application getting into the other or the common library, I also want to avoid the appearance of that via Visual Studio intellisense\n\nThe second attempt was to have a workspace per app and one for the common library. That worked better as now Visual Studio doesn't show paths from one App in the other. I use \"npm install \"file://...\" to create a link between the two. The version number won't change, it won't be published\n\nThe problem here was that I have to switch off angular caching as otherwise changes in the common library weren't getting built into the application\n\nUltimately I just want a solution that is as simple as what you would do in C#, have 3 standalone projects with explicit references between them\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA solution that would work for me would be a flag that disabled caching for individual npm file link packages, I suspect there are better answers though\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPutting the 2 apps and common code in the same workspace.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n##### 3.27.0 - 22 Oct 2024\n\n-   Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6.

The result of this is that, on the first dirty-check of the table, the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating all the `<th mat-header-cell>` elements and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\nThis phenomenon only occurs on the FIRST click post-column-add, and only if you include the 2nd (sub)header in your table definition, i.e. commenting out `<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>` mitigates the bug.\n\n# Possible root cause of the bug\n\nI think this is happening because Angular somehow rerenders the subheader as a result of dirty-checking the header, but does not update its internal records of the subheader's state in the process. Clicking the button causes the table to re-check its subheader's columns, at which point its differ discovers it hasn't officially added the newest column to the list (although it is already visually displaying the newest column).\n\nThis bug disappears if I modify `CdkTable._renderUpdatedColumns` in the following manner at [angular/components/src/cdk/table/table.ts:1087](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L1087):\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => \n    acc || !!def.getColumnsDiff();\n```\n\nFixed code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => {\n    const diff = def.getColumnsDiff();\n    return acc || !!diff;\n  };\n```\n    \nI think that the lazy computation of `def.getColumnsDiff()` is causing the subheader state not to get updated.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nThere is no exception. The error is that, when the user clicks their first button on a table header, all the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating each `<th mat-header-cell>` element and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"xokrrnnaegq.angular\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.4.0\",\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.6.4\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.8.29\",\n    \"hammerjs\": \"2.0.8\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"angular-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.5.4\",\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^18.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.10.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~7.0.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.8\",\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\n    \"karma\": \"~3.0.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.2\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"protractor\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.11.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.1.1\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers\" (#29922)"},{"Id":"2611853158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T14:52:14","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29920","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): remove unused motion system vars","State":"open","Body":"None of our components use these 36 motion variables and it takes up quite a bit of space in the styles","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29920","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): remove unused motion system vars\" (#29920)"},{"Id":"2610922876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T09:00:28","Actor":"azimuthdeveloper","Number":"29919","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(treeview): Add guide on how to migrate from old treeview to new treeview","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the sudden deprecation of the various tree controllers, it would be nice if there were some kind of documentation on how to remove tree controller and migrate to the new way of doing things.

Initially, I assumed this was a personal issue, but several team members have reported the same experience.\n\nUpon reviewing the CSS code, I found that the backdrop color is [set to a single value](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/5ad133d07341fa8647e81277e7f1b9f54b15059a/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L9), regardless of the theme. Currently, it's a faded black, which works fine for light themes but leads to poor contrast in dark themes. This reduces the legibility of the dialog content, making it harder to distinguish between the page background and the overlay.\n\nIn previous Material 2 theling API, dark themes used a faded white backdrop, which provided better contrast and enhanced readability.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/specs and see that dialog example use a white backdrop on dark mode\n2. Go to https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview, select a dark theme and open dialog in any example\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0043da65-f28c-4cce-bb3a-dcb6bf0cf517)\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d542b0d-fcc4-423d-85a9-02f6cd61f411)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Chrome (latest)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu 24.10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29903","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): low contrast for dialog backdrop in dark theme\" (#29903)"},{"Id":"2602336016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T12:01:04","Actor":"simonkovtyk","Number":"29902","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference","State":"open","Body":"Hi there ...\r\n\r\nRecently, I made some own implementations to support multiple paletts for m3 and I orientated my code at the token generation here.\r\n\r\nI found out, that Angular Material is not using the right tokens for some color rules as described in the [offical Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460).\r\n\r\nHere is an overview:\r\n| Token                    | Hue (Angular Material) | Hue (Material spec)                      |\r\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\r\n| on-primary-container     | Primary 10             | Primary 30                               |\r\n| on-primary-fixed-variant | Primary 30             | Secondary 30 (from primary palette)      |\r\n| on-secondary-container   | Secondary 10           | Secondary 30                             |\r\n| on-tertiary-container    | Tertiary 10            | Tertiary 30                              |","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29902","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference\" (#29902)"},{"Id":"2599961927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T04:21:23","Actor":"K0n4ta13","Number":"29898","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added","State":"open","Body":"I add the README file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29898","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added\" (#29898)"},{"Id":"2598834904","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T16:49:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29897","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): allow optgroup overrides through core-overrides","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that we were supporting overrides for `mat-option` through the `core-overrides` mixin, but not for `mat-optgroup`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29897","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): allow optgroup overrides through core-overrides\" (#29897)"},{"Id":"2598115816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T15:47:26","Actor":"Gopi7a","Number":"29896","RawContent":null,"Title":"standalone missing: stackBlitz example page","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOnce we click the stackBlitz link from the Angular Material page, showing error like  \"error NG2010: 'imports' is only valid on a component that is standalone.\"\nAll the sample code in the stackBlitz missing **standalone: true** in @Component decorator.\n\nChecked version 18+\n\nAngular Material team, need to fix it.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=.gitignore\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

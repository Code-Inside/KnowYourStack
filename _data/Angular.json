Upon building the project, the Angular CLI generates multiple JavaScript files without any reported errors.\r\n\r\nWe are currently facing an issue within our Angular 12 application. Occasionally, the application displays an error indicating that a specific chunk file has not been loaded not for all routes. This problem seems to occur for particular routes, where the corresponding JavaScript file fails to load as expected.\r\n\r\nThe situation raises a question: if a chunk file is failing to load, it might suggest that the file is unavailable on the server. However, it's worth noting that the file does indeed exist on the server. Performing a hard refresh resolves the issue temporarily. However, the inconsistency lies in the fact that after undergoing 6-7 hard refreshes, the solution might work on the 3rd refresh attempt, but the problem resurfaces upon the 4th or 5th refresh.\r\n\r\nDespite conducting extensive research on Google, the prevailing solution for addressing the chunk error seems to be limited to performing a refresh. I'm seeking a more comprehensive and effective resolution to this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 10 23 37 AM (1)](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/53769221/bbc50b1f-1a2b-40bb-affb-a00bf2d3afc8)\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 12.2.6\r\nNode: 14.21.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.18\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.6\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1202.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    12.2.7\r\n@angular/material               12.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             12.2.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.3.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51458","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Encountering a \"chunk error\" when attempting to load a page in an Angular application.\" (#51458)"},{"Id":"1860752854","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-22T07:06:08","Actor":"anhallbe","Number":"51457","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add ability to set URL for ngsw.json at runtime","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nservice-worker\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTL;DR: We cannot serve `ngsw-worker.js` and `ngsw.json` from the same origin, so we'd like a way to configure where `ngsw.json` is fetched from.\r\n\r\nOur setup requires us to serve the application (i.e files produced by `ng build`) from an external CDN. The CDN URL and path cannot be known at build-time, and is set by the server when the index file is rendered (e.g with [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org)). Think:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n// index.html\r\n<script>\r\n  window.APP_CONFIG = {\r\n    cdnUrl: [[${CDN_URL}]]\r\n  };\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script th:src=\"@{${CDN_URL}+'polyfills.js'}\"></script>\r\n<script th:src=\"@{${CDN_URL}+'runtime.js'}\"></script>\r\n<script th:src=\"@{${CDN_URL}+'main.js'}\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to add  `@angular/service-worker` for offline support into the mix, we run into the issue that the `ngsw-worker.js` script cannot be served from the CDN like other files, because of browser restrictions.\r\n\r\nWe *can* work around this by having the `ngsw-worker.js` be served from the page origin. However, we'd still like for the `ngsw.json` manifest to be served together with the rest of the app from the CDN. And this is the issue. There is no way to tell the service worker to fetch the manifest from a different path/url.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd a *runtime* config property that allows to override the default `ngsw.json` path. For example: \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nServiceWorkerModule.register(\"ngsw-worker.js\", {\r\n\t// ...\r\n\tmanifestUrl: `${window.APP_CONFIG.CDN_URL}/ngsw.json`,\r\n}),\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that for our setup, the CDN URL is not known at build-time, so it cannot be a part of `ngsw-config.json`.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAnother possible solution would be something like:\r\n```typescript\r\nServiceWorkerModule.register(\"ngsw-worker.js\", {\r\n\t// ...\r\n\tngswOrigin: \"sw-scope\" | \"import-meta\",\r\n}),\r\n```\r\n...where `\"sw-scope\"` would be default (and the way it works right now), and `\"import-meta\"` would become a URL that is based on where the `main.js` script is loaded from. Possibly based on `import.meta.url`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nOne alternative we tried was to serve `ngsw.json` from the page origin (i.e the same as `ngsw-worker.json`).\r\n\r\nHowever this is not ideal, as the CDN files are deployed more or less independently from the index page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51457","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add ability to set URL for ngsw.json at runtime\" (#51457)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1863987193","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T20:08:06","Actor":"t0m-4","Number":"25706","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular library build watch remove imports","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI have an angular 16 library with a sub entry point that contains a module.\r\n\r\nWhen i use \"ng build my-lib --watch\" --watch\"  it works but if i update a file then the module from my sub entry point is broken.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this :\r\n1.

This would involve creating a built-in mechanism that can analyze the project's file structure and identify files that do not have associated `spec.ts` files. The tool should offer configuration options to customize the file extensions to check, define exclusions, and set exclusion rules based on content.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed solution suggests integrating `jest-angular-test-verifier` directly into Angular CLI, an alternative approach could involve developing a dedicated and more sophisticated solution tailored to Angular projects. By leveraging the power and familiarity of Angular's codebase, the CLI team could create an integrated tool that offers more advanced features and optimizations for detecting missing `spec.ts` files. This approach could lead to a more seamless and tightly integrated experience for Angular developers.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your consideration of this feature proposal and look forward to the possibility of seeing this enhancement added to Angular CLI.

I wanted coverage for my cypress tests but my coverage was thrown off because my source maps were partially compiled (e.g. decorators) so my line numbers were off. See [this issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/21171) for a repro and more details.  I looked at the webpack config that was used to build storybook and noticed that AngularWebpackPlugin had `complierOptions.sourceMap = false` which was overriding my tsconfig which had `sourceMap = true`.  I set `sourceMap = true` in the webpack config at runtime and my source maps worked as expected.  I found the culprit in your source code [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c3c4853d4d908025e2f9f0d32419f11459021bff/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/plugins/typescript.ts#L22C45-L22C45) and was wondering why you are explicitly setting these values and not letting tsconfig be the source of truth?

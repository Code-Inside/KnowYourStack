Instead, it includes a reference to `zone.js` directly in the `angular.json` file, in a `polyfills` array.\r\n\r\nTo set or change settings from `zone.js`, you must add your `zone-flags.ts` in the `polyfills` array, before `zone.js`.\r\n\r\nNew: \r\n\r\n`angular.json`:\r\n```json\r\n\"polyfills\": [\r\n    \"src/zone-flags.ts\",\r\n    \"zone.js\"\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52409","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update zone.md\" (#52409)"},{"Id":"1964491783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-26T22:56:51","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"52408","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update SSR docs","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the `ssr.md` file to restructure (and simplify) SSR docs.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @jessicajaniuk and @dgp1130 .\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52408","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update SSR docs\" (#52408)"},{"Id":"1964334769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-26T20:38:20","Actor":"clydin","Number":"52407","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update esbuild guide for v17","State":"open","Body":"Update new build system guide to reflect stable status and the use of the `application` builder in existing projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52407","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update esbuild guide for v17\" (#52407)"},{"Id":"1964127044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-26T20:21:00","Actor":"zviadadze1","Number":"52404","RawContent":null,"Title":"Create main2","State":"closed","Body":"heh\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

As the pipe manipulates the format, it is forgivable in this case, but one of my main issues with this is that it was very hard to find. My initial impression was that the implementation of the regex in the validator was buggy since the regex worked fine on regex101.com and regexr.com with my test input data, however, the \"error\" was in fact the order in which pipe and validator is run. \r\n\r\nI don't fully understand what you mean by \"Is this a regression\" so I might have answered it incorrectly.\r\n\r\nPlease don't suggest using the currencyPipe, it completely crapped the bed when setting it to SEK and the spaces used in swedish locale for thousand delimiters. The currencyPipe was my initial idea for this but I decided to abandon it because it just didn't work.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52396","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue

JSON schema validator. This can lead to slow build completion (even after the actual build is fully complete) or crashes if the size and/or quantity of output files is large. Architect only requires a `success` property so that is all that will be passed here if the infrastructure settings have not been explicitly set to avoid writes.

Plugging in an arbitrary test runner or configuration can work much more smoothly when a user can build Angular's unit tests to a temporary directory and then execute a unit test runner on top of it. This gives full control over the test runner and its configuration (which may not otherwise integrate with Angular).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThere are three immediately obvious ways of doing this with various trade offs:\r\n\r\n1. `ng build --tests` - This would update the `build` target target (`browser` or `application`) to support building tests for an application. Unfortunately this builder doesn't actually know which tests you're trying to include or what additional test options you might have (test polyfills for example like `zone.js/testing`). Including test-specific concerns into the build target would break the abstraction it tries to provide (`application` builds an _application_, not tests).\r\n\r\n2. `ng test --build-only` - This is similar to the first, but shifts the responsibility to the test builder, which has a little more context about test options. It would need to support a user-specified `outputPath`. We could definitely expose that, though `ng test --build-only` comes dangerously close to what I call `ng test --dont`, where an option basically invalidates the point of the command and I'd very much like to avoid that.\r\n\r\n3. `ng run build-tests` - This approach separate building an application, building tests, and running tests in distinct builders like:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"my-app\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        // Builds the application itself.\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        // Builds tests of the application.\r\n        \"build-tests\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:build-tests\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"buildTarget\": \"my-app:build\",\r\n            \"include\": [\"**/*.ts\"],\r\n            // Build options specific to tests...\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        \"test\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:jest\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"buildTestsTarget\": \"my-app:build-tests\",\r\n            // Jest options...\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis nicely separates the build, build for test, and test actions, meaning they can be run independently. `ng test` could build and test the application, while `ng run build-tests` would only perform the build step.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate part of this is that it gets quite verbose and Architect is not well set up today to compose other builders in an easy way. Also `build-tests` doesn't _really_ wrap `build` in this way, as it needs to modify the work done by the `build` target in a really awkward way which can lead to a lot of nuance.\r\n\r\nCurrently the exact shape of the built output for tests is an internal implementation detail, while this feature necessitates making that effectively public API. We'd need to figure out the exact contract of what this directory actually contains and how test tools should leverage it. For example, Jest needs to load polyfills in a very specific way so they are applied inside the VM for each test and we would need to make sure approaches like that are supported.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n1.  Integrate with every notable test runner (hard to scale).\r\n2.  Expose hooks for the build/test process for every supported test runner (hard to be flexible and opinionated at the same time).\r\n3.  Build Angular application components like a library, defer the test compilation to another tool.\r\n    \r\n    Arguably `build-tests` shouldn't even build the `**.spec.ts` files, but rather build application components like a library which can be imported by a test compilation. We've talked about potentially replacing `ng-packagr` with a new `library` builder (congruent with the `application` builder). If this was somewhat decoupled from the APF format (which isn't needed for tests) we could potentially use that as the `build-tests` target. This could build all the `**.spec.ts` files, or potentially just build the `**.ts` files (with `main.ts` excluded). A separate compilation (whether also using this `library` builder or just calling `tsc` directly) could build the actual `**.spec.ts` files with a dependency on the pre-built `**.ts` files.\r\n    \r\n    This is actually how things are done inside Google, but we have a pretty comprehensive build system in Bazel to make that scale effectively. In an Angular CLI context, I expect this is probably being way too specific and nuanced with the build process to be useful. As much as _I_ want things to work this way, I get that most users probably don't and it likely isn't worth the configuration and complexity cost.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26132","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Build unit tests specifically\" (#26132)"},{"Id":"1962168351","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T20:37:09","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"26131","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26131","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#26131)"},{"Id":"1961953048","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T20:20:40","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"26130","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26130","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#26130)"},{"Id":"1961872190","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T17:56:38","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"26127","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v16.2.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"16.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26127","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v16.2.8 release\" (#26127)"},{"Id":"1961800922","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T17:09:02","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"26126","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.2.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26126","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.2.8\" with changelog.\" (#26126)"},{"Id":"1960649041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T06:34:53","Actor":"I-A-S","Number":"26125","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add custom postcss plugin support","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It was done by inspecting the whole source span\r\nthen figuring out the relative position of the cursor.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we introduce a flag to set the binding span as the\r\nsource span of the `ParsedProperty` in Ivy AST.\r\nThis flag is needed so that we don't have to change VE ASTs.\r\n\r\nNote that in the binding parser, we already set `bindingSpan` as the\r\nsource span for a `ParsedVariable`, and `keySpan` as the source span for\r\na literal attribute. This change makes the Ivy AST more consistent by\r\npropagating the binding span to `ParsedProperty` as well.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

To demonstrate this in a simple case, the minimal reproduction has a component that throws an error from inside the constructor. We have another component that links to the error prone one and has runGuardsAndResolvers set to 'always'. Finally, we have a listener in the main app component that listens for NavigationError events and redirects to the non-error component (in reality this would be a special error page).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you click the link to the error component it starts activating the router outlet but fails before it is fully activated. This triggers a NavigationError which is expected. But when navigating to the non-error component, it fails saying \"Outlet is not activated\". This is triggered by the [getRouterGuards](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/utils/preactivation.ts#L125) method inside preactivation.ts. In order to trigger this use case, you need to ensure that guards and resolvers are run on this navigation which is why runGuardsAndResolvers needs to be set to 'always'.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> [https://stackblitz.com/edit/error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad?file=src/app/app.component.ts](https://stackblitz.com/edit/error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad?file=src/app/app.component.ts)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nError: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Outlet is not activated\r\nError: Outlet is not activated\r\nat RouterOutlet.get [as component] (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:5119:27)\r\nat getRouteGuards (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:3005:77)\r\nat eval (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:2968:13)\r\nat Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\nat getChildRouteGuards (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:2967:29)\r\nat getAllRouteGuards (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:2937:16)\r\nat MapSubscriber.eval [as project] (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/@angular/router@8.0.0/bundles/router.umd.js:3999:84)\r\nat MapSubscriber._next (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/rxjs@6.5.2/internal/operators/map.js:49:35)\r\nat MapSubscriber.Subscriber.next (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/rxjs@6.5.2/internal/Subscriber.js:66:18)\r\nat TapSubscriber._next (https://error-during-outlet-activation-uqvsad.stackblitz.io/turbo_modules/rxjs@6.5.2/internal/operators/tap.js:65:26)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n8.0.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Manual import can be considered as workaround but a think that command `localize-translate` should inject bare locale info object there translated template plural forms can be placed and used by angular runtime.\r\nThe bundle build process involve webpack and AngularCompilerPlugin.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.0\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1001.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core         10.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   10.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack             10.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular          10.1.0\r\n@schematics/update           0.1001.0\r\nrxjs                         6.6.2\r\ntypescript                   3.9.7\r\nwebpack                      4.44.1\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Most are GET request but some are POST request.\r\nThe problem I'm facing is that when making the POST request, sometimes the request success but much times do not.\r\nUpon examining the client Headers I see that the X-XSRF-TOKEN header value differs from the XSRF-TOKEN cookie value.\r\nIn the request history I can see that each request is sending the same XSR-TOKEN cookie and the server responds with a new XSR-TOKEN but looks like the browser cookie is not updated as soon as the cookie is returned.\r\nAt some point in the request history, the browser cookie is updated with one of the new server returned cookies.\r\nSubsequent endpoint request send this new Cookie but, if the request is a POST, keeps sending the old X-XSRF-TOKEN value (from old/inital cookie value) so the server responses with a 403.  Expected as the XSR-TOKEN cookie value differs from the X-XSR-TOKEN value.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can understand, the problem is that:\r\n\r\n- For any API call, the server returns a new XSR-TOKEN cookie (as no session ever exists)\r\n- When the browser receives a new cookie value from the server, the update of the cookie may be not processed right the way (has it a processing loop in other thread or something?)\r\n- HttpClientXsrfModule keeps using \"his last known\" value for the cookie to set the X-XSRF-TOKEN header before making new requests\r\n- Eventually the browser updates the value of the XSR-TOKEN cookie with the last value received from the server\r\n- HttpClientXsrfModule does not know this update has been done and keeps using \"his last known\" value for the cookie (but the browser sends the new cookie value to the server)\r\n- The request is received by the server that checks the value from the XSR-TOKEN cookie and the X-XSRF-TOKEN header.  As the do not match, a 403 is returned\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Sorry, I don't know how to setup a REST API on stackblitz.com that requires XSRF with cookie token repository\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nInvalid CSRF token found\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.2\r\nNode: 12.18.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.29\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

But it is very problematic in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. The external state is not the same as the internal state. For example editors like Quill or Slate maintain an internal object structure for their state. When you want to write a markdown editor you have to convert the state to markdown with every change, which is expensive. Other editors like TinyMCE are based on the DOM, so you have to convert the DOM to HTML with every change which is also expensive.\r\n\r\n2. The editor itself does not provide a reliable way to get all changes. It could be a bug, but sometimes it is just a feature, for example when plugins make a silent change in Quill.\r\n\r\n3. You can miss changes. For example when you update the form state on blur only to improve performance and then press a submit button, you do not have the latest changes available, because the form has no way to force an update of all values.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to change the signature to this\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ControlValueAccessor {\r\n  registerOnChange(fn: () => void): void;\r\n\r\n  getValue(): any;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows different approaches, for example:\r\n\r\n1. You can call `getValue()` in your change callback to update your model on every change.\r\n2. You can call `getValue()` in your blur callback to update your model on every focus lost.\r\n3. You can convert your change callback to an observable and then use `debounceTime` operator to improve performance.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For backwards compatibility we can either make `getValue()` optional or introduce a `ControlValueAccessor2`.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy build a wrapper of `ControlValueAccessor2` around `ControlValueAccessor1` in angular itself, e.g.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI have not found a good workaround.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39014","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Separate change callback with reading value\" (#39014)"},{"Id":"709622888","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-26T22:18:22","Actor":"vanthome","Number":"39013","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): add ng-vcl","State":"open","Body":"Just an aio page add of the NG-VCL components library.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39013","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs-infra): add ng-vcl\" (#39013)"},{"Id":"709616377","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-26T21:46:08","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"39012","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(forms): introduce min and max validators","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It looks like it is related to the refactoring to get ready for TS 4 (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21?branch=a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21&diff=unified#diff-b2c222e0f78a5c4cf888115c56457e2dR87).  \r\n\r\nIn particular a change to this line: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blame/a85ba990eb9482e630ba78b6b8417edeb1499b21/packages/angular_devkit/architect_cli/bin/architect.ts#L87\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nWhen running a serve target through the architect cli, it results in a schema validation error \"Data path \"\" should NOT have additional properties(_).\"\r\n\r\nTracing through the code, it looks like the validation error was caused by the build options schema.  \r\n\r\nIt looks like minimalist npm library introduces an extra _ property when parsing args and those args are passed directly as build options for the serve target.  In the refactor commit mentioned above, it looks like the code changed from `delete argv['_']` to `argv['_']=[]`, this looks to be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nI did try reverting the line back to delete and the serve worked as expected.   This could affect other targets, it just manifested under the serve target for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include:

However, `nx` doesn't have an `nx add` command, only an `nx generate` command.

At the moment, you can only run `ng add @angular/material` if you chose angular instead of `nx` as your CLI. If you choose `nx` as your CLI, then it generates a `workspace.json` instead of an `angular.json`. You can kind of get around this by moving `workspace.json` to `angular.json`, installing the angular CLI, and then running the `ng add` command, but it would be nice if there was first-class support for usage in an `nx` mono-repo using the `nx` CLI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20675","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(schematics): allow for using @nrwl/nx generate on @angular/material add schematic\" (#20675)"},{"Id":"710604744","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-28T21:54:29","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"20674","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: update chagelog","State":"open","Body":"add changelog from 10.2.1 to 10.2.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20674","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"release: update chagelog\" (#20674)"},{"Id":"710553094","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-28T21:06:47","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"20673","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 10.2.3 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20673","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 10.2.3 w/ changelog\" (#20673)"},{"Id":"710544652","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-28T20:10:03","Actor":"bochalito","Number":"20672","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/a11y): cdkAriaLive default to 'polite'","State":"open","Body":"Currently if a cdkAriaLive does not have an `Input` specified defaults\r\nto `off` value.

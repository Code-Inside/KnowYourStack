Rather, we need to declare the form in the component and separately instantiate it after the constructor has run, usually in the ngOnInit hook.\r\n\r\nSeparating the declaration steps from the initialization step can lead to the two types misaligning, which causes an error like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }>' is not assignable to type 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }>'.\r\n  Types of property 'controls' are incompatible.\r\n    Type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }' is not assignable to type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-4ld5bn?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\nThis is a small example, but already it gets hard to parse. The issue is that one of the form controls wasn’t marked as nonNullable during initialization, and `FormControl<string|null>` is not assignable to `FormControl<string>`. Now imagine you have a Form with multiple levels of nested FormArrays and FormGroups and one control is out of sync with its declaration. It is a nightmare to debug.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhen a FormGroup instance is not assignable to a variable of FormType, the error message should indicate the paths of the offending control(s) in both the instantiated and declared types. This could be done similarly to how TypeScript handles incompatible structured types:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype Declaration = {\r\n    a: string\r\n    b: {\r\n        b1: string\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Instantiation = {\r\n    a: string\r\n    b: {\r\n        b1: string | null\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet decl: Declaration\r\nlet inst!: Instantiation\r\n\r\ndecl = inst\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'Instantiation' is not assignable to type 'Declaration'.\r\n  The types of 'b.b1' are incompatible between these types.\r\n    Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string'.\r\n      Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n[TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/C4TwDgpgBAIhDGAbAhgJ2cAlgewHZQF4oBvAWACgoqpkAuKAZ2FU1wHMLqoAjesyrtW4BGekxbtO1AL4VZ5CqEhQAkribJcWDDnxF+XOo2asOAqrxJTBPUcYlsoAHyi4ArokTWo8+RUQQwFAAJgiI9HBIaDp4-oFQrEwAhPRqGlqYMbgUFKFIhAnqwEA)\r\n\r\nI say “in both the instantiated and declared types” to catch the case where one type has more form controls than the other – this case is handled by this error message in TS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'b' is missing in type 'Instantiation' but required in type 'Declaration'.(2741)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen two form controls differ in type, then the error message should unwrap the types of the controls and explain why they’re not assignable. In the example above, this might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }>' is not assignable to type 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }>'.\r\n  Types of property 'controls' are incompatible.\r\n    Type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }' is not assignable to type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }'.\r\n       The types of 'c' are incompatible between these types.\r\n         Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string'.\r\n           Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56864","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve the type error message for unassignable form groups\" (#56864)"},{"Id":"2392057664","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T07:53:10","Actor":"Undestor","Number":"56863","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template of fixture is not updated using signals (in test)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn the following test scenario:\r\n```\r\ndescribe('Test with input', () => {\r\n\t@Component({\r\n\t\tstandalone: true,\r\n\t\ttemplate: `{{ htmlData }}`,\r\n\t\tchangeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n\t})\r\n\tclass TestComponentWithInput {\r\n\t\tdata = input<string>()\r\n\t\thtmlData?: string\r\n\t\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\t\teffect(() => {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.htmlData = this.data()\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tit('#1 should have \"foobar\" in template', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithInput)\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges() // <---- This is necessary\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n\r\n\tit('#2 should have \"foobar\" in template', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithInput)\r\n\t\t//fixture.detectChanges() // <---- Template is not updated because of missing detectChanges\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n})\r\n```\r\nOnly test no. 1 does work and test no. 2 will fail. Apparently the `fixture.detectChanges()` before setting the input is needed. Otherwise the template does not get updated (See test no. 2).\\\r\nIs this the correct behaviour or is this a bug?\r\nIf this is the expected behaviour, how can i test a required signal input, like in the following scenario:\r\n```\r\ndescribe('Test with required input', () => {\r\n\t@Component({\r\n\t\tstandalone: true,\r\n\t\ttemplate: `{{ htmlData }}`,\r\n\t\tchangeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n\t})\r\n\tclass TestComponentWithRequiredInput {\r\n\t\tdata = input.required<string>()\r\n\t\thtmlData?: string\r\n\t\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\t\teffect(() => {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.htmlData = this.data()\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tit('#1 should have \"foobar\" in template', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithRequiredInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithRequiredInput)\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges() // <---- This is necessary but throws error\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n\r\n\tit('#2 should have \"foobar\" in template (but i am broken)', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithRequiredInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithRequiredInput)\r\n\t\t//fixture.detectChanges() // <---- Template is not updated because of missing detectChanges\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n})\r\n```\r\nIn this scenario both of the tests will fail. The test no. 1 fails (and throws an the error `NG0950: Input is required but no value is available yet`) because i need to set the input before using `fixture.detectChanges()` and the test no. 2 does fail because i have not used `fixture.detectChanges` before setting the input and therefore the template is not updated.\\\r\n\r\nI hope i was able to describe my dilemma :)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.4\r\nNode: 20.12.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.3.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.3\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.4\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.4\r\nng-packagr                      18.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.4\r\nwebpack                         5.92.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56863","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Template of fixture is not updated using signals (in test)\" (#56863)"},{"Id":"2391785174","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T04:38:25","Actor":"ashishnd","Number":"56861","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(forms): fix broken link to Forms package in API reference","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The official Angular documentation explains how to assign a nonce to `CSP_NONCE` during the bootstrapping phase, but I need guidance on how to update it dynamically for every request. If the `CSP_NONCE` is not updated with each request, the scripts will be blocked by the browser because the nonce in the response header will not match the current `CSP_NONCE` value.\r\n\r\nAny advice or examples on how to achieve this dynamic update would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/best-practices/security#content-security-policy\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nhttps://angular.dev/best-practices/security#content-security-policy\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nThere is no way given to update CSP_NONCE value dynamically on each api request.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56854","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Update CSP_NONCE value dynamically on each API request using angular 16\" (#56854)"},{"Id":"2391293151","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-04T17:59:33","Actor":"fredsa","Number":"56853","RawContent":null,"Title":"Non-existent pages return `200`, but should return `404` http status","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nNon-existent pages, e.g. https://angular.dev/this-page-does-not-exist, are expected to return `404` http status.

Specifically, our builder adds plugins to webpack for handling fonts and SVGs from assets, which are subsequently included in indexHtml, along with additional scripts.\r\n\r\nI attempted to use a `buildApplicationInternal` equivalent for esbuild, but I encountered difficulties retrieving fonts and SVG information in the `onEnd` callbacks to use later in `indexHtmlTransformer` - not all information about media files is returned in metafile.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for guidance on the best approach to take when working with esbuild, considering the need to maintain our existing logic.\r\nIs it save to use `buildApplicationInternal` in the future?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried to run the project with ng serve. However, instead of launching Vite, webpack is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis might be because `ng serve `uses the `isEsbuildBased` function for verification, which only checks:\r\n```\r\nfunction isEsbuildBased(builderName) {\r\n    if (builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:application' ||\r\n        builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild') {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni have my custom builder name there.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something here, but there is no documentation for these cases.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0)\n\n***This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.*** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.22.0` or `~0.22.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Revert the recent change to avoid bundling dependencies for node ([#&#8203;3819](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3819))\n\n    This release reverts the recent change in version 0.22.0 that made `--packages=external` the default behavior with `--platform=node`.  The default is now back to `--packages=bundle`.\n\n    I've just been made aware that Amazon doesn't pin their dependencies in their \"AWS CDK\" product, which means that whenever esbuild publishes a new release, many people (potentially everyone?) using their SDK around the world instantly starts using it without Amazon checking that it works first. This change in version 0.22.0 happened to break their SDK. I'm amazed that things haven't broken before this point. This revert attempts to avoid these problems for Amazon's customers. Hopefully Amazon will pin their dependencies in the future.\n\n    In addition, this is probably a sign that esbuild is used widely enough that it now needs to switch to a more complicated release model. I may have esbuild use a beta channel model for further development.\n\n-   Fix preserving collapsed JSX whitespace ([#&#8203;3818](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3818))\n\n    When transformed, certain whitespace inside JSX elements is ignored completely if it collapses to an empty string. However, the whitespace should only be ignored if the JSX is being transformed, not if it's being preserved. This release fixes a bug where esbuild was previously incorrectly ignoring collapsed whitespace with `--jsx=preserve`. Here is an example:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>\n\n    // Old output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo><Bar /></Foo>;\n\n    // New output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>;\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.3`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small533-2024-07-03-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.3.2...v5.3.3)\n\n-   fix: lazily evaluate \\__vite\\_\\_mapDeps files ([#&#8203;17602](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17602)) ([dafff4a](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/dafff4a)), closes [#&#8203;17602](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17602)\n-   fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;17590](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17590)) ([012490c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/012490c)), closes [#&#8203;17590](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17590)\n-   fix(lib): remove pure CSS dynamic import ([#&#8203;17601](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17601)) ([055f1c1](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/055f1c1)), closes [#&#8203;17601](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17601)\n-   fix(proxy): replace changeOrigin changes in 5.3.0 with new rewriteWsOrigin option ([#&#8203;17563](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17563)) ([14c3d49](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/14c3d49)), closes [#&#8203;17563](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17563)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The behavior follows the WebAssembly/ES module integration proposal. The usage of this feature requires the ability to use native async/await and top-level await. Due to this requirement, applications must be zoneless to use this new feature. Applications that use Zone.js are currently incompatible and an error will be generated if the feature is used in a Zone.js application. Manual setup of a WASM file is, however, possible in a Zone.js application if WASM usage is required. Further details for manual setup can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Loading_and_running\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief example of using a WASM file in the new feature with the integration proposal behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport { multiply } from './example.wasm';\r\n\r\nconsole.log(multiply(4, 5));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: TypeScript will not automatically understand the types for WASM files. Type definition files will need to be created for each WASM file to allow for an error-free build.

For example, if you change the code to do `this.currentFruit.set('apple')` and reproduce this bug again, only the Apple element will be displayed when clicking a second time on the autocomplete (despite having only 'a' displayed)_ \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input should reflect the signal state correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input is not updated according to the signal state.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, probably?

you can no longer scroll the page. Behavior seems similarly broken with some but not all other similar components.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that it doesn't work on the current Material Examples page, but it does work on the stackblitzes connected to them.\r\n\r\nI have a similar problem in my own repo, but could not really reproduce it in the stackblitz. I do see that they all have the reposition scrollstrategy and I've tried it with the noop one too but it just doesn't seem to work properly.\r\n\r\nI've only recently migrated to 18, but 17 also has the issue present as that is our current production version.\r\n\r\nI don't have a workaround yet either. Setting the Scroll Strategy doesn't work and when you remove the pointer-events you can no longer close the dropdown. Behavior seems fine with MatAutocomplete examples, but also broken with MatMenu on examples page.

They give full control over theming:\r\n* Theme variable values are available at runtime.\r\n* Theme variable values can be adjusted at runtime.\r\n* Changing the entire theme is just a matter of supplying different values for the `sys-` variables.\r\n* Using any theme variable anywhere in the app can be done using the CSS variables. No need for importing any SASS logic from `@angular/material`.\r\n\r\nDefining and using a theme is as simple as:\r\n```scss\r\n@use \"@angular/material\" as mat;\r\n\r\n$theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n  (\r\n    color: (\r\n      theme-type: light,\r\n      primary: mat.$cyan-palette,\r\n      tertiary: mat.$magenta-palette,\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n    typography: (\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this one can easily define a bunch of such defined themes, and then load one based on user settings. Alternatively a backend endpoint could render the CSS file with the `sys-` variables.\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\nEverything in Angular Material nicely supports system-level themes, except the component theming mixins. \r\nWe still are still required to do something like:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n    @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not nice, because we now have generic styling code that needs to use a specific theme. \r\n\r\nA solution would be to allow passing something like this:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes((use-system-variables: true));\r\n  // Or available on mat.\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes(mat.$system-variables-theme);\r\n  // Or allow passing no theme\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nCreate your own `$system-variables-theme`, and use it:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  $system-variables-theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n    (\r\n      color: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n      typography: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($system-variables-theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nEasy and clean theming, with minimal theme files.\r\nI'm not sure whether the current workaround is 'ergonomic' enough.

The current recommended way of theming components requires writing a dedicated file with at least three mixins: `theme`, `color`, and `typography` (and `density`?). While this approach follows a good philosophy of separating concerns, it has some significant drawbacks:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Exponential Growth and Difficult Maintenance\r\n\r\nIn large projects with hundreds of components, having a separate theme for each component can become boilerplate-heavy and lead to tedious maintenance. For example, the [material.angular.io app theme](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io/blob/main/src/_app-theme.scss) imports and uses all themes scattered across the app. Scaling this approach to a much larger project would be painful and error-prone. The component-attached stylesheet is no longer the single source of truth.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Excessive Boilerplate\r\n\r\nCreating a new component requires writing a dedicated theme that we have to import and use in `styles.scss`. This adds unnecessary complexity to the development process.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Lack of Component View Encapsulation\r\n\r\nOne of Angular's cool features is view encapsulation, which prevents style collisions. However, since themes need to be applied in the main `styles.scss` file, encapsulation cannot be used. This forces us to rely on verbose CSS class names (e.g., `app-my-component-header-title`), whereas a simpler `header-title` would suffice when wrapped in an encapsulated stylesheet.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Dependence on SASS\r\n\r\nTo customize Angular Material, you have to use SASS, but some developers might prefer not to rely on it for various reasons. Additionally, `ng new` offers different stylesheet formats, which means forcing SASS can be limiting.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Alternative\r\n\r\nInspired by the new Material 3 `use-system-variables` capability, I propose using a set of CSS variables (e.g., `--sys-primary`, `--sys-body-large`, etc.) available globally for Angular Material and custom components, instead of relying on SASS mixins. Of course, we could consider having a schematics to help developer to generate those variables just like `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` does.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto listed those variables in [this comment](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29104#issuecomment-2126365863)\r\n\r\nAlso, using css variables only instead of SASS theme simplify overrides and remove the need of Angular components mixins (like `mat.button-theme($my-theme)`).\r\n\r\nHowever, I can understand we still need to import core styles. This could be easily addressed by registering the right css file in `angular.json` file in build `styles` option list.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n  \"src/styles.css\",\r\n  \"path/to/angular-material-component-core.css\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problems to Consider\r\n\r\n#### 1. Conditional Logic Based on Theme Type (Dark or Light)\r\n\r\nWe have to find a css alernative to `get-theme-type($theme)`.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\ncolor: if(mat.get-theme-type($theme) == dark, white, black);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNative CSS does not provide an `if` conditional operator, but the CSS `container` property could be a viable alternative (cf. https://stackoverflow.com/a/76327443).\r\n\r\n#### 2. Reading Palettes' Hues\r\n\r\nWithout SASS, palettes will not be available. However, this issue could be mitigated by adding more CSS variables (e.g., `--sys-primary-80`, `--sys-secondary-20`).\r\n\r\n### To sumarize\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to streamline the theming process in Angular Material by reducing boilerplate, enhancing maintainability, and leveraging modern CSS capabilities. It aligns with the broader trend of using CSS variables for theming and can simplify the theming experience for developers.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature request. I believe it can significantly improve the development workflow and theming consistency in Angular Material projects.\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe could replace the following code :\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// styles.scss\r\n\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n\r\n$my-theme: mat.define-theme((\r\n color: (\r\n    theme-type: light,\r\n    primary: mat.$violet-palette,\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// carousel.scss\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: 50%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel-button {\r\n    // Read the 50 hue from the primary color palette.\r\n    color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 50);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel {\r\n    // Get the large headline font from the theme.\r\n    font: mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-large, font);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin theme($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, color) {\r\n    @include color($theme);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, typography) {\r\n    @include typography($theme);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nby this lighter code in pure css : \r\n\r\n```css\r\n// styles.css\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  --sys-primary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-secondary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-tertiary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-error: #xxxxxx;\r\n  // and so on...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// carousel.css\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  font: var(--sys-headline-large);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: 50%;\r\n  color: var(--sys-primary-50);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// no more need for _carousel-theme.scss\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29363","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theming): Replace SASS-Based theming with global CSS variables \" (#29363)"},{"Id":"2384828859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-01T22:22:16","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"29361","RawContent":null,"Title":"POC: zoneless support via await until condition in harnesses","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29361","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"POC: zoneless support via await until condition in harnesses\" (#29361)"},{"Id":"2384016382","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-01T14:31:38","Actor":"SebastianPodgajny","Number":"29358","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(drag-drop): Failed to execute insertBefore on Node","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen drag and drop is used and data refreshes in background this error can be thrown\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/a9tq3w?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

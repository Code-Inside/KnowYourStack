There are a couple issues:\r\n\r\n* Clicking on a public field does not scroll to the detailed explanation of the item. It looks like the scroll starts but is aborted almost immediately\r\n* On mobile, the header interferes with the scroll position. I believe the ViewportScroller offset needs to be set correctly (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/viewport_scroller.ts#L38)\r\n* On mobile, after scrolling to a specific detailed view of an item, trying to scroll back up through the list of items is frustrating. There seems to be some \"snap\" behavior that attempts to snap the cards to the top but this feels pretty unhelpful\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/router/Router\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55131","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Scrolling on angular.dev API reference page is not working well\" (#55131)"},{"Id":"2216135345","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-30T02:06:00","Actor":"9kubczas4","Number":"55133","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): scrolling experience in API Reference","State":"closed","Body":"Fix scrolling experience in API Reference:\r\n- set correct margin top for members container (right side) which is aligned with tabs (left side)\r\n- prevent scroll on focus\r\n- remove redundant blur calls\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

All globs should work the same between `src` and `watch` now!\n-   Removed support for ordered globs. This aligns with the chokidar globbing implementation. If you need your globs to be ordered, you can use `ordered-read-stream`\n-   All globs and paths are normalized to unix-like filepaths\n-   Only allow JS variants for `.gulp.*` config files\n-   Removed support for alpha releases of v4 from `gulp-cli`\n-   Removed the `--verify` flag\n-   Renamed the `--require` flag to `--preload` to avoid conflicting with Node.js flags\n-   Removed many legacy and deprecated loaders\n-   Upgrade to chokidar v3\n-   Clone `Vinyl` objects with stream contents using `teex`, but no longer wait for all streams to flow before cloned streams will receive data\n-   Stop using `process.umask()` to make directories, instead falling back to Node's default mode\n-   Throw on non-function, non-string option coercers\n-   Drop support of Node.js snake_case flags\n-   Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` namespace to the store\n-   Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` store to the global\n-   Use sha256 to hash the `v8flags` cache into a filename\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Streamlined the dependency tree\n-   Switch all streams implementation to Streamx\n-   Rewrote `glob-stream` to use a custom directory walk that relies on newer Node.js features and is more performant than old implementation\n-   Implement translation support for all CLI messages and all messages passing through gulplog\n-   Allow users to customize or remove the timestamp from their logs\n-   Upgraded gulplog to v2. Messages logged via v1 will also display a deprecated warning.

Using the new application builder I was using vite's way to import a worker which was through\r\n```\r\nimport MapboxGLWorker from \"mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl-csp-worker?worker\";\r\nworkerClass: MapboxGLWorker\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works but only when using the development server (ng serve). Building the application with `ng build` or when serving with the `--prebundle=false` argument results in a `main.ts:5 ERROR TypeError: ug.workerClass is not a constructor` error in the browser\r\n\r\nI then came accross [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27323) which was similar so I tried the `new Worker()` method which still results in the same error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

documentation","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nToday I struggled about mat-chips being focusable and wanted to make them unfocusable (but not disabled). I thought there was no `tabindex` until I found this comment which obiously said you can acces it through `[tabIndex]` https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20883#issuecomment-744759846.\r\n\r\nNow the first question: is it expected to have no mentions of the `tabIndex` in the documentation? Because there is already the `id` and `value` inputs for example and I believe the `tabIndex` could be there too. Also apprently I'm not the only one on the internet struggling knowing it exists. I think it could be a good addition to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you think it makes totally sense 🎉I'm super motivated to update the repository to see them. I already checked in the source code that all these components have a tabindex input:\r\n* button\r\n* checkbox\r\n* chips\r\n* datepicker\r\n* expansion-panel\r\n* radio\r\n* select\r\n* slide-toggle\r\n* tab\r\n* tree\r\nI also have the feeling that the documentation uses the comments from [angular/component](https://github.com/angular/component) and is generated in [angular/material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io). So I have the feeling I only need to update angular/component. As far as I understand there is already comments above the `tabIndex` input so it should be visible in the documentation. \r\n\r\nIf angular/component seems OK I was wondering maybe in angular/material.angular.io there is some filtering that ignores `tabIndex` but no mentions at all about `tabIndex` so I have the feeling that our problem doesn't lay there.\r\n\r\nLast point, in the API Report File for \"components-srcs\" I can see some attributes with `// (undocumented)` comment above. These attributes aren't visible in the documentation. But still, the `tabIndex` don't have this kind of comment above.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to fix this problem myself but it would be nice if someone could give me some hints on where to look. It would save me some time :)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttp://localhost:4200/components/chips/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Tabindex is missing in the documentation\" (#28793)"},{"Id":"2213590003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T16:01:06","Actor":"XavierDupessey","Number":"28792","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/drag-drop): DRAG AND DROP SELECTING TEXT WITH SHADOW DOM ENCAPSULATION ON FIREFOX","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with Drag and Drop examples from https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview when a parent component is encapsulated with Shadow DOM **on Firefox**: it selects text of other elements (cf video).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/1449888/2273a28d-637c-4a55-bb85-bfcfed87119c\r\n\r\nI tested it with the \"Drag&Drop connected sorting\" example from version 14 to 17.\r\nThe bug exists in all versions (I did not try older versions).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nXavier\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link (under v14): https://stackblitz.com/edit/gszzna?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

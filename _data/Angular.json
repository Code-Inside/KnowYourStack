However, each example type has a different `package.json`, which comes from `aio/tools/examples/shared/boilerplate/*`). In order to ensure that the dependencies in each examples `package.json` are the same as the ones in the symlinked `node_modules/` (i.e. the ones that CI tests are run with), we have a script (`yarn run sync deps`) that can sync dependencies from `shared/package.json` into the boilerplate `package.json` files.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this script had to be run manually, which was easy to forget/not know about. This resulted in the boilerplate dependencies often being out-of-sync with the ones in `shared/package.json` and by extension the ones that were actually installed in `node_modules/`.\r\n\r\nThis commit helps keep the boilerplate dependencies up-to-date in the following ways:\r\n- Adds the `sync-deps` script to the `postinstall` scripts to ensure dependencies will remain in sync whenever someone manually updates dependencies in `shared/package.json`.\r\n- Runs the `sync-deps` script as a Renovate post-upgrade task to ensure that the depenencies will remain in sync whenever Renovate updates dependencies in `shared/package.json`.\r\n  For more info on configuring post-upgrade tasks in Renovate, see:\r\n  - [postUpgradeTasks][1]\r\n  - [allowedPostUpgradeCommands][2]\r\n  - [allowPostUpgradeCommandTemplating][3]\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nFor the Renovate change to take effect, the [global config][4] in `angular/dev-infra` also needs to be updated.

Hopefully everything is working after this release. I plan to change all platform-specific package names to use the `@esbuild/` scope at some point to avoid this problem in the future.\n\n### [`v0.14.52`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01452)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.51...v0.14.52)\n\n-   Allow binary data as input to the JS `transform` and `build` APIs ([#&#8203;2424](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2424))\n\n    Previously esbuild's `transform` and `build` APIs could only take a string. However, some people want to use esbuild to convert binary data to base64 text. This is problematic because JavaScript strings represent UTF-16 text and esbuild internally operates on arrays of bytes, so all strings coming from JavaScript undergo UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion before use. This meant that using esbuild in this way was doing base64 encoding of the UTF-8 encoding of the text, which was undesired.\n\n    With this release, esbuild now accepts `Uint8Array` in addition to string as an input format for the `transform` and `build` APIs. Now you can use esbuild to convert binary data to base64 text:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import esbuild from 'esbuild'\n    console.log([\n      (await esbuild.transform('\\xFF', { loader: 'base64' })).code,\n      (await esbuild.build({ stdin: { contents: '\\xFF', loader: 'base64' }, write: false })).outputFiles[0].text,\n    ])\n    console.log([\n      (await esbuild.transform(new Uint8Array([0xFF]), { loader: 'base64' })).code,\n      (await esbuild.build({ stdin: { contents: new Uint8Array([0xFF]), loader: 'base64' }, write: false })).outputFiles[0].text,\n    ])\n\n    // Old output\n    [ 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n' ]\n    /* ERROR: The input to \"transform\" must be a string */\n\n    // New output\n    [ 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n' ]\n    [ 'module.exports = \"/w==\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"/w==\";\\n' ]\n    ```\n\n-   Update the getter for `text` in build results ([#&#8203;2423](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2423))\n\n    Output files in build results returned from esbuild's JavaScript API have both a `contents` and a `text` property to return the contents of the output file. The `contents` property is a binary UTF-8 Uint8Array and the `text` property is a JavaScript UTF-16 string. The `text` property is a getter that does the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion only if it's needed for better performance.\n\n    Previously if you mutate the build results object, you had to overwrite both `contents` and `text` since the value returned from the `text` getter is the original text returned by esbuild. Some people find this confusing so with this release, the getter for `text` has been updated to do the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion on the current value of the `contents` property instead of the original value.\n\n-   Publish builds for Linux LoongArch 64-bit ([#&#8203;1804](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1804), [#&#8203;2373](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2373))\n\n    This release upgrades to [Go 1.19](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19), which now includes support for LoongArch 64-bit processors. LoongArch 64-bit builds of esbuild will now be published to npm, which means that in theory they can now be installed with `npm install esbuild`.

A good example might be a dumb component, that uses mostly `@Input()` and `@Output()`.\r\n\r\nRight now there is no way to override this behaviour so if you want to generate a dumb component, you need to:\r\n\r\n1. remove `ngOnInit()` method, \r\n2. remove `implements OnInit` clause from the component class,\r\n3. remove the OnInit import from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nThis has to be repeated for every component generated, so it gets old really fast 🤷 \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIdeally, there should be an option to generate a component that does not implement the `ngOnInit()` hook.\r\n\r\nMaybe something like this could work:\r\n```ng g c component-name --skip-on-init``` or ```ng g c component-name --skip-lifecycle```\r\n\r\nIt would match the naming of flags such as `--skip-tests` or `--skip-selector`.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23678","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add flag to ng generate component that skips adding ngOnInit() interface.\" (#23678)"},{"Id":"1323459968","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-03T08:25:56","Actor":"spraju92","Number":"23664","RawContent":null,"Title":"npm WARN deprecated source-map-resolve@0.6.0 for @angular-devkit/build-angular package","State":"closed","Body":"Good day, Team.

A type-only import which uses the `type` keyword *inside the curly braces*\r\n2. `emitDecoratorMetadata` is `true` in tsconfig.json\r\n3. Certain type imports\r\n4. Production build\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThis problem happens when you use type-only imports (using the `type` keyword) using the [syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-5.html#type-modifiers-on-import-names) introduced in TypeScript 4.5 where you use the `type` keyword inside the curly braces:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { type SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\nand does *not* happen when you use the `type` keyword outside the curly braces:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWe enable `emitDecoratorMetadata` in tsconfig.json due to [eslint rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/) which require type information (otherwise it thinks DI classes in the constructor should be type-only imports, for example, but they can't be)\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThis problem only happens with certain imports, and only with `@angular` imports. Known failing types:\r\n\r\n- `import { type SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core'`\r\n- `import { type Route } from '@angular/router'`\r\n\r\nKnown types that don't cause the error:\r\n\r\n- `import { type Routes, type CanLoad } from '@angular/router'`\r\n- `import { type OnInit, type OnChanges } from '@angular/core';`\r\n- `import { type HttpHeaders, type HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http'`\r\n- any other npm module, e.g. `import { type Observable } from 'rxjs'` - this works fine\r\n- any local module, e.g. `import { type MyInterface } from './interface'` - this works fine\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThis problem only happens on production builds. Regular development builds and `ng serve` work without issue.

It overwrites one another, both of these features are very impactful to a website. Both run separate builds so technically they will overwrite each other and won't be able to use alongside each other. I can't search for a way/workaround to run them simultaneously, I also can't find hints on prerender/app-shell docs. I need both of these features on my app, this is an issue on my part.

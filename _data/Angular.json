This should be more familiar for people coming from other similar tools, as well as make better use of large screens.\n\n-   Allow decorators after the `export` keyword ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    Previously esbuild's decorator parser followed the original behavior of TypeScript's experimental decorators feature, which only allowed decorators to come before the `export` keyword. However, the upcoming JavaScript decorators feature also allows decorators to come after the `export` keyword. And with TypeScript 5.0, TypeScript now also allows experimental decorators to come after the `export` keyword too. So esbuild now allows this as well:\n\n    ```js\n    // This old syntax has always been permitted:\n    @&#8203;decorator export class Foo {}\n    @&#8203;decorator export default class Foo {}\n\n    // This new syntax is now permitted too:\n    export @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    export default @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n    In addition, esbuild's decorator parser has been rewritten to fix several subtle and likely unimportant edge cases with esbuild's parsing of exports and decorators in TypeScript (e.g. TypeScript apparently does automatic semicolon insertion after `interface` and `export interface` but not after `export default interface`).\n\n-   Pretty-print decorators using the same whitespace as the original\n\n    When printing code containing decorators, esbuild will now try to respect whether the original code contained newlines after the decorator or not.

It looks like the build process only checks whether the `server.ts` file exists - even if the file is empty, the build goes through without issues and the app is served but if it's missing, you get an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n✘ [ERROR] TS6053: File '/path/to/your/app/server.ts' not found.\r\n  The file is in the program because:\r\n    Root file specified for compilation [plugin angular-compiler]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your app depends on some custom logic written in server.ts, e.g custom providers, injecting those into your app doesn't work right now in dev mode and it throws an error: `NullInjectorError: No provider for [your_injectable]`.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nMinimal reproduction:\r\n\r\n- ng new test-app --ssr\r\n- add console.log to `server.ts`\r\n- ng serve\r\n\r\nMessage from console.log won't appear in the terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction of example when you want to provide values in `server.ts` ([e.g. as in migration steps from @nguniversal to @angular/ssr](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/3810bd4e0a0018c16b1009f4caf68c74f966551e/packages/schematics/angular/migrations/update-17/replace-nguniversal-engines.ts#L157))\r\n\r\n- run `ng new test-app --ssr`\r\n- manually create injection tokens e.g for REQUEST\r\n- in `server.ts`\r\n```\r\nimport { REQUEST } from './src/express.tokens';\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n server.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n   const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n   commonEngine\r\n     .render({\r\n      bootstrap,\r\n      documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n      url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n      publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl },\r\n        { provide: REQUEST, useValue: req },\r\n      ],\r\n    })\r\n    .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n    .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n- inject the `REQUEST` token e.g. in `app.component.ts`\r\n- run `ng serve`\r\n\r\nAfter opening the app, you'll see `R3InjectionError`:\r\n```\r\n[vite] Internal server error: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_AppComponent])[InjectionToken REQUEST -> InjectionToken REQUEST -> InjectionToken REQUEST]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken REQUEST!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.3\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.0.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.3\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26472","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"application builder: In SSR body of `server.ts` is not taken into consideration when running `ng serve` with `@angular-devkit/angular-builder:dev-server`\" (#26472)"},{"Id":"2007992390","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T11:02:51","Actor":"reduckted","Number":"26470","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng test does not run tests from new test files when watching","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhile `ng test` is running and watching for changes, if you add a new test file, that file is detected and causes the tests to run again, but the tests in that new file are not included in the test run.

Previously we couldn't do it because we didn't want to introduce a dependency to `@angular/cdk`.\r\n\r\n### feat(youtube-player): automatically load youtube api\r\nCurrently users have to load the YouTube API themselves which can be tricky to get right and be prone to race conditions. Since there's only one way to load it, these changes switch to doing so automatically. Loading the API automatically also enables us to optimize the component further in a follow-up PR by showing a placeholder image.\r\n\r\nIf users don't want the API to be loaded automatically, they can disable it through an input or using the newly-introduced `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_CONFIG` injection token.\r\n\r\nFixes #17037.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** there was an earlier attempt at this feature in #21401 which didn't land due to some concerns around API loading. We've discussed this with @jelbourn and agreed that they're no longer a problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28171","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"YouTube player features\" (#28171)"},{"Id":"2006129507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T11:25:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28174","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/core): switch pseudo checkbox to tokens theming API","State":"open","Body":"Reworks the pseudo checkbox component to be themed through the tokens API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28174","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/core): switch pseudo checkbox to tokens theming API\" (#28174)"},{"Id":"2006122187","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T11:22:29","Actor":"poveu","Number":"28173","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug([MatChipInput]): matChipInputAddOnBlur: true + selecting option by click inserts 2 chips","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThis is an intentional duplicate of https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19279, because it's been closed with a workaround that no longer works with the new Angular Material components (v15+).\r\n\r\nThe workaround was to set `matChipInputAddOnBlur` to `false` and handle the `(blur)` event on our own while ignoring the one that is related (`relatedTarget`) to `mat-option` element, however, now, clicking the `mat-option` will fire the `FocusEvent` with `relatedTarget: null`.\r\n\r\nMy updated (and working) workaround looks like this:\r\n```\r\naddOnBlur(event: FocusEvent) {\r\n    const target: HTMLElement = event.relatedTarget as HTMLElement;\r\n\r\n    if (!target) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this.addCustomChip(this.itemInput.nativeElement.value); // or manually create MatChipInputEvent etc...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the original issue is still there.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rd38q1-b74xmz?file=src%2Fapp%2Fchips-autocomplete-example.ts,package.json,src%2Fapp%2Fchips-autocomplete-example.html,src%2Fmain.ts\r\n![81319947-011e3200-90c3-11ea-8cd3-4556ec9ff622](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/32791888/69bf1bf5-5da3-49ae-b633-1c7a67791e88)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the selected option should become a chip\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe input text also becomes a chip\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v15+\r\n- CDK/Material: v15+\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28173","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug([MatChipInput]): matChipInputAddOnBlur: true + selecting option by click inserts 2 chips\" (#28173)"},{"Id":"2005315191","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T07:58:11","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28168","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps): convert test components to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"It also adjusts docs to use standalone components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28168","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps): convert test components to standalone\" (#28168)"},{"Id":"2005251171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T07:56:49","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28167","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): convert test components to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28167","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): convert test components to standalone\" (#28167)"},{"Id":"2004663884","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T07:55:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28162","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8d37c84` -> `1cd003b` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `c4feed0` -> `24dd667` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `deec585` -> `8d620dd` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Even though the animation appears to happen, the callbacks do not get called.

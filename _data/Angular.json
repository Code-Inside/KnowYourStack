Duplicate template reference names are allowed across different template scopes (for example, inside nested `ng-template` elements), but must be unique inside the same scope.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nDuplicate template reference variables can lead to confusing behavior and unexpected results, especially when developers query elements with `viewChild`, `viewChildren` or rely on template reference variables in component logic. Catching these issues at compile-time improves developer productivity and reduces runtime surprises.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBelow are examples that mirror the test cases included with this diagnostic.\r\n\r\n1) Sibling duplicate (triggers warning)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div #ref>First element</div>\r\n<span #ref>Second element (duplicate)</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Multiple duplicates (multiple warnings)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div #ref1>First</div>\r\n<span #ref1>Second</span>\r\n<p #ref1>Third</p>\r\n<div #ref2>Fourth</div>\r\n<span #ref2>Fifth</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Allowed: duplicate in different template scope (no warning)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div #ref>Outside template</div>\r\n<ng-template #tmpl>\r\n\t<span #ref>Inside template (allowed - different scope)</span>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4) Structural directive templates (treated as same scope)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div #ref>Outside</div>\r\n<div *ngIf=\"true\" #ref>Structural directive (duplicate)</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5) Complex nested example\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n\t<span #outer>Outer span</span>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<p #outer>Nested paragraph - duplicate</p>\r\n\t\t<ng-template #template>\r\n\t\t\t<span #inner>Template span</span>\r\n\t\t\t<div #inner>Template div - duplicate</div>\r\n\t\t</ng-template>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n###  Message\r\n\r\n ```text\r\n Template reference variable '#ref' is defined more than once.

To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A zoneless builder option would remove friction and help teams migrate off Zone.js cleanly. 👍\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUse the builder’s providersFile hook so the internal init module applies zoneless before tests:\n\n1. angular.json\n```\n  \"test\": {\n    \"builder\": \"@angular/build:unit-test\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\n      \"runner\": \"vitest\",\n      \"buildTarget\": \"::development\",\n      \"providersFile\": \"src/test-providers.ts\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n2. src/test-providers.ts\n```\n  import { provideZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';\n  export default [provideZonelessChangeDetection()];\n```\n3. tsconfig.spec.json (ensure the file is compiled):\n```\n  \"files\": [\"src/test-setup.ts\", \"src/test-providers.ts\"]\n```\n\n...this works but is not discoverable and requires extra wiring that could be automated by the builder.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31195","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request: First-class zoneless support in @angular/build:unit-test (Vitest)\" (#31195)"},{"Id":"3409116928","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T16:12:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31190","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: use static target: automation label in renovate config","State":"closed","Body":"The `target: automation` label is used by the Angular team to identify PRs that are created by automation.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe default (migrated) @angular/build:karma package would output test artifacts into `dist/test-out/<uuid>`, which would quickly build up folders and make it confusing as test results usually aren't a distributable. \r\n\r\nIssue Number: #30713\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe default output directory has been reverted to `.angular/cache/test-out`. Comments have been put in place to prepare the idea to extend it to later allow for custom output directories. It was not clarified if Google itself are depending on this and might require this, so if this is the case let's quickly revisit it and see how we can expand the current solution.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not certain if it \"breaks\".

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Since I can't show my code, I will be using the example given in the docs to show a few of the weird behaviors I noticed. You can follow along with the [Date range picker forms integration example](https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms) in the docs.\n\nI'm sorry for not using the intended way of creating the bug request but I saw no way to report basically identical bugs in one ticket in another way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**Link**: see description\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n#### Bug 1: Start/end stays invalid, then fixed by proxy\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

This was added in v16 to support SSR without relying on an infinite `setTimeout` with ZoneJS like it did pre-v16. Prior to version 16, this was also only done on the server and did not affect clients or unit tests. (https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/28c68f709cdc930e12bac51a266e7bf790656034)\r\n\r\n=== Additional background information ===\r\n\r\nPrior to #54949, `PendingTasks` contribute to `ApplicationRef.isStable` but did not contribute to the stability of `ComponentFixture`. This divergence in stability behavior was not intended. By aligning the two behaviors again, this includes all pending tasks in the stability of fixtures. This is likely to be a pretty large breaking change test with `HttpClient`. Tests appear to quite often use `await fixture.whenStable` when there are unfinished requests that have not been mocked or flushed.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents request in `HttpClient` from contributing to stability through the `PendingTasks` in tests by not including the stability contribution in the mock backend. In this scenario, requests need to be flushed manually for them to resolve, which is problematic for existing test suites which do not flush them before `await fixture.whenStable`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: `HttpClient` interceptors are no longer contribute directly to `ApplicationRef.isStable` without ZoneJS. `ApplicationRef.isStable` is used for SSR to determine when to serialize the application. If there is async work in interceptors that is not captured by ZoneJS and needs to be included in the SSR serialization, these should be updated to keep the zone unstable by running a timeout inside the zone and clearing it when the async interceptor work is finished.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55075","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(http): Only contribute to `ApplicationRef.isStable` indicator in …\" (#55075)"},{"Id":"2211906765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T21:29:10","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55074","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): Fix clearing of pending task in zoneless cleanup implement…","State":"closed","Body":"…ation\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a mistake in #54952 where the first pending task was falsey because its ID is 0\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55074","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): Fix clearing of pending task in zoneless cleanup implement…\" (#55074)"},{"Id":"2211809682","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T20:10:22","Actor":"pfeileon","Number":"55073","RawContent":null,"Title":"[i18n] `ng insert-i18n` (reverse `ng extract-i18n`)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nlocalize\n\n### Description\n\nThere is a barrier for using Angular's i18n solution because eventually the source code and source language file will differ and to keep them in sync the source code needs to be manually updated which means a developer has to spend time on an automatable task.\r\n\r\nIf the process was two-way, the i18n package would be way more useful; and not only for its core intent but also for simply maintaining the text content of an app.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIdeally the cli supports a command to write the strings from the extracted source language file back into the source code.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng insert-i18n\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRight now the differences between language file and source code need to be cleaned up manually or by writing a custom automation script.

But the problem is that there is no way to know what inputs are required or not. This is due to an input being required or not is not part of the [ComponentMirror](https://angular.io/api/core/ComponentMirror) interface  as previously reported https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52117.\r\n\r\nHaving to know what inputs are required or not greatly limits the ability of createComponent to actually work as a dynamic component factory. As it stands right now only components without required signal inputs can be dynamically created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI see two solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1. Don't error (like when @Input({ required: true }) is used)\r\n2. Add information to each input if it is required or not to the ComponentMirror interface\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative is that you can not use signal inputs and stick with the old way.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components with a 'required' signalized input can not be dynamically created with createComponent\" (#55071)"},{"Id":"2209339298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T18:32:13","Actor":"jomaendle","Number":"55058","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dead link leads to 404","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\n- Coming from here: https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup#withxsrfconfiguration\r\n- Clicking on [security guide](https://angular.dev/guide/http/security)\r\n- Results in \"Page not found\"\r\n<img width=\"659\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/32535140/9cebd2c8-207a-44e2-bcd6-9372e957ce91\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/http/setup#withxsrfconfiguration\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nClicking the mentioned link\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\nLinking to correct page\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n<img width=\"659\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/32535140/9cebd2c8-207a-44e2-bcd6-9372e957ce91\">\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55058","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dead link leads to 404\" (#55058)"},{"Id":"2209849725","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T18:32:12","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55060","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: link to http security now at best-practices/security","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #55058\r\n\r\nThe remaining link is being fixed by #55029 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55060","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: link to http security now at best-practices/security\" (#55060)"},{"Id":"2211527627","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T18:21:41","Actor":"devversion","Number":"55070","RawContent":null,"Title":"[17.3.x]: Patch port of new signal API access modifier enforcement","State":"open","Body":"Patch port of #54981","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55070","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[17.3.x]: Patch port of new signal API access modifier enforcement\" (#55070)"},{"Id":"2211477517","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T18:11:14","Actor":"bencodezen","Number":"55069","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix outdated security guide reference","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It particularly impacts accessibility (with aria-labelledby attributes expecting unique id values) and form handling (where label elements use the for attribute to reference input elements by id). \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a new field in the component decorator to enable automatic ID uniqueness on a per-instance basis. When this boolean field is set to true, would instruct Angular to automatically prefix id, for, aria-labelledby, and any other attributes that reference IDs, with a unique component instance identifier, ensuring that every instance of a component has uniquely identifiable elements without additional effort from developers.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Currently, developers can manually manage unique IDs by incrementing an identifier for each component instance. This approach is simple but prone to human error.\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-tracked',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p [id]=\"instance + 'tracked'\">Im tracked.</p>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class TrackedComponent {\r\n  private static instance = 0;\r\n  instance = TrackedComponent.instance++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Another workaround involves creating custom directives (e.g., [uid] and [ufor]) that communicate through a service to ensure ID uniqueness within the same component instance. Due to the lack of direct references to component instances, this method requires implementing a custom mechanism to track and associate directive instances with their respective component instances. This adds a layer of complexity, as developers must ensure accurate tracking and synchronization across component lifecycles, making it a less than ideal solution.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55062","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unique ID generation for component instances\" (#55062)"},{"Id":"2209915080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T05:41:53","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55061","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): prevent exeception on state serializer","State":"open","Body":"`Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` returns `null` if `obj` is an empty object. `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` throws on `null`/`undefined`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55061","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): prevent exeception on state serializer\" (#55061)"},{"Id":"2209674969","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T02:23:34","Actor":"HCenggel","Number":"55059","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update content-script.ts","State":"closed","Body":"Useless consoles should be commented, as the console will affect the development experience.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\n[https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539)\n[https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800](https://togithub.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800)\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>expressjs/express (express)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.19.2`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4192--2024-03-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.19.1...4.19.2)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Improved fix for open redirect allow list bypass\n\n### [`v4.19.1`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4191--2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.19.0...4.19.1)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Allow passing non-strings to res.location with new encoding handling checks\n\n### [`v4.19.0`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#4190--2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.18.3...4.19.0)\n\n\\==========\n\n-   Prevent open redirect allow list bypass due to encodeurl\n-   deps: cookie@0.6.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I want to deploy an angular ssr app under a subpath of a domain, for example https://example.org/myapp. This subpath is handled by an nginx reverse proxy. So far so good.\r\n\r\nNow I'm adding baseHref to the angular.json. It gets added to the index.html, everything fine. But if I'm looking to the `server.ts` I see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the baseUrl is always empty. Because the baseUrl can only be set if the code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nserver.use('/myapp', router);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout using .use() the baseUrl MUST be empty. So I don't understand the whole purpose behind the default code? And of course it's not working with the default code, otherwise I wouldn't write.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this scenario is not possible without changing the server.ts fundamentally. And it would be nice, if this changes are described in the docs.\r\n\r\nOr if they were the default and changes to the baseHref option in the angular.json would also affect the server.ts. That I don't have to change the server.use() part manually.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17.3.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27356","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 17 SSR baseHref / baseUrl is not respected\" (#27356)"},{"Id":"2203699853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-25T10:17:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27346","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.24.9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.24.8` -> `v3.24.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.24.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This means that a person updating from v17.1.2 to v17.2.x or higher has a high likelihood of a broken application layout due to the library's changes. The m3 changes should not be considered minor changes according to [semver](https://semver.org/), and should have caused a v18.0.0 release instead.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have an application that has been laid out based upon the sizes of components in the m2 spec present in v17.1.x\r\n2. Update a supposedly non-breaking minor version, v17.2.x, and see the components all change size to match the m3 spec and break your application's layout.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA major version should be released and v17.x's latest version should be the latest version to align with the m2 spec.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA minor version was released and v17.x's latest version breaks applications that worked with v17.1.2.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Any\r\n- CDK/Material: v17.3.1\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28788","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): The m3 design spec updates are a breaking change, and should not be considered SemVer minor releases in v17.\" (#28788)"},{"Id":"2211759091","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T19:39:18","Actor":"Kerrick","Number":"28787","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): v17.1 (the last version to omit m3) is not present in version switcher","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThe version switcher on the docs site allows me to switch between latest and v16, but not between latest and v17.1, which is the version of Angular Material before the components began switching to m3 specs.

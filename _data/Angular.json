These types of changes across multiple rounds of change detection were still executed before the browser paint.\r\n\r\nThis update allows the `NgModel` workaround to continue working in Zoneless.

You can explicitly include inputs and outputs in your component's API by expanding the entry in hostDirectives`. \r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/directives/directive-composition-api#including-inputs-and-outputs\r\n\r\nSo I would expect this to work:\r\n```\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level2]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level1Directive, inputs: ['background'] }],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level2Directive {}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level3]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level2Directive, inputs: ['background']}],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level3Directive {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut actually I get error saying:\r\n`TS-992017: Directive Level2Directive does not have an input with a public name of background.`\r\n\r\nWhat more this actually works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level3]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level2Directive }],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level3Directive {}\r\n```\r\nand exposes input of `Level2Directive` **implicitly**\r\n\r\nWhat I expect is even deeply hosted directives should only allow for explicitly defined input and outputs, with ability to alias those inputs and outputs which is especially important when multiple directives are hosted with input names that overlap.\r\n\r\nI also think that deeply realiasing should be possible as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level2]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level1Directive, inputs: ['background : bg'] }],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level2Directive {}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level3]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level2Directive, inputs: ['bg : bckg'']}],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level3Directive {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand aliasing overlaping inputs form difrent hosted directives should be possible:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level2]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: Level1Directive, inputs: ['background : bg'] }],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level2Directive {}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level2]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: OtherLevel1Directive, inputs: ['background : bg'] }],\r\n})\r\nexport class OtherLevel2Directive {}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[level3]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [\r\n    { directive: Level2Directive, inputs: ['bg : bckg'']},\r\n    { directive: OtherLevel2Directive, inputs: ['bg : bckg2'']},\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nexport class Level3Directive {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

So, when I close this new page, I could go back to my previous page with everything left as it was.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know that I can save somewhere previous component's state, and re-init with that state data when I come back to that page, but it's not a good solution, here's why:\r\n\r\n1. I cannot always save each state of a components, there might be some pure template (html/css/js, css animations, etc.) related things which I cannot save and re-init with.\r\n\r\n2. Even if I can save each state of a component, it would be huge overhead to always check every time whether I have added this some new state into my state saving mechanism.\r\n\r\n3. There might be really heavy to render components with lot's of initial calculation, so when I needed to switch to a different route for a second (maybe, select something from my list in a different route) and come back, I don't want it to re-render everything.\r\nInstead, I want to keep my prevoius page as it is (like as if I just hide it) when I want to open some different, and want to come back in a second. And, maybe come back with some data even (but this is another feature..)\r\n\r\nSome real-world scenarios:\r\n\r\nWhile I am filling a hude Form, I need to fill select input, when I couldn't find proper item from a select input dropdown, I would want to add this item into that entity which should be done in a totally different route, so if I could open that route as a dialog* (page dialog - this is a name of my requesting feature), I wouldn't need to save everything on this page into some service, I would just add my new item and continue filling my form in my previous page.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAs a solution, I think, I need some directive to use with routeLink, like: routerLinkAsDialog maybe. So, when I set this to true, I want Angular not to destroy my current component, and open new route component on the top of my current component. When I close that new page (with selecting something, or by saving something) I want to come to my last active page.\r\n\r\nIt is going to look like having layers of pages which are alive, so, when I close one, the last one going to open, etc.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAlternattive considerations would be the ability to access data of my active pages. However, it is not that critical feature to have.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55207","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Optionally keeping previous Component non-destroyed while routing to a new Component\" (#55207)"},{"Id":"2224823514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T16:03:47","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55212","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use structural directives workflow for structural directives docs.","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #53078\r\n\r\ndemo: https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-55212-adev-prev-v156o4s2.web.app/guide/directives ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55212","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: use structural directives workflow for structural directives docs.\" (#55212)"},{"Id":"2225823838","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T15:27:41","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"55216","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add docs on RouteReuseStrategy ","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThere are no docs on how this feature works.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55207\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55216","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: add docs on RouteReuseStrategy \" (#55216)"},{"Id":"2224858199","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T14:57:03","Actor":"pchabros","Number":"55213","RawContent":null,"Title":"`ActivatedRoute` doesn't work in angular elements (web component)","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nelements\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis component works as expected inside Angular app -

(ex: Whenever a docker dev environment is running on a windows host.) This is solved by adding poll option to the webpack dev server configuration. By default when no poll interval is set watchpack will use native file system change detection. This change allows for setting the poll interval which will turn on polling.

However, now I want to use the `--poll` with `ng build` for a library and this doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe only workarounds I'm left are: \r\n\r\n> For some reason nodemon and webpack-dev-server hot reload does not work in WSL2.

User Experience\r\n1) for **shared hosts** unable to switch on new HTTP, the user experience is slow choppy\r\n2) for host <--> endpoint browsers that pass through **legacy HTTP proxies,** the user experience is slow and choppy\r\n3) for **mobile clients with intermittent connectivity,** there are multiple points of failure in downloading application code, creating cases extremely hard to debug when 234 tiny files loaded fine, but 2 silently failed\r\n\r\nB. Deployment process\r\n1) Having to deploy and account for multiple files **slows down** some forms of deployment quite significantly. In one case we use remote distributed filesystem, where change from 5 files to hundreds means standard `rsync` command turns from 3-4 minutes to 30-40 minutes\r\n2) **Partial deployment failures are hard to spot.** With 3-4 files you can see incomplete deployment vividly when you inspect the target directory; with hundreds there is no practical way to see if all files are deployed.\r\n3) **Partial deployment failures may pass sanity test** and only show in PROD after user stumbles upon edge case. In unlucky case, the chunk that's failed to deploy may not be part of core functionality, and only be noticed as missing long time after.\r\n4) **Partial deployment failures are harder to cleanup.** Deleting hundreds of files take 100x times longer than deleting a couple of them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, dealing with hundreds of build artifacts instead of handful **increases operational costs and operational risks** proportionally.\r\n\r\nIf we can get a path forward within Angular+ESBuild pipeline, even building necessary extension ourselves — that would be much appreciated.\n\n### Exception

The reason that I use this `deployUrl` is it provides a lot of benefit to deploy application to different places (servers) with different path of JS and CSS files. I'd had not faced this issue with version 10. In this version 16, I got many errors in the log. The error looks like this below.\r\n\r\n`Unable to locate stylesheet: /dist/apps/{appName}/browser/{appName}/styles.ab877c333925063d.css`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo disable this error, I tried to set this `inlineCriticalCss` with `false` value in `server.ts` file, but the problem is the page got flicker with blue links which caught user attention. I must force to remove this `inlineCriticalCss` and leave the log in the console.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`\r\n...\r\nserver.engine(\r\n    'html',\r\n    ngExpressEngine({\r\n      bootstrap: AppServerModule,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        { provide: 'someToken', useFactory: () => tokenData, deps: [] },\r\n      ],\r\n      inlineCriticalCss: false\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n...\r\n`\r\nThe log on this error kept increasing every day. I had done many research around this issue and still there is no solution so far. I am trying to create this issue here is not to duplicate what had been raised before but to support the idea to fix this issue in Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe information

the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`. This means that providers available only to the\n    component that defines the `RouterOutlet` will no longer be available to\n    route components in any circumstances. This was already the case\n    whenever routes defined providers, either through lazy loading an\n    `NgModule` or through explicit `providers` on the route config.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit |

I have newest version (17.3.2) but I see my buttons in old (m2) way. After inspecting the styles, it seems variables are taken from predefined themes with (for example) old border radius value:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/dc2219b5-6cfa-4160-b688-91de4563168a)\r\nvs\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/30a91ea1-32e1-473e-89a7-32389e3acfc3)\r\n\r\nI found out I need to follow this page to be able to implement m3 styles properly (with usage of material-experimental) https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3 but there's no obvious way to apply it from the button's page code overview https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview\r\n\r\nI checked stackblitz example for buttons that you present and it seems there's a needed dependency on material-experimental in order to be working properly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/6a14037e-16ec-458f-b68e-bab93734a764)\r\n\r\nSo I'd suggest to put some switch in docs between m2 and m3 appearances, so it's clear what is what. It seems docs are now exclusively m3 and what was before about copy'n'paste of piece of code is now about wandering through docs and finding out you need to actually install material-experimental to make it look like it. Because by default m2 styles are used but they're no more shown in the docs.\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/button/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28808","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Button): For m3 buttons there's a needed dependency on material-experimental?\" (#28808)"},{"Id":"2220439372","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T12:47:49","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"28809","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(button): add support for filled tonal button same as in M3 spec","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/buttons/guidelines#07a1577b-aaf5-4824-a698-03526421058b\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/25394362/06bdb8b5-e8fb-4639-a9ad-026562f0176a)\r\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28809","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(button): add support for filled tonal button same as in M3 spec\" (#28809)"},{"Id":"2220109642","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T10:14:12","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"28807","RawContent":null,"Title":"Non-text contrast ratio between keyboard focus and background of 'Edit' button is less than required 3:1 ratio.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsers with limited visions will not be able to see the focus between keyboard focus and background on 'Edit' clearly.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

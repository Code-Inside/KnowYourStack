For example, a sum of values should be less than 100, I want the validator to be triggered when any control in the form array changes, it's a validator that is applicable to multiple controls, thus it should be part of the array validators.\n\nI also hope a path selector like this (with paths like `arrayControl.*.controlName`, as in take all `controlName` controls within arrayControl) would be available in new signal forms, with the added performance benefit that only matched controls (and not all array controls) will trigger the validators to re-run.\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI volunteer myself to make an attempt at implementing it for Reactive forms, similar to `.get` in case this is approved.

While upgrading our large-scale application to Angular 20, we encountered some questions and limitations related to browser support that we would like to clarify and formally request enhancements for.\n\n✅ Facts\n\n- Our service officially supports Chrome ≥ 67 and iOS ≥ 14, \nand our Browserslist configuration has been aligned with these requirements.\n\n- Up through Angular 18, this setup worked without issues.\n\n- After upgrading to Angular 20, running the development server now triggers Unsupported Browsers warnings whenever our configured browsers fall below Angular’s Baseline requirement.\n\n- Reviewing Angular CLI source code indicates that Angular does not ignore our Browserslist settings. Instead, Angular compares them to the new Baseline and emits warnings when they do not meet the threshold.\n\n- We already operate a Babel + core-js polyfill pipeline, which ensures that Chrome 67 and iOS 14 work properly in our production environment.\n\n⸻\n\n？ Questions / unclear points in the documentation \n\n1. Before Angular 20, Angular followed a “latest two major versions” support model. With Angular 20 adopting the “widely available Baseline,” it is unclear whether this change:\n\t•\teffectively reduces the supported browser range, or\n\t•\tsimply standardizes the criteria without reducing actual support. The documentation does not clearly explain this transition.\n\n2. We would like to know whether Angular 20 introduces any significant ES or language-level changes that justify meaningfully raising the minimum browser requirements relative to Angular 18.\n\n3. Our application is extremely large-scale (over 1 million lines of Angular code) and must support over 99% of users, including those on older browsers.Since we already use a custom Babel + core-js polyfill pipeline, we want to know whether Angular can provide official mechanisms that:\n\t•\tallow broader or lower browser targets, and\n\t•\tsupport custom polyfill strategies for teams that require extended browser compatibility.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide an official “extended polyfill mode”\n\nThis mode could offer:\n\t•\tAutomatic polyfill determination based on Browserslist\n\t•\tNative integration of core-js within Angular’s build pipeline\n\t•\tThe ability for applications to opt in to supporting browsers below Angular’s Baseline\n\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"polyfillMode\": \"extended\"\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n-","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31751","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can Angular Provide a Way to Guarantee Support for a Broader Range of Browsers?\" (#31751)"},{"Id":"3608776022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-11T06:39:18","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31748","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bump min version of vitest to 4.0.8","State":"closed","Body":"This bump the vitest peer dep to 4.0.8\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31748","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: bump min version of vitest to 4.0.8\" (#31748)"},{"Id":"3608467905","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-11T01:39:46","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31747","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `3986950` -> `55d321e` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `7fa1ab5` -> `7b0cc89` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `7fa1ab5` -> `7b0cc89` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - Every 2 hours, between 12:00 AM and 10:59 PM ( * 0-22/2 * * * ) in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n### [`v0.25.12`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02512)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.11...v0.25.12)\n\n- Fix a minification regression with CSS media queries ([#&#8203;4315](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4315))\n\n  The previous release introduced support for parsing media queries which unintentionally introduced a regression with the removal of duplicate media rules during minification. Specifically the grammar for `@media <media-type> and <media-condition-without-or> { ... }` was missing an equality check for the `<media-condition-without-or>` part, so rules with different suffix clauses in this position would incorrectly compare equal and be deduplicated. This release fixes the regression.\n\n- Update the list of known JavaScript globals ([#&#8203;4310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4310))\n\n  This release updates esbuild's internal list of known JavaScript globals. These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global `Array` property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global `scrollY` property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free. This update adds the following global properties:\n\n  From [ES2017](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2017/):\n\n  - `Atomics`\n  - `SharedArrayBuffer`\n\n  From [ES2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/):\n\n  - `BigInt64Array`\n  - `BigUint64Array`\n\n  From [ES2021](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/):\n\n  - `FinalizationRegistry`\n  - `WeakRef`\n\n  From [ES2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/):\n\n  - `Float16Array`\n  - `Iterator`\n\n  Note that this does not indicate that constructing any of these objects is side-effect free, just that accessing the identifier is side-effect free. For example, this now allows esbuild to tree-shake classes that extend from `Iterator`:\n\n  ```js\n  // This can now be tree-shaken by esbuild:\n  class ExampleIterator extends Iterator {}\n  ```\n\n- Add support for the new `@view-transition` CSS rule ([#&#8203;4313](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4313))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now has improved support for pretty-printing and minifying the new `@view-transition` rule (which esbuild was previously unaware of):\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n\n  /* Old output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition { navigation: auto; types: check; }\n\n  /* New output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The new view transition feature provides a mechanism for creating animated transitions between documents in a multi-page app. You can read more about view transition rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;view-transition).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://redirect.github.com/yisibl).\n\n- Trim CSS rules that will never match\n\n  The CSS minifier will now remove rules whose selectors contain `:is()` and `:where()` as those selectors will never match. These selectors can currently be automatically generated by esbuild when you give esbuild nonsensical input such as the following:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  div:before {\n    color: green;\n    &.foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}:is().foo{color:red}\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}\n  ```\n\n  This input is nonsensical because CSS nesting is (unfortunately) not supported inside of pseudo-elements such as `:before`. Currently esbuild generates a rule containing `:is()` in this case when you tell esbuild to transform nested CSS into non-nested CSS. I think it's reasonable to do that as it sort of helps explain what's going on (or at least indicates that something is wrong in the output). It shouldn't be present in minified code, however, so this release now strips it out.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n### [`v0.25.12`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02512)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.11...v0.25.12)\n\n- Fix a minification regression with CSS media queries ([#&#8203;4315](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4315))\n\n  The previous release introduced support for parsing media queries which unintentionally introduced a regression with the removal of duplicate media rules during minification. Specifically the grammar for `@media <media-type> and <media-condition-without-or> { ... }` was missing an equality check for the `<media-condition-without-or>` part, so rules with different suffix clauses in this position would incorrectly compare equal and be deduplicated. This release fixes the regression.\n\n- Update the list of known JavaScript globals ([#&#8203;4310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4310))\n\n  This release updates esbuild's internal list of known JavaScript globals. These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global `Array` property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global `scrollY` property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free. This update adds the following global properties:\n\n  From [ES2017](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2017/):\n\n  - `Atomics`\n  - `SharedArrayBuffer`\n\n  From [ES2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/):\n\n  - `BigInt64Array`\n  - `BigUint64Array`\n\n  From [ES2021](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/):\n\n  - `FinalizationRegistry`\n  - `WeakRef`\n\n  From [ES2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/):\n\n  - `Float16Array`\n  - `Iterator`\n\n  Note that this does not indicate that constructing any of these objects is side-effect free, just that accessing the identifier is side-effect free. For example, this now allows esbuild to tree-shake classes that extend from `Iterator`:\n\n  ```js\n  // This can now be tree-shaken by esbuild:\n  class ExampleIterator extends Iterator {}\n  ```\n\n- Add support for the new `@view-transition` CSS rule ([#&#8203;4313](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4313))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now has improved support for pretty-printing and minifying the new `@view-transition` rule (which esbuild was previously unaware of):\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n\n  /* Old output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition { navigation: auto; types: check; }\n\n  /* New output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The new view transition feature provides a mechanism for creating animated transitions between documents in a multi-page app. You can read more about view transition rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;view-transition).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://redirect.github.com/yisibl).\n\n- Trim CSS rules that will never match\n\n  The CSS minifier will now remove rules whose selectors contain `:is()` and `:where()` as those selectors will never match. These selectors can currently be automatically generated by esbuild when you give esbuild nonsensical input such as the following:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  div:before {\n    color: green;\n    &.foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}:is().foo{color:red}\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}\n  ```\n\n  This input is nonsensical because CSS nesting is (unfortunately) not supported inside of pseudo-elements such as `:before`. Currently esbuild generates a rule containing `:is()` in this case when you tell esbuild to transform nested CSS into non-nested CSS. I think it's reasonable to do that as it sort of helps explain what's going on (or at least indicates that something is wrong in the output). It shouldn't be present in minified code, however, so this release now strips it out.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

are recommending that maintainers for packages such as esbuild switch to [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.4.4`](https://redirect.github.com/kriszyp/lmdb-js/compare/v3.4.3...v3.4.4)\n\n[Compare

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n- Use `Uint8Array.fromBase64` if available ([#&#8203;4286](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4286))\n\n  With this release, esbuild's `binary` loader will now use the new [`Uint8Array.fromBase64`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/fromBase64) function unless it's unavailable in the configured target environment. If it's unavailable, esbuild's previous code for this will be used as a fallback. Note that this means you may now need to specify `target` when using this feature with Node (for example `--target=node22`) unless you're using Node v25+.\n\n- Update the Go compiler from v1.23.12 to v1.25.4 ([#&#8203;4208](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4208), [#&#8203;4311](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4311))\n\n  This raises the operating system requirements for running esbuild:\n\n  - Linux: now requires a kernel version of 3.2 or later\n  - macOS: now requires macOS 12 (Monterey) or later\n\n### [`v0.26.0`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0260)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.12...v0.26.0)\n\n- Enable trusted publishing ([#&#8203;4281](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4281))\n\n  GitHub and npm are recommending that maintainers for packages such as esbuild switch to [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.24.2`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.24.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.24.1...v14.24.2)\n\n- Fixes MCP server issue where `googleapis` is not available.

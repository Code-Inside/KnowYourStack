Generic types not supported, because FormGroup takes only concrete types.\r\n2. (Nested) member fields of complex types not supported because of various reasons. \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nDirective in Angular is similar to attribute in C#. Attributes in C# is used by .NET run time, and directive is used by Angular compiler.   I would purpose such solution with some pseudo directives.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\texport interface Entity {\r\n\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * Multiple addresses\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\taddresses?: Array<DemoWebApi_DemoData_Client.Address> | null;\r\n\r\n\t\t/** Max length: 255 */\r\n\t\t@validation([Validators.email, Validators.maxLength(255)])\r\n\t\temailAddress?: string | null;\r\n\t\tid?: string | null;\r\n\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * Name of the entity.\r\n\t\t * Required\r\n\t\t * Min length: 2\r\n\t\t * Max length: 255\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\t@validation('Super Hero', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(2), Validators.maxLength(255)])\r\n\t\tname: string;\r\n\t\tphoneNumbers?: Array<DemoWebApi_DemoData_Client.PhoneNumber> | null;\r\n\t\tweb?: string | null;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Application codes:**\r\n```js\r\nconst myFormGroup = FormGroup.create<Entity>();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NG compiler or its pre-processor or IDE generates**\r\n```js\r\nconst myFormGroup = new FormGroup({\r\n\t\t\temailAddress: new FormControl<string | null | undefined>(undefined, [Validators.email, Validators.maxLength(255)]),\r\n\t\t\tid: new FormControl<string | null | undefined>(undefined),\r\n\t\t\tname: new FormControl<string | null | undefined>('Super Hero', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(2), Validators.maxLength(255)]),\r\n\t\t\tweb: new FormControl<string | null | undefined>(undefined),\r\n\t\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes a nested complex object like \"addresses\" is to be included in the FormGroup, then a directive like `@formGroup(1)` or `@formArray()` could decorate a respective member field.\r\n\r\nThe reason why `@formGroup()` has a number parameter is to avoid endless recursive nesting.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIf such feature is implemented, WebApiClientGen just need to exporting respective directives according to C# attributes.\r\n\r\nAn alternative design is to have a declarative object to associated a data model/interface with a validation map, mapping some member fields with some validations. However, such approach may look almost the same as the current way, and require a lot more design change in Angular compiler. And this is not friendly to code generators like WebApiClientGen","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52559","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate typed FormGroup including validations from interface/model through declarative info of validations\" (#52559)"},{"Id":"1980254576","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-07T01:28:15","Actor":"mikimaine","Number":"52555","RawContent":null,"Title":"Try out Inject link navigates to 404","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen clicking  Try out Inject it 404's\r\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/roadmap\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52555","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Try out Inject link navigates to 404\" (#52555)"},{"Id":"1980295641","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-07T00:12:24","Actor":"atscott","Number":"52558","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.0-rc.3 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52558","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.0-rc.3 release\" (#52558)"},{"Id":"1980293388","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-07T00:07:18","Actor":"atscott","Number":"52557","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.0-rc.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.0-rc.3\" with changelog.\" (#52557)"},{"Id":"1980282809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-06T23:54:18","Actor":"Martinspire","Number":"52556","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improvement: Identifying defer and blocks for testing and perhaps other stuff","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, on the [tests of the new Angular site](https://angular.dev/guide/defer) we finally see some unit tests for Defer loading, with mainly this syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Retrieve the list of all defer block fixtures and get the first block.\r\nconst deferBlockFixture = componentFixture.getDeferBlocks()[0];\r\n// Render loading state and verify rendered output.\r\nawait deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Loading);\r\nexpect(componentFixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Loading');\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this component:\r\n```\r\n@defer {\r\n  <large-component />\r\n} @loading \r\n Loading...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I'm guessing it just scans the HTML for blocks and picks the first one. But what would happen if I add a new defer block before my code, it will trigger the new defer block and not the old one. Hence, my existing tests will fail and if you have a few defer blocks in a single component, it would perhaps accept a few tests that are meant for a different block.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA way to identify the block so it is easier to test and perhaps also reference. I'm not entirely sure what all the use cases can be for this but I'm sure you guys can figure it out quickly. Chaining defer blocks and triggering other defer blocks seems like an inventive use case that could make Angular standout by just using the template to trigger other components and service calls.\r\n\r\nSo instead of the previous block we write:\r\n```\r\n@defer (as myDeferBlock) {\r\n  <large-component />\r\n} @loading {\r\n  Loading...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the tests I can now use:\r\n```\r\n// Retrieve the list of all defer block fixtures and get the first block.\r\nconst deferBlockFixture = componentFixture.getDeferBlock('myDeferBlock');\r\n// Render loading state and verify rendered output.\r\nawait deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Loading);\r\nexpect(componentFixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Loading');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a similar syntax to how async variables get referencing:\r\n```\r\n@if (users$ | async; as users) {\r\n  {{ users.length }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd you can also chain it with triggers: \r\n\r\nPerhaps with triggers you can add it at the back: `@defer (on hover; as myDeferBlock) {`\r\n\r\nI also see an added benefit of using the identity to trigger another defer or to have another component with no direct relation to the defer, to know when a service is done loading an item in its template. An API could be used in the other component to trigger on defer loading with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor (private deferDoneLoading: DeferDoneLoading) {}\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.deferDoneLoading.onLoaded('myDeferBlock').subscribe((value) => this.myFunctionToRunOnChildLoaded(someValue));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr another defer `@defer (on myDeferBlock) {` so you can chain requests and data without having to add a single subscription, just pure templates.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to not have it at all and just rely on an array that may or may not be filled. Especially when mixing defer blocks into for-loops it could be problematic to know how many there will be and in what order they will exist. And having to add broker services that trigger other events or adding a lot of subscriptions for the sake of triggering other subscriptions is tedious and takes more time to test when they could be talking to each other directly.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is not set in stone, I don't know the inner logic well enough to know what is and isn't possible, but if one could identify or store a reference to a defer block some way, it would make a lot of interesting things possible.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improvement: Identifying defer and blocks for testing and perhaps other stuff\" (#52556)"},{"Id":"1979691783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-06T23:53:17","Actor":"atscott","Number":"52532","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Add warning when signal equality is false for object.is","State":"closed","Body":"This commit adds a warning when a signal equality function returns `false` but `Object.is` returns `true`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52532","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): Add warning when signal equality is false for object.is\" (#52532)"},{"Id":"1980247933","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-06T23:16:17","Actor":"mdafanasev","Number":"52554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Defer syntax doesn't create lazy chunks when component imported from a barrel","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the new defer syntax with component imported from a barrel file (like a `index.ts` with re-exports) the expected lazy-loaded chunks are not created.

For comparison, the NX documentation features their equivalent command prominently on the homepage. A direct link to the [guides](https://angular.dev/overview) and [reference](https://angular.dev/api) sections is provided, but the formatting makes it easy to overlook.\r\n\r\n2. **General Navigation Concerns:**\r\n   - On mobile, navigating the documentation is cumbersome. After selecting a menu item, the menu closes, and reopening it is necessary to continue to sub-sections, which is not user-friendly.\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation Flow:**\r\n   - The \"Start Coding\" section redirects to a tutorial, which is unexpected. It would be more logical to present `ng new` at this stage.\r\n   - The tutorials page at [First App Tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app) does not mention the `ng new` command. Additionally, it's unclear whether installing Angular globally is still the recommended practice.\r\n\r\n4. **Tutorial Navigation:**\r\n   - The dropdown menus in the tutorial section feel clunky. A dual-mode navigation system, allowing users to switch between tutorial steps and direct access to topics, could enhance the experience.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the sleek design of the site, but it seems there are opportunities to refine the UX to better support developers. This is a subjective perspective, and I apologize for the brevity of my feedback. I am open to discussing these points further and would be happy to contribute to improving the user experience.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52547","RelatedDescription":"Open

Being there allows me to easily click the DOM elements and see both their final styles as the properties that are bound to the elements, the state. I would love it if Angular Devtools enabled a similar view that is able to be closer to my code.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that annoys me when inspecting is that RxJS observables, mainly those using async pipes, are difficult to view what they currently hold. Of course I could work around this by logging the item to console and adding functions there to log it, or put break points in my code to see whats what. But I feel thats kinda overkill and not really necessary what helps me quickly view how data flows through my app (especially if you are finding a side-effect of a component that transformed a value that you are looking where it was changed like that). A better integration on RxJS would help junior devs a lot and I think its the main thing missing from devtools. Aside being near what I see when I right click an element to inspect it. \r\n\r\nSimple state overview on a certain element from angular state inspector:\r\n<img width=\"579\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/1716267/2e028c48-99ca-4a6b-92f8-a1b0a9432956\">\r\n\r\nPretty useless subscription when inspecting an observable in angular devtools:\r\n<img width=\"241\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/1716267/a26c8deb-9e64-4d91-880c-1c9f92278284\">\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution [Feature Request only]\r\n\r\n-Be closer to the regular element inspector, allowing me to quickly see what data these elements hold and what their current value is.\r\n-Improve compatibility with RxJS for devtools to not just show operator and source (where operator somehow opens lift.js and source is either an endless list of other operator/source children or it shows _subscribe and when clicking the (...) it just goes to where the observable class was defined)\r\n\r\nBecause what does a dev want to inspect?

since passing a similar glob path in `include` would work but it never worked in `exclude`!!\r\n\r\nSeems like the `include` option in the angular builder for karma is normalized, while the `exclude` is passed directly to the glob method.\r\nI see there are a lot of changes to the `include` strings that are made before it is used to match the files.\r\nBut, the `exclude` seems to be used directly without any modifications.\r\n\r\nI think the `exclude` should have at least been normalized like the `include` for common user errors like using back-slashes or the relativeProjectRoot.\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b479063ab5ef625a5ee883bf5cc335572bdcb83e/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/karma/find-tests-plugin.ts#L112 Opens

had included the relative project root (src/) in `include` and it worked as expected, but when I included the same in `exclude` it didn't work.\r\nAs a user, I would think that `include` and `exclude` strings would work the same way, but in fact, it is not.\r\nAlso, I can't find this behavior documented anywhere.\r\nI see only 2 special cases documented

(Normally, you wouldn't need to bind the dist folder, but if you're building a custom image to maximize caching, you don't want to bind the volume to the working directory, but just the specific output directories).\r\n\r\nYou can get around the issue by calling `rm -rf ./dist/* && ng build --delete-output-path=false`. However, this is not tied to the actual configuration, where the output path may be different depending on the configuration.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThis is slightly contrived, but illustrates the problem (you wouldn't actually want to do this, but it's easier than building an image from scratch):\r\n\r\n- Run `docker run -it -v ./dist:/app/dist -v .:/app --rm node:18 /bin/bash` in an angular project\r\n- Run `cd /app` to go to the app\r\n- Run `npx ng build --delete-output-path=true` in the docker container\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nEBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir '/app/dist'\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.2.8\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 8.10.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.8 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.8 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.8 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/material               16.2.10\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.8 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nIt looks like angular calls the `deleteOutputDir` method [here in the browser](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/browser/index.ts#L110) and [here in the server](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/server/index.ts#L220) to delete the output path. The method in question can be found [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/delete-output-dir.ts#L15). If we used something like fs-extra's `emptyDirSync` (see [here](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/a277cbbdf630424482b1e7418749ccaac0db98fe/lib/empty/index.js#L20)) instead, we could just empty the output directory rather than deleting it. This would make it a lot more usable and should have theoretically the same impact without running into lock errors or permission errors on the file.\r\n\r\nI would put in a PR, but I'm not currently on a machine where that's easy to do!\r\n\r\nIf this would be considered a breaking change, another thought would be to add another flag.

This is confusing to users if they don't realize they need to remove focus from the chips field in order for the element to become enabled.\r\n* When a required chips component is the last field in a form, followed by a conditionally disabled submit button and a cancel button, a user may accidentally hit the cancel button if they attempt to tab to the submit button.\r\n* With chips that can be dragged and dropped, the chips field does not necessarily receive focus when chips are moved around. This results in chips being visibly moved, but the form control value does not get updated. Since order generally matters for chips that can be dragged and dropped, a user could get the desired order visually, while a different order gets persisted upon submission.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-chips-bug-f6octd?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a required chips field followed by a submit button conditionally enabled by the validation of the preceding field\r\n2. Focus on chips input\r\n3. Select option or type out input\r\n4. Hit **Enter** key on keyboard\r\n5. Hit **Tab** key on keyboard\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe submit button should receive focus because it is enabled after hitting **Enter** in the chips field. The chips form control value should be updated immediately when a chip is created.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe submit button does not receive focus.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.12\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.11\r\n- Browser(s): Tested in Chrome and Firefox, likely reproducible in others\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Tested in Windows, likely reproducible in others\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatChipGrid): Chips form controls do not update values until focus is achieved and lost\" (#28065)"},{"Id":"1980141768","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-06T22:00:23","Actor":"smoothiesrock","Number":"28064","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(stepper): Can't find any documentation on changing the default mat-step-header tabindex","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nI'm unable to find any supporting documentation for programmatically overriding the default mat-step-header tabindex behavior in any of the stepper variants.

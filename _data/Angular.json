Basically, we are trying to contain styles in the library itself and do not want to explicitly import any styles into the application that consumes the library. \r\n\r\nWe are currently utilizing the Syncfusion Angular Scheduler component in an exportable Angular library. You can find more details [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/schedule/getting-started).\r\n\r\nConventionally, we provide styles for our ej2-angular-scheduler control by importing them from the node_modules directory as follows:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-buttons/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-calendars/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-dropdowns/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-inputs/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-lists/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-popups/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-navigations/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule/styles/material.css';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have encountered an issue where, during the ng build process, the styles are bundled correctly in a standard Angular application and the component renders as expected. However, when building the same component within an Angular library and when we packed and export it, the styles are not bundled properly, leading to issues with the component rendering in the consuming application it take more time for compilation as well as styles not applied. \r\n\r\nCould you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue or suggest best practices for managing styles in Angular libraries to ensure they are properly bundled and applied?\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have attached a sample demonstration where an exportable Angular library (mylib) contains the Scheduler component. The MyApp sample shows how we packed the library and utilized the library in an application that consumes it without explicitly adding styles.\r\n\r\n[Demostration.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16612902/Demostration.zip)\r\n\r\nReplication procedure:  \r\n* Build the library(mylib) and locally pack the library.\r\n* Move the packed library to the Angular application (myapp).\r\n* Install the packed library through package.json and compile the application. \r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNot applicable\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular 17, node 18\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nNot applicable","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28199","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular doesn't properly bundles stylesheets into the library's output\" (#28199)"},{"Id":"2460228448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T09:05:36","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28190","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

While the affected documentation page shows that it is a component that is compatible with m3 styles, implementing this into a class:\r\n`@include mat.chips-color($theme, $color-variant: $color);`\r\napplying the class to a mat-chip does not affect the color variant.\r\n\r\nI have labeled this as a docs bug because m3 styling options are not referenced at all in the mat-chips documentation here: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview and there are no examples of styling chips in the docs. If styling chips is an intended feature, this issue should be moved into m3 bug as the scss is not producing correct styling when including the mat.chips-color mixin.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAfter a couple of hours of testing, I have identified that color variance only affects 'mat-chip-option' components when they are selected. This should be included in component overview documentation and potentially have an example with various styling as to show that color variance will not affect the standard mat-chip.\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29576","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Chips\" (#29576)"},{"Id":"2458588865","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T11:37:10","Actor":"BobobUnicorn","Number":"29565","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/tree): fix issue where `isExpanded` wouldn't be set if placed before `isExpandable`","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29565","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/tree): fix issue where `isExpanded` wouldn't be set if placed before `isExpandable`\" (#29565)"},{"Id":"2460928412","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T06:09:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29573","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): update state if control changes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the form field wasn't accounting for the case where the form control is swapped out.\r\n\r\nFixes #29402.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29573","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/form-field): update state if control changes\" (#29573)"},{"Id":"2460290001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T05:54:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29570","RawContent":null,"Title":"Account for disabledInteractive in test harnesses","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that a few test harnesses weren't accounting for the new `disabledInteractive` inputs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29570","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Account for disabledInteractive in test harnesses\" (#29570)"},{"Id":"2460504553","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-12T20:16:07","Actor":"Binek115","Number":"29571","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Chips): Overview examples in form integration section are not working","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nIt is not possible to show code nor open stackblitz.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview#use-with-angularforms","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29571","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Chips): Overview examples in form integration section are not working\" (#29571)"},{"Id":"2460790320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-12T20:16:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29572","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/chips): wrong example name","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the chips doc weren't referring the an example correctly.\r\n\r\nFixes #29571.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(material/chips): wrong example name\" (#29572)"},{"Id":"2459242778","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-12T11:56:02","Actor":"moondc","Number":"29567","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): mat-select dropdown color doesn't support theme switching","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSwitching the theme from light mode to dark mode (or vice versa) does not apply the new styles to mat-select's panel.

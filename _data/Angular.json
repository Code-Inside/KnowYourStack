So each of those modules (like economy, locations and many more that I've omitted) have `RouterModule.forChild()` with the inner routes for every child component.\r\n\r\nNotice the commented out \"accounting\" route. It's the only route that directly lazy-loads a standalone component. It's done this way because the library it uses now requires it to be standalone.\r\n\r\nHere's the issue though. While trying to expand the \"accounting\" route to become a module like every other module (to have more routes inside) and simply import the AccountingDashboardComponent into that new module, I noticed that the runtime is broken with a random error `Error: Invalid provider for the NgModule 'NgxsRootModule' - only instances of Provider and Type are allowed, got: [..., ..., ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...]`.\r\n\r\nIn fact it doesn't even work if I **remove** the lazy-loading and directly state `component: AccountingDashboardComponent` for that route. In fact, and that's the weirdest part, it will fail even if I remove the \"accounting\" route completely...\r\n\r\nDays of digging into this have lead me to conclusion that it has been broken in the version 18, because I can easily remove the route in my old branch that uses Angular 17 and everything's fine.\r\n\r\nMore specifically I found that in Angular 18 _I basically have to have at least one standalone component in my router in order for it to stop erroring_. I turned `ResetPasswordModule` (which only represents one component) into a standalone component and imported it directly into the router via `loadComponent` and that eliminated the error. Now I can update my old \"accounting\" route without any errors.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly not the resolution I want, something's not right, I want to understand it and fix it. I don't have to be forced to use standalone components this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: Invalid provider for the NgModule 'NgxsRootModule' - only instances of Provider and Type are allowed, got: [..., ..., ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms    \r\n... language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server     \r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nwebpack                         5.91.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I couldn't create a reproduction of the bug.

It's like navigating a catwalk without a clear exit route, leaving me uncertain about the best path forward. If you start with new skinny clothing all plays nice, but older larger clothing is a problem.\r\n\r\nA flag system would empower me to explicitly opt out of these features and ensure my code remains maintainable and future-proof, allowing me to continue using established syntaxes while still having the option to adopt newer ones as I see fit.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility would greatly improve my development experience, enabling me to balance innovation with stability and reduce the risk of breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, Angular team? Could a flag system be added to give developers more control over their project's evolution?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAll current deprications will be removed \r\nthough in cases this gives problems, have environment.ts settings that can keep allowing certain things like old style routeguards for example.\r\n\r\nOne might also then be able to opt in for a set of specific new language features\r\nAs this lives at the project level special attention should be put to imports, as external imports may involve different flag setups.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nFreeze the language, no more deprecations, but add extension modules to enrich the language.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprication flag system\" (#56941)"},{"Id":"2401816726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-10T22:04:52","Actor":"rbalet","Number":"56939","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(localize): avoid redirection loop in the apache2.conf example","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The presence of the import attribute takes precedence over all other loading behavior including JS/TS and any `loader` build option values. This allows per file control over loading behavior. For general loading for all files of an otherwise unsupported file type, the `loader` build option is recommended.\r\n\r\nFor the import attribute, the following loader values are supported:\r\n* `text` - inlines the content as a string\r\n* `binary` - inlines the content as a Uint8Array\r\n* `file` - emits the file and provides the runtime location of the file\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this time, TypeScript does not support type definitions that are based on import attribute values. The use of `@ts-expect-error` or the use of individual type definition files (assuming the file is only imported with the same loader attribute) is currently required.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TypeScript `module` option must be set to `esnext` to allow TypeScript to successfully build the application code.\r\n\r\nAs an example, an SVG file can be imported as text via:\r\n```\r\n// @ts-expect-error TypeScript cannot provide types based on attributes yet\r\nimport contents from './some-file.svg' with { loader: 'text' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the development server and a file that is referenced from a Node.js package with a loader attribute, the package must be excluded from prebundling via the development server `prebundle` option. This does not apply to relative file references.\r\n\r\nThis feature provides the bundling aspects of #26575. TypeScript type definition support would provide the full feature set for that issue but is currently blocked on TypeScript upstream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28040","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): support import attribute based loader configuration\" (#28040)"},{"Id":"2404001024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T19:59:39","Actor":"kfrederix","Number":"28039","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): remove Vite \"/@id/\" prefix for explicit external dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a Vite plugin to remove the `/@id/` prefix (which gets inserted by Vite during import-analysis) for explicit externalDependencies.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I would be more than willing to submit a PR after discussion.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere's a StackBlitz link with a simple repro case:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rbro7s?file=angular.json\r\n\r\n1. `rxjs` and `rxjs/operators` are declared as `externalDependencies`\r\n2. importmap is added in index.html to resolve these dependencies at runtime\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n﻿Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

`/assets`.  \r\n\r\nThen, maybe in the `build` object, we could add an `assetsPath: string` which, when given `assetsPath: /$localize` would then upload the assets to all the localize

The `dev-server` builder from these packages will currently assume a `development` configuration is present within the `build` target. The default behavior may be expanded in the future to support more arbitrary `build` target configurations. If there is third-party package usage within the `build` target, the CLI will attempt to discover a `dev-server` builder within the same package used by the `build` target. If none is found, no default will be added and the `serve` command will issue an error when no explicit target is present.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28011","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): provide default serve target for applications\" (#28011)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2403689410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T21:54:42","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29423","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update getting started","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the Getting Started guide:\r\n- Change links from angular.io to angular.dev\r\n- Update guidance on importing the components (default to standalone guidance)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29423","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update getting started\" (#29423)"},{"Id":"2404074340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T20:36:37","Actor":"urugator","Number":"29425","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/coercion): `coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` has invalid implementation or signature","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` works the same way as `coerceNumberProperty(thing)`, so it yields `0` if the `thing` isn't coercible to number.

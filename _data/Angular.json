An `@include` feature, like `@include('./example.html', item)`, would enable including 'example.html' in the template, using the local `item` variable.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an `@include` directive in Angular:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@include('./example.html', {item: someItem, item2: otherItem})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 'example.html', use an `@input(){}` block to bind to `item`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@input(item) {\r\n  <h1>{{ item.title }}</h1>\r\n  <p>{{ item.description}}</p>\r\n}\r\n\r\n@input(item2) {\r\n  <h1>{{ item2.title }}</h1>\r\n  <p>{{ item2.description}}</p>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows directly including HTML content with scope binding, without creating a full component.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe current method involves creating full components for reusable sections.

However, if the SSE is stopped and restarted, the data in the array received previously WILL be correctly visible in the dialog with the correct height. On the other hand, any new data received that is placed in the same array will, once again, be rendered empty with the wrong height.\r\n\r\nThus on the same page where I display the received data in a table, clicking on those table items received in the previous stream will bring up a dialog correctly rendered, but those received in the current stream will not.\r\n\r\nPrinting out the data that should be rendered in the dialog in a console.log() statement shows the data in all cases.\r\n\r\nA very interesting twist is if I attempt to invoke a toast message followed by the dialog, for the newly received data there is a delay of about 5-8 seconds and then the toast appears, disappears, and the dialog shows correctly. For the previously received data, both the toast message and the dialog appear immediately.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what is going on. The array is just a simple array of JSON strings defined in a service. There is no way to tell which of the elements are new and which are old (I actually load the newest at the start). So the only thing I can think of is the *ngFor loop in the html.\r\n\r\nOn each SSE reception a `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` is called so the *ngFor can update the display. The new data is displayed in a new table row where the first <td> element in the row contains a clickable icon that invokes the dialog. There has got to be something going on with the new rows added that somehow prevents the dialog from being correctly rendered.\r\n\r\nThis will be a very difficult bug to reproduce given it requires data coming from an SSE server. But perhaps you know of some underlying behavior of the EventSource in Angular that would lead to such a conflict. Maybe I am doing something that cannot be done in the Angular framework. The dialog is a CDK dialog and not raw html. Maybe I need to move to raw html to circumvent this problem.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nIt is a display error. \r\n\r\nWith previously received data, a dialog pops up on the screen displaying a FHIR Bundle as a formatted JSON string.\r\n\r\nWith newly received data, there is a dialog box that displays across the top of the screen (correct CSS width) but with a height of 37 pixels (CSS height is 96vh) and is empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.8\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/material               16.2.10\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI have a stackoverflow issue submitted but I bet no one is going to have any idea of what is going on.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/77594696/dialog-text-not-showing-in-angular-16-during-an-sse-stream\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53349","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Conflict between Server-Side-Events and Dialogs\" (#53349)"},{"Id":"2024113352","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-04T15:22:10","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"53350","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): remove setting that removes comments in CF migration","State":"open","Body":"This setting was added to prevent comment duplication, since the TS AST printer includes prior line comments as part of a given line with no way to really avoid that.

Description\r\n\r\nThere might be the case where a configuration parameter can be passed to a provideXXX() function to get an array of providers to register.\r\n\r\nLet's say we provide an AppConfig object like:\r\n```\r\nproviders: [\r\n  {\r\n    provide: AppConfig,\r\n    useFactory: configFactory\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we need to register 3rd party providers with a provideXXX(config) function (that takes a configuration parameter).\r\nIn order to provide for it, we want to use values coming from our registered AppConfig.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt would be nice being able to retrieve our provided AppConfig in order to use its values as arguments to provideXXX like:\r\n```\r\nproviders: [\r\n  {\r\n    provide: AppConfig,\r\n    useFactory: configFactory\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    providerFactory: (config: AppConfig) => provideXXX(config.someValue),\r\n    deps: [AppConfig]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how we would now be able to use our AppConfig values as a parameter to a provideXXX.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is currently a different approach to this.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53325","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add new Provider type that would allow to provide a set of providers dynamically\"

not break the build either.\r\n- \"sw-ke\" is on the repository but in a different case(`sw-KE`), the builder does manage to spot the corresponding locale, but the build exits with error code 1

the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe build command I run for my project is : \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnode --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration production\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commands runs successfully, but however the NodeJS process for building app takes up to 6GB.\r\n\r\nTo be more precise, during beginning-middle of building phase it takes less than 4GB,\r\nand always at the middle-end of building phase, it goes up to 6GB just before end of successful build.\r\n\r\nTo start investigation, I launched build command with \"-trace-gc\" option : \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnode --trace-gc --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration production\r\n```\r\n\r\nI saw, with this option, that there are several Node \"V8 isolates\" that are created in the same NodeJS process (\"V8 isolate\" = JS Heap instance, based on [Node GC documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/diagnostics/memory/using-gc-traces)) : \r\n\r\nAmong those \"V8 isolates\", with a proper heap for each, 2 of them have particular high heap amount at the same time : \r\n\r\n- The main one (Instance : 0000017EBED1F120) goes up to 3.6 GB of heap\r\n- A another one (Instance : 0000017FCBC9E030), created at middle-end of build phase, goes up to 2GB\r\n\r\nWhat also have to be noticed is that the second one consumes such a memory ONLY when option \"production > optimization > scripts\" in \"angular.json\" is set to true.\r\nThe \"production > optimization > scripts\" option in \"angular.json\" is required for my production performance requirements (minification, tree-shaking, dead-code elimination).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo my questions/remarks are : \r\n\r\n*  The \"max_old_space_size\" parameter seems to mainly apply to the MAIN V8 isolate, so I'm not able to configure \"global\" memory consumption during build phase. Is there a parameter to configure the GLOBAL heap used by NodeJS process for building phase ? If not, I think it could be useful to have one, and/or be able to fine-tune memory for all V8 isolates with high memory consumption\r\n\r\n* I cannot find any documentation explaning the fact that \"production > optimization > scripts\" option can result in high memory consumption, why it takes such memory, how I could tune it. Is is possible to have such a documentation / explanation ?\r\n\r\n* I also found this issue about memory limits for several \"V8 isolates\" in NodeJS, and was wondering whether it could be linked to my issue : [worker: resourceLimits overridden by --max-old-space-size](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43991)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCommand run

Most of the tabs are detached and reattached until the tab is closed.\r\n\r\nThe active tab is determined from the currently active route on each navigation end event. This way if the application is loaded with a specific url, the appropriate tab is selected.\r\n\r\nConsider the following routes:\r\n```\r\n- /tab1\r\n- /tab2\r\n- /tab2/sub1\r\n- /tab2/sub2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the `/tab2` route, another tab group is present with links to the sub routes (and of course a sub router-outlet as well).\r\n\r\nIf we load the app with the `/tabs2/sub2` route, the components of `/tab2` and `/tab2/sub2` are loaded, which also means that the tab2's ink is initialized to the second tab in the header.\r\n\r\nNow, if we navigate to `/tab1`, these components are not destroyed, however the tab link active flags are set to false because neither `/tab2/sub1` nor `/tab2/sub2` is active after the navigation ends.\r\n\r\nThen if we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2`, the components are not reinitialized (because of the reuse strategy). but the active flag is changed for the `/tab2/sub2` tab link (because it is now active after navigation end).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nckgfk?file=src%2Ftab-active-tracker.directive.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n2. Click on Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner tab group loaded [OK]\r\n3. Click on Sub-Tab 1 -> upper Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n4. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> upper Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK]\r\n5. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n6. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], **inner Sub 2 is NOT highlighted [NOK]**\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter the step 6 the ink should be re-initialized even if set to the same value.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the active status is properly set (font is bold on the inner Sub-Tab 2 header element) but the ink is missing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I found the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen we navigate from the `/tab2/sub2` back to `/tab1`, neither the `/tab2/sub1` nor the `/tab2/sub2` routes are active so the `selectedIndex` is set to `-1` and the ink's `hide()` is called. However, the index just set is not processed until the next `ngAfterContentChecked` call.\r\n\r\nNow, when we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2` (which was the last active inner tab) the ink handler thinks that despite the selection index is changed (from `-1` ro `1`), the selection itself is not changed.\r\n\r\nI think that in the `hide()` function of `MatInkBar` the `this._currentItem` should be set to `null`. Because next time when `alignToElement` is called, the `correspondingItem === currentItem` check will be true (but the index was changed from `1 -> -1 -> 1` but it was not processed due to a missing `ngAfterContentChecked` call)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/0762d69b394343555488b5aaada9444dd1a5083a/src/material/tabs/ink-bar.ts#L40\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.5\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.2\r\n@angular/material               17.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTabLink): Underline (MatTabInk) is missing if combined with route reuse strategy\" (#28229)"},{"Id":"2023770717","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-04T12:42:19","Actor":"iosipov27","Number":"28228","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): when using appearance=\"outline\", input fields increases in height.

However, if I hover over any element with MatTooltip, then focus back on the number input field, the scrolling behavior unexpectedly changes. Instead of scrolling the page, it increments or decrements the number in the input. This issue can also occur on the Angular Material official [website](https://v11.material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 15 08 30](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/89395304/eef26764-cf11-4f7c-b5bb-a819239abcd6)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/angular/porobbapdry?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftooltip-delay-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to a page with a <input type='number'> with matInput.\r\n2. Hover over an element with MatTooltip.\r\n3. Focus on the number input field.\r\n4. Try scrolling over the number input field.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected and consistent user experience is that scrolling over a number input field should scroll the page, not change the input's value. This unexpected behavior disrupts the user experience, especially in forms with tooltips and number inputs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a <input type='number'> field with matInput is focused, and the user scrolls with the mouse wheel, the default behavior is for the page itself to scroll, not the number in the input field. However, this behavior changes after interacting with an element that has MatTooltip. Specifically, after hovering over a MatTooltip element and then focusing on the number input field, scrolling with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page. Instead, it changes the value in the number input field, incrementing or decrementing it. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and occurs even on the Angular Material official website.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 11\r\n- CDK/Material: 11\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28224","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Unexpected Behavior with Number Input and MatTooltip Scrolling\" (#28224)"},{"Id":"2022037380","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-02T13:17:03","Actor":"prasantht96","Number":"28222","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(@defer): Using @defer causes No provider for InjectionToken mat-datepicker-scroll-strategy! error","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUsing @defer causes this error, but without defer block it's working fine.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nyqsqs?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. in main.ts, remove @defer from template, No error. \r\n2. but if you add @defer, the error will come in console.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nthis shouldn't cause any error and everything should work.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`ERROR\r\nError: R3InjectorError(Environment Injector)[InjectionToken mat-datepicker-scroll-strategy -> InjectionToken mat-datepicker-scroll-strategy]:\r\nNullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken mat-datepicker-scroll-strategy!`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 17\r\n- CDK/Material: 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28222","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(@defer): Using @defer causes No provider for InjectionToken mat-datepicker-scroll-strategy! error\" (#28222)"},{"Id":"2021636078","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T22:29:26","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28221","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28221","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.2 release\" (#28221)"},{"Id":"2021629972","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T21:53:30","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28220","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28220","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.2\" with changelog.\" (#28220)"},{"Id":"2021618380","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T21:44:49","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28219","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28219","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.\" (#28219)"},{"Id":"2016941753","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T13:02:43","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28205","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `39de01a` -> `069ea40` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `581fbc0` -> `f00eb4c` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f00131a` -> `1d3d98f` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Some factors to consider when choosing whether to indicate selection with aria-selected or aria-checked are:\r\nSome design systems use aria-selected for single-select widgets and aria-checked for multi-select widgets.

If I make it return 1 during debug, things start to work fine.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-yehn5j?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-platform-overview-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nNotice that at the bottom of information, getRtlScrollAxisType is 2\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/17024937/4e9b569d-82a9-4d99-b437-d94b9d2faeac)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ngetRtlScrollAxisType() should return 1 for chrome.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ngetRtlScrollAxisType() returns 2 for chrome\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ~16.2.10\r\n- CDK/Material: ~16.2.10\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 119.0.6045.160, Chrome 119.0.6045.200\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10 Pro\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28209","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"getRtlScrollAxisType detects incorrect RtlScrollAxisType for chrome\" (#28209)"},{"Id":"2018156008","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-30T08:47:18","Actor":"Wilt","Number":"28208","RawContent":null,"Title":"Needs improvement: MatTextColumn is calling dataAccessor method inside the template.","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nCall of `dataAccessor` method is against Angular best practices and will be bad for performance in tables with large data sets.\r\n\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let data\" [style.text-align]=\"justify\">\r\n        {{dataAccessor(data, name)}}\r\n    </td>\r\n\r\nSee [line 30 inside `MatTextColumn` for reference](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/table/text-column.ts#L30C11-L30C35).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee [the Stackblitz and the example for `mat-text-column` inside the documentation here for a working example](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-text-column).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSet the data in a variable inside the component on initialization and bind that to the template instead.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt gets the data inside the template by calling the `dataAccessor` method.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28208","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Needs improvement: MatTextColumn is calling dataAccessor method inside the template.\" (#28208)"},{"Id":"2017114428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-29T17:47:22","Actor":"sdiachenko","Number":"28206","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSlider): MatSliderRangeThumb input width is not changed if the input value is changed dynamically","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe MatSlider does not changes the width of the input[matSliderStartThumb] and the input[matSliderEndThumb] when a user changes the inputs value dynamically.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1522\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/components/assets/40065298/c7822536-cb06-4eb1-8694-eaea71d69de0\">\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-pkhpjl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

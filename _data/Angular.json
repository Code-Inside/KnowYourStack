Digging into the Angular code it turns out that the `_compareWith` function in select_control_value_accessor.ts is being called an absurdly high number of times.\r\n\r\nI expected that this function would just be called no more than once for each item in the dropdown (i.e. loop through the options until a match is found). However, it is actually called exponentially more. E.g. for a dropdown with 1000 items and the 500th item bound to the ngModel, the function is called 501,001 times. If there are 3000 items in the dropdown and the 1500th item is selected, the `_compareWith` function is called 1,002,501 times. It gets even worse if an option nearer the end of the list is selected.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-select-performance?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nNote that I added a custom `compareWith` method in this example to log how many times it is called, but the performance is just as bad with the default internal comparison method.\r\n\r\nI think the problem stems from Angular's `SelectControlValueAccessor.writeValue()` method being called over and over for each individual option element that is rendered, rather than once after all the options are rendered.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 11.2.6\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThis is especially problematic for our users with slower mobile devices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41330","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Select dropdowns with ngValue binding perform far worse than expected\" (#41330)"},{"Id":"839034729","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-23T20:59:34","Actor":"beelia","Number":"41328","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update what-is-angular.md","State":"closed","Body":"Added today's date to freshen this guide article (updated review date)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This behaviour is caused by the setting `preferLocal=true` which makes execa search for locally installed binaries and executes them. This vulnerability is usually only exploitable when using execa on a client-side LOCAL application.\"\r\nsolution: \"Upgrade to version 2.0.0 or above.\"\r\nIdentifier: \"gemnasium\"\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI believe upgrading to a version of webpack-dev-server that does not have execa ^1.0.0 as a dependency will fix this issue.\r\n\r\nIt looks like webpack-dev-server  uses [a version of internal-ip package](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/7e525ebe35201996d047d14af05709b0b082ae7a/package.json#L52) that fixes this  and this will be released in [version 4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/releases). Although they also have **/sane/execa@^1.0.0 as a dependency due to jest. And jest v27 will remove sane/execa@1.0.0 from its dependencies as well. https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/10919\r\n\r\nFor now, users that use yarn as a package manager can place\r\n```\r\n    \"**/webpack-dev-server/internal-ip\": \"^5.0.0\",\r\n    \"**/sane/execa\": \"^2.0.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the resolutions of their `package.json`, but this is not an ideal solution.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any updates on execa 1.0.0  being removed as a nested dependency, as it affects all angular app dependencies.

collision with `Set.addAll` polyfill\n-   allow filenames starting with `../` when generation the undo path for non-web targets\n\n### [`v5.26.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.26.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.25.1...v5.26.0)\n\n### Features\n\n-   handle cache version automatically for DefinePlugin\n    -   Values no longer need to be defined as build dependencies\n-   add more options for `DefinePlugin.runtimeValue` (file/context/missing/buildDependencies, version)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix a memory leak which happens in watch mode with caching when modules are removed from the compilation\n-   fix usage of some arrow functions when es5 target is selected\n-   chunk loading in workers now uses publicPath instead of relative paths\n    -   fixes a problem when worker file is in a child directory\n\n### [`v5.25.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.25.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.25.0...v5.25.1)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix startup logic when

current runtime id\n-   improve error handling for HMR\n    -   add second argument to self accept error handler to pass new module and module id\n    -   add error handler argument to dependency accept, passing error and module ids\n-   add `output.strictModuleErrorHandling` to opt into stricter evaluation error handling semantics according to ESM spec\n    -   used by default when HMR is enabled\n-   when ignoring a module used by `new URL()` this will result in an url to a empty file (`\"data:,\"`)\n-   add `module.generator.asset.emit` option to disable creating assets from asset modules (e. g. for SSR)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix problem when library options apply to a non-runtime chunk\n-   fix crash in `splitChunks.maxSize` where negative indicies are accessed\n-   fix

build dependency\n-   fix expansion of `\"...\"` in array configuration options when it's not at the start\n\n### [`v5.24.3`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.2...v5.24.3)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix contenthash when a file is emitted twice with different filenames but that same contenthash\n\n### [`v5.24.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.1...v5.24.2)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix invalid syntax generated for destructuring with default values\n-   fix some incorrect properties accesses in watch\n    -   `modifiedFiles` and `removedFiles` were undefined\n-   fix some edge cases with

  `[hash]` and `[fullhash]` works as in webpack (i.e. it is `hash` of build, not content hash of file), to migrate change `[name].[hash].[ext]` to `[name].[contenthash][ext]`\n    -   `[ext]` doesn't require `.` (dot) before, i.e. change `[name].[ext]` to `[name][ext]`\n    -   `[<hashType>:contenthash:<digestType>:<length>]` and `[<hashType>:hash:<digestType>:<length>]` is not supported anymore, you can use `output.hashDigest`, `output.hashDigestLength` and `output.hashFunction` options to setup it\n    -

So I removed the list of commands, it's about the underlying schematics engine and the way it resolves json schema files.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe are working a lot with Angular Schematics. Authoring the schema.json files per schematic is straight-forward. In addition we also use `quicktype` to create typescript definitions for a safer handling of the involved data. To complete this setup we also try to split schematics in order to reuse or test them individually. This means some of the schematics are private. \r\n\r\nThis approach of splitting schematics creates a lot of repetition in the actual schema.json files. It happens often that we repeat dozens of schema properties across multiple schematic as they are related and sharing the same schematic API surface.\r\n\r\nA common solution to make this easier is to use $ref and combine different definitions with `allOf`. This is also exactly what you are doing in the command definitions:\r\n\r\nSee here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular/cli/commands/build.json#L1-L16\r\n\r\nAnd it seems this is only possible for the command runner as you register the required custom uri handler for local files only in there:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular/cli/models/command-runner.ts#L124-L133\r\n\r\nThe `ng-cli://` is the prefix for the [json schema `$id`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#the-id-property) (like `\"$id\": \"ng-cli://commands/build.json\"`) and allows to refer to definitions without repeating the source json file. I don't fully understand why it's working and I might miss some processing step on your side. What I see are `$ref` and `$id` references and I would like to use them too.\r\n\r\nWe users of common schematics can't do that as the usual workflow (node for us) is not receiving any capabilities to load local schema files.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/workflow/base.ts#L69-L70\r\n\r\nIf I try to use a ref I see an error thrown by the registry as the file is not located in the web (http)\r\n\r\n> An error occured:\r\n> TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]: Invalid URL: my-definition.json\r\n>    at onParseError (internal/url.js:259:9)\r\n>    at new URL (internal/url.js:335:5)\r\n>   at node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.js:88:25\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nLet me allow to use the full power of schemas to tame our huge schema files and let me a allow to split them into smaller chunks. I would like to organize my schematics like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"allOf\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"my-definition.json#/definitions/part-a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"my-definition.json#/definitions/part-b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could solve this by adding a default URI resolver for local files to the `CoreSchemaRegistry` to allow the usual schematics (`yarn schematics @my/lib:do-something`) to be based on better organized json schemas. Is there a complexity I'm missing or would this be feasible at least ?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI consider the following alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. Create our own `$ref` & `flattening` approach to feed normalized `schema.json` files into the schematics engine while we can author the individual files. This is basically preprocessing an independent set of valid but better organized json schema files into a format that Angular understands. Also extract the typescript definition files from that final schema file to consume in the code.\r\n\r\n2. Author Typescript files and share them however I like. Then derive the schema file. Same as 1) but order reversed.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering my issue.

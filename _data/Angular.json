formgroup, so that refactorings of property names are also applied to the forms or at least give compile time warnings.\r\n\r\nTake this example interface model which is send to a rest endpoint by the Http-Client:\r\n```\r\n  export interface LoginModel {\r\n  username: string;\r\n  password: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this model I have to create a FormModel:\r\n```\r\nexport interface LoginFormModel extends FormGroup<{\r\n  username: FormControl<string>,\r\n  password: FormControl<string>\r\n}> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I always have to keep the two interfaces in sync, when I change username to UserName and it is wasted time effort. \r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think it should be possible to infer types from a interface.\r\n\r\n- primitives to FormControl\r\n- Arrays and Sets to FormArray\r\n- Object references to FormGroup\r\n\r\nSomething similar like https://github.com/iamguid/ngx-mf,\r\nbut officially supported and maintained without @ts-ignore workarounds.\r\n \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep the current state and create additional interfaces or just let the form infer types.\r\nThis does not address the refactoring issues, when property names

The main one is that removing `--noshow_progress` will make Bazel print progress updates which tells Circle CI that test execution is still ongoing and avoids test failures due to lack of output.\r\n\r\nThe other notable trade-offs being made here are:\r\n1. [`--keep_going`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#keep-going) means `bazel test` will run all tests report all failures, which could be slower and noisier than reporting just the first failure but is more complete.\r\n2. [`--build_tests_only`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#build-tests-only) means only tests and binaries will be built, so any library targets not tested could have build errors hidden.

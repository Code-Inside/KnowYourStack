All those components must be imported into the consumer application for a UI feature to work. Let' say we have a `TabModule`. The `TabModule` looks something like this:\r\n\r\n**library**\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent],\r\n  exports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class TabModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn module land, a consumer of our library can simply import the `TabModule` and the Tab feature works. In standalone land the consumer has to import the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent`.\r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```typescript\r\n// Module land\r\nimport {TabModule} from '@my-org/lib';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [TabModule]\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Standalone land\r\nimport {TabGroupComponent, TabComponent} from '@my-org/lib';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis works great, but for better developer experience, we would additionally want to offer the possibility to import all components at once. Therefore we can create a `index.ts` file where we export an array that contains the `TabGroupComponent` as well as the `TabComponent`.\r\n\r\n**library - index.ts**\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const TabComponents = [\r\n  TabGroupComponent, TabComponent\r\n];\r\n```\r\n With this approach, the consumer could then simply import the `TabComponents`.\r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabComponents]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComp {}\r\n```\r\nThis works great in a multi-project workspace where we built our SPA from the library sources. But once we build our library for prod, package it and publish it on npm this approach no longer works.\r\n\r\nWe get the following compile error: \r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```\r\nError: src/app/standalone.component.ts:17:5 - error NG1010: 'imports' must be an array of components, directives, pipes, or NgModules.\r\n  Value is a reference to 'TabComponents'.\r\n\r\n17     TabComponents\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/lonely-lib/lib/index.d.ts:2:22\r\n    2 export declare const TabComponents: any[];\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Reference is declared here.\r\n\r\n\r\n✖ Failed to compile.\r\n```\r\nWe also had the case where we did not get this error but the build still failed because it was telling us that neither the `TabGroupComponent` nor the `TabComponent` were provided.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to import the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent` individually and locally create an array with them. \r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```\r\nconst components = [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent];\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nthis one worked without errors.\r\nWe then also compared the array here with the array from our library by logging them in the constructor - and they are identical. Both are arrays containing the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent`. Therefore we believe it is a bug in the compiler.\r\n\r\nThx, a lot for your feedback and the great efforts to enable standalone components in Angular.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: src/app/standalone.component.ts:17:5 - error NG1010: 'imports' must be an array of components, directives, pipes, or NgModules.\r\n  Value is a reference to 'TabComponents'.\r\n\r\n17     TabComponents\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/lonely-lib/lib/index.d.ts:2:22\r\n    2 export declare const TabComponents: any[];\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Reference is declared here.\r\n\r\n\r\n✖ Failed to compile.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.6\r\nNode: 19.3.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.2.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.6\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Standalone library barrel files\" (#49888)"},{"Id":"1671486945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T15:47:27","Actor":"MatthiasKunnen","Number":"49889","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix NgOptimizedImage distortion check for padded images","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This results in non-distorted images being reported as distorted and vice-versa. This is due to the rendered aspect ratio being calculated from the [`clientWidth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth) and [`clientHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight) which includes the padding of the element.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n`clientWidth` and `clientHeight` have been replaced by [`getComputedStyle(img).getPropertyValue('width')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) (and height equivalent) and depending on the [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing), the padding is subtracted prior to ratio calculation. This always results in the correct ratio.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of using computed width over `clientWidth` (and same for height) is that computed width returns a decimal, in contrast to the integer for `clientWidth`, which allows for greater accuracy in determining the ratio of the rendered image which prevents false positive distortion checks. It might even be possible to lower the `ASPECT_RATIO_TOLERANCE` (currently set to 0.1) and reduce the amount of false negatives.\r\n\r\nPlay around with the calculations here: <https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-image-ratio-playground?file=src/main.ts>. Scenarios are defined in `main.ts` and rendered showing the results of the various ways to calculate the ratio and whether the particular calculation is correct.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n### Test added for rounding errors\r\nI've added a test that checks for a false positive distortion check that occurs when using integers for the dimensions. This is fixed by using the computed dimensions which are returned as decimals. While this is, in my opinion, a useful addition, I could remove it if it is not desired.\r\n\r\n### Updating playground code in angular codebase\r\nI could update the playground at [`packages/core/test/bundling/image-directive/playground.ts`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3ba5dcc150676da01cbe6dc66ba6d4b3a3667bf1/packages/core/test/bundling/image-directive/playground.ts) with the setup of my stackblitz if desired. This would probably be another PR though.\r\n\r\n### Extract to separate function\r\nPerhaps the image dimensions extraction would be better in a utils lib, or exported for reuse elsewhere. If so, please let me know and I'll update it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49889","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix NgOptimizedImage distortion check for padded images\" (#49889)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1665320108","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-18T20:22:23","Actor":"KevinDufendach","Number":"25008","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI Analytics ID causes Docker build to hang","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAngular 14\n\n### Description\n\nI'm trying to build an Angular 15 project in Docker, but with CLI analytics enabled, the build always hangs at the RUN npm run build step and never completes.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee minimal reproduction here:\r\nhttps://github.com/KevinDufendach/ng-15-docker-build-issue\r\n\r\nThis a fresh Angular 15.2.5 \"ng new\" project with the Dockerfile, .dockerignore, and nginx.conf copied from a working Angular 14 fresh install.

transform for top-level `&` ([#&#8203;3052](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3052))\n\n    Previously esbuild could crash with a stack overflow when lowering CSS nesting rules with a top-level `&`, such as in the code below. This happened because esbuild's CSS nesting transform didn't handle top-level `&`, causing esbuild to inline the top-level selector into itself. This release handles top-level `&` by replacing it with [the `:scope` pseudo-class](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-scope-pseudo):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    &,\n    a {\n      .b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :is(:scope, a) .b {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Support `exports` in `package.json` for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3058](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3058))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 added the ability to use `extends` in `tsconfig.json` to reference a path in a package whose `package.json` file contains an `exports` map that points to the correct location. This doesn't automatically work in esbuild because `tsconfig.json` affects esbuild's path resolution, so esbuild's normal path resolution logic doesn't apply.\n\n    This release adds support for doing this by adding some additional code that attempts to resolve the `extends` path using the `exports` field. The behavior should be similar enough to esbuild's main path resolution logic to work as expected.\n\n    Note that esbuild always treats this `extends` import as a `require()` import since that's what TypeScript appears to do. Specifically the `require` condition will be active and the `import` condition will be inactive.\n\n-   Fix watch mode with `NODE_PATH` ([#&#8203;3062](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3062))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATH` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously a bug prevented esbuild's watch mode from picking up changes to imported files that were contained directly in a `NODE_PATH` directory. You're supposed to use `NODE_PATH` for packages, but some people abuse this feature by putting files in that directory instead (e.g. `node_modules/some-file.js` instead of `node_modules/some-pkg/some-file.js`). The watch mode bug happens when you do this because esbuild first tries to read `some-file.js` as a directory and then as a file. Watch mode was incorrectly waiting for `some-file.js` to become a valid directory.

The first visible index is now calculated based on the relation from the current scrollOffset to the max scrollOffset.\r\nSince the total content size can be off for a larger amount, it is now smoothly corrected and no longer just set to the estimated total content size.\r\n\r\nThe `virtual-for-of.ts` had a bug (?) which made it impossible to measure the size of the last item. This is now fixed, but probably a breaking change.\r\n\r\nScrolling to an index is now implemented. When scrolling to an index, the target offset for the index is calculated based in the estimated item size and a correction in case there is already a difference between the current offset and the current estimated offset. When smooth scrolling is activated, multiple scroll events will occur.\r\n\r\nWhile scrolling to an index, the behavior is different from normal user scrolling. The problem that needs to be solved in this case is, that we are scrolling to an estimated offset, which could be off but cannot be corrected anymore. Therefore, we need to adjust the content offset, even if it increases the amount of error.\r\nThis is done in two steps:\r\n- while scrolling, the rendered range is calculated based in the already scrolled amount in relation to the max scroll distance\r\n- once the target index is rendered for the first time, the content will be ideally adjusted and then no longer modified till the scroll is completed\r\n\r\nThere are some special cases, that need extra care:\r\n- target index is already rendered --> scrolling precisely by the amount of pixels\r\n- estimated target scroll offset is already rendered, but target index is not --> scroll by sizes of rendered items in between  - estimated item sizes for non-rendered items in between\r\n- scrolling to an index which close to the end of the list, so that the remaining items are smaller than the viewport --> scroll to the end as far as possible\r\n\r\nSee #10113\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@mmalerba Can you please provide some feedback here.

Do you mind if I change this by extracting them into an extra component?\r\n- FYI: horizontal window resizing causes content adjustment when scrolled (was an issue before my changes)\r\n- FYI: refreshing the page after scrolling will break scrolling to and index.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nThe keyvalue pipe sorts the entries of the input by key. This has been the subject of debate in the past (#42490). The core of the discussions is that it is often desirable (and perhaps expected) that they natural ordering of the input is respected. There are at least two workarounds to restore natural ordering, such as a `compareFn` that simply returns `1` or a custom pipe. However, both of these require code for pipe consumers to maintain or  copy around to many places.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nAllowing `null` as `compareFn` and treating it as \"natural order\" is fairly simple to understand, backward compatible and was suggested a few times on #42490 where it seemed to be received well. Using `null` is also possible in templates without any component code changes.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n *n/a*","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57487","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): disable keyvalue sorting using null compareFn\" (#57487)"},{"Id":"2480804226","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-22T13:31:03","Actor":"bleapleaper","Number":"57486","RawContent":null,"Title":"Route provider behaviour should align more with component providers (destroy them)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n      path: '1',\r\n      providers: [StateService],\r\n      children: [\r\n         {\r\n             path: ':id',\r\n             component\r\n         },\r\n         another path, another component\r\n      ]\r\n  },\r\n {\r\n   path: '2'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe navigating between path 1 and 2 does not create a fresh instance of StateService.

It will always be at least as accurate as the user's sizes value, and will often be more accurate. In cases where the user has erroneously fallen back to `sizes=\"100vw\"`, using `sizes=\"auto\"` could reduce image download by 50% or more.\r\n\r\nOn [browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlimageelement_sizes_auto) which do not support sizes=\"auto\", it is simply ignored, and srcset selection behavior will be unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen browser adoption for `sizes=\"auto\"` increases, the behavior of NgOptimizedImage could be changed to rely on `sizes=\"auto\"` completely for lazy loaded images, without requiring the user to provide `sizes` at all.

While this feature works perfectly for end users and does not impact the functionality of the site, it has caused a significant issue with SEO. After deploying the site, I checked the rendered pages in Google Search Console. The screenshots captured by Google's crawler show a blank (white) page instead of the actual content. This suggests that the Google crawler is unable to properly render the content when enableViewTransitions is enabled, leading to potential SEO issues as the pages appear empty to the crawler.\r\n\r\nIssue 2: Component Instantiation in Hierarchical Components\r\nAdditionally, I noticed a strange behavior when adding console logs in the constructors of hierarchical components (parent-child structure). Only the AppComponent was instantiated and logged in the console, while none of the child components were instantiated. This is unexpected and may indicate an issue with how components are being initialized in a hierarchical structure in this version of Angular.\r\n\r\nThese issues do not affect the user experience or the site's functionality, but they do present a significant problem for SEO. I hope the Angular team can investigate and address these problems.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nVahid\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a

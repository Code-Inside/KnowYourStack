The description in the [`providedIn` option reference](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable#providedIn) is short and precise, but not very helpful in this regard:\r\n>Provides a unique instance in each lazy loaded module while all eagerly loaded modules share one instance.\r\n1. The description in the [*Providing dependencies in modules* guide](https://angular.io/guide/providers#limiting-provider-scope-by-lazy-loading-modules) explains how the dependency is resolved, but does not give useful examples of dependencies that could benefit from this approach.\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\nIt would be great to list at least one simple example that is realistic and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nAlso, we could explain how it's different from other ways of configuring injectors.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts on the `providedIn: 'any'` provider scope:\r\n- It is useful to control stateful dependencies that vary between feature modules.\r\n- It is a tree-shakable alternative to the `forRoot`/`forChild` pattern. It keeps the dependency tree-shakable, where as if it was provided in Angular module metadata, it would always be included in the bundle, even if no component was using this dependency.\r\n- It is useful for configurations, logging, analytics, and metrics.\r\n\r\nOne of the techniques is described in [A detailed look at Angular's 'root' and 'any' provider scopes](https://indepth.dev/angulars-root-and-any-provider-scopes/).\r\n\r\n## üì∑Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èupload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Moreover, the `trackBy` function must be dead simple and fast, if the view port is large, showing enough rows with enough columns it becomes a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nUsually, most performant way to do the trackBy is just return the index.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the rowDef has changed, it will not be possible to detect it.\r\n\r\nOnce diff has been calculated, the call to `renderRows` will ignore the change in the row template definition\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/4152aec5d421d993246b1ede3803027082330492/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L611-L623\r\n\r\nIt will not call `_renderCellTemplateForItem` leaving it with the old template cached in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qvzms7?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-flex-basic-example.ts\r\n\r\nBasically, we need to have multiple row definitions (CdkRowDef) but `multiTemplateDataRows` is set to false.\r\nWe define 2 row templates with `when` predicates, where the 2 predicates are opposite, if one is on the other is off and vice versa.\r\n\r\nUsing a simple button to toggle a boolean flag we switch between the 2 predicates.\r\n\r\nIf we use a simple button it will not work, we switch the flag but it does not change the rendered template for the row.\r\n\r\nUsing the `ChangeDetectorRef` to run manual CD will not work as well because the table handles it's own diff mechanism when it comes to row diffing.\r\n\r\nThe only way (I found so far...) to force the proper row template to render is calling `_forceRenderDataRows();`  which is private. The will force render the entire dataset, using the new row template. This is bad of course, as it's using a private method and it will force render ALL rows, while in real scenarios one will only want some to re-render.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nBeing able to change the row definition template and have the CDK Table autodetect and render it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nCDK Table fail to detect changes in the row definition template.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10+\r\n- CDK/Material: 10+\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-table): Row differ (trackBy) does not detect row template changes\" (#20717)"},{"Id":"714322017","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-04T14:07:47","Actor":"video-vocabulary","Number":"20715","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(youtube-player): not able to play any videos from YouTube Movies channel","State":"open","Body":"<!--------\r\n\r\nThe Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help.

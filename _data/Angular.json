As a result, the template renders before the data arrives and does not update when the data is assigned. This issue occurs twice within the application, when populating the results of the housing locations in the home page, and when populating the housingLocation information in the details page. There is no indication in the documentation that methods need to be taken to ensure that this asynchronous data is rendered after ngOnInit completes. \n\nCurrent Flawed Code: \n\n```\n// src/app/home/home.component.ts\n\ntemplate: `\n...\n     <section class=\"results\">\n     @for(housingLocation of filteredLocationList; track $index) {\n        <app-housing-location [housingLocation]=\"housingLocation\" />\n      }\n    </section>\n... \n`\n...\nconstructor() {\n    this.housingService\n      .getAllHousingLocations()\n      .then((housingLocationList: HousingLocationInfo[]) => {\n        this.housingLocationList = housingLocationList;\n        this.filteredLocationList = housingLocationList;\n      })\n  }\n```\n\n\n```\n// src/app/details/details.component.ts\n\ntemplate: `\n     <img\n        class=\"listing-photo\"\n        [src]=\"housingLocation?.photo\"\n        alt=\"Exterior photo of {{ housingLocation?.name }}\"\n        crossorigin\n      />\n... etc. \n`\n...\nconstructor() {\n  // ...\n  this.housingService.getHousingLocationById(...).then((data) => {\n    this.housingLocation = data; // Change not detected\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/edit/main/adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/14-http/README.md\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nForcing Change Detection (If Promises Must Be Used): Instruct developers to inject ChangeDetectorRef and call this.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges(); after the assignment.\n\nRecommended Angular Practice: Refactor the example to use Observables and the async pipe, which automatically handles subscription and change detection, providing a much cleaner and safer solution for asynchronous data in templates.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65863","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Beginner Tutorial Flaw: Asynchronous Promise Resolution in Constructor Does Not Trigger Change Detection\" (#65863)"},{"Id":"3696995616","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T23:52:00","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"65862","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: followup cleanup for #65758 fallout","State":"open","Body":"Fixes some issues left behind by recent refactor\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/65862","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: followup cleanup for #65758 fallout\" (#65862)"},{"Id":"3696946347","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T23:22:21","Actor":"atscott","Number":"65861","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): Add standalone function to create a comptued for isActive","State":"open","Body":"This change deprecates `Router.isActive` in favor of a function that creates a computed which tracks whether a given url/UrlTree is active, following changes in the router state.\r\n\r\n`Router.isActive` contributes ~1333b to the bundle size, but is only used by developers who use the API directly or who use `RouterLinkActive`.

Run the application.\n2. Click the \"Model\" button. Observe that the h1 tag's content does not change.\n3. Click the \"Output\" button. Observe that the h1 tag's content changes to \"output\".\n\n## Expected behavior\nIt is expected that when the \"Model\" button is clicked, the `value` model's change is emitted, and the parent component's `value` signal is updated to 'model'. The behavior of the \"Output\" button is as expected.\n\n## Actual behavior\nWhen the \"Model\" button is clicked, the model's value change is not emitted. The explicitly defined `valueChange` output seems to override the model's implicit `valueChange` output, preventing it from firing. If the `public readonly valueChange = output<string>();` line and corresponding button is removed from `my-component.ts`, the \"Model\" button works as expected.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`model`'s implicit output is overridden by an explicit `output` of the same name\" (#65844)"},{"Id":"3692896307","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T10:22:35","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"65842","RawContent":null,"Title":"CSS renders twice from shared docs","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\n<img width=\"1005\" height=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/066ffdb8-7b29-45fe-944a-2e7aa6d2c0c0\" />\n\n<img width=\"703\" height=\"206\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/878723bc-4d01-4051-9d66-e57a10f3691a\" />\n\n<img width=\"979\" height=\"323\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b6241b-5e6a-4bd4-a4b9-c067eb63d83f\" />\n\n### There are so many!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65842","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CSS renders twice from shared docs\" (#65842)"},{"Id":"3692884446","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T04:44:57","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"65841","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs: hide trailing empty line in code examples","State":"open","Body":"Add CSS rule to hide the last empty line in code blocks to prevent displaying unnecessary empty lines when source files end with a newline character.

Description\n\nThe [Signal Forms documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/signals/models#initializing-all-fields) explicitly calls out that optional fields should be initialized as `null`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nexport interface PersonModel {\n  name: string;\n  bio: string | null;\n}\n\nexport const DEFAULT: PersonModel = {\n  name: '';\n  bio: null;\n}\n\n\n@Component({ ...

this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.11\n\n### Description\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe value of the `href` attribute of the `<base>` tag in the built `index.html` file should start with what's defined in the `baseHref` property of the builder.\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\nA leading `/` is added when the `baseHref` value does not start with one.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWe package our built apps inside docker images that process the `index.html` file on startup to replace certain strings matching `${...}` with values from environment variables.  This allows us to deliver portable docker images that can be deployed under different paths in different environments by simply setting the `BASE_HREF` environment variable.\n\nSo when building our app, we set `baseHref` in the build config to a string like `${BASE_HREF}`.\n\nWith Angular 20.3.11, this produced the following tag in `index.html` (with a localized build):\n\n```html\n<base href=\"${BASE_HREF}/en/\"/>\n```\n\nSince Angular 20.3.13, we now get a leading slash added:\n\n```html\n<base href=\"/${BASE_HREF}/en/\"/>\n```\n\nFor deployments where our `BASE_HREF` value is an empty string, this results in the base href value of `//en/` which is a protocol-relative URL and so all of our resources fail to load.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular app with 20.3.13, set baseHref to a value that does not start with `/`, enable localization, build.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.13\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.15\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.13\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.13\n@angular/build               20.3.13\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.14\n@angular/cli                 20.3.13\n@schematics/angular          20.3.13\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.9.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32030","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Leading slash added to baseHref\" (#32030)"},{"Id":"3695591991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T18:22:02","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32029","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): implement structured error handling in package manager API","State":"closed","Body":"This commit introduces a structured error handling system into the package manager abstraction.

It now re-throws the original `PackageManagerError` if a command fails for an unknown reason, preventing silent failures.\r\n- Abstracting the \"package not found\" check into the `PackageManagerDescriptor`, removing hardcoded logic from the execution layer.\r\n- Improving the `yarn-classic` parser to use verbose logs, allowing it to accurately detect and report specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 401, 403, 404, 500).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32029","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): implement structured error handling in package manager API\" (#32029)"},{"Id":"3694981007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T10:49:34","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"32028","RawContent":null,"Title":"Serve Angular Application with ngrok","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI was using ngrok to serve an Angular app in a remote link but without the configuration in the Angular.json I get an error related to vite configurations.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI don't know if there's a section in the documentation dedicated to this scenario.

This typically occurs when the value is set to \"1/1/2025\", and the user tries to change the value to \"2/1/2025\" by either:\n\n1.

Deleting the first \"1\" and then entering a \"2\"\n\nThis would be the correct and expected behavior.\n\nWith the new signal form input, it is very difficult to edit values since the datepicker deletes the field too aggressively.\n\n1.

That is effectively an undesired focus-trap\n\n2) ArrowRight/ArrowLeft keyboard navigation under no circumstances will open/close a tree node.\n\n3) Confusingly, the icon-button of mat-nested-tree-node is part of the general tab-order, on top of mat-nested-tree-node itself (though mat-nested-tree-node has tabindex=\"-1\", I assume some JS shifts focus here)\n\n4) The focus outline for nested tree nodes inside mat-nested-tree-node is some weird double-box\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- https://material.angular.dev/components/tree/examples#tree-nested-child-accessor-overview\n- https://material.angular.dev/components/tree/examples#tree-nested-overview\n\nI saved myself the effort of writing a stackblitz,  as the issue occurs quite literally in the mat-tree docs examples themselves.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n**1. Focus-trap behavior:** (Replicable only on Firefox in v21 and v20, but not v19)\n1.1. Go to one of the links above (i.e. the example \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\")\n1.2. Press tab until your focus is on the treenode \"Vegetable\"\n1.3. Keep pressing tab, your focus will bounce back and forth between the overall node and the icon button\n\n**2. Arrow-Right/Arrow-Left not opening up/closing tree node** (Replicable down to v15 in Chrome and I did not bother testing beyond that)\n2.1. Go to one of the links above (i.e. the example \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\")\n2.2. Tab until you have \"Fruit\" in focus\n2.3. Press Arrow Right and see that nothing happens\n\nNote: You can expand that tree-node, but not while the icon-button is in focus. The usual \"Press right-arrow key to open\" behavior does not happen. Pressing enter while the icon button is in focus does not lead to focusing the overall treenode as in earlier examples on the same page and a few other behavior discrepancies to other examples.\n\n**3. Icon button is in tab-order** (Replicable in v21 and v20, but not in v19, any browser)\n3.1. Go to one of the links above (i.e. the example \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\")\n3.2. Press Tab until you have \"Fruit\" in focus\n3.3. Press Tab again and see that you now have the icon button in focus\n\n**4. Extra boxy focus outline** (Replicable in v21, v20, v19 but not in v19, any browser)\n4.1. Go to one of the links above (i.e. the example \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\")\n4.2. Via mouse open \"Vegetables\" tree node\n4.3. Via tab, try to get the entire Vegetables node in focus\n4.4. Press Arrow down, you now should have the \"Green\" node in focus with a weird outline box\n\nNote: If you press enter while you have \"Green\" in focus, you will not just \"open\" Green, you will also close \"Vegetables\" for some reason.\n\nNote 2: All of the above 4 problems do **not** occur with any of the examples of nested nodes with cdk-tree!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- When I have the last element in a mat-tree in focus and press tab again I expect the focus to actually leave that tree for the next focusable element after it\n- When I have the icon button in focus and press enter or space, I get focus on the overall nested tree node (for consistent behavior with the other examples. Honestly I'd expect that icon button to not be in the tab order in the first place and was not in there in v19, what is it doing there?)\n- When I have the nested tree node in focus and press right-arrow I expect the node to open up and show its child nodes \n- When I have the nested tree node in focus, it is open and I press left-arrow, I expect the node to close and hide its child nodes\n- I expect to not see this kind of weird second box in the focus outline\n<img width=\"1293\" height=\"236\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2df26c57-f4ac-429b-bd8f-a2af7c7ce278\" />\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The tree becomes a focus-trap as described earlier\n- Arrowkey navigation is partially broken in those tree examples\n- Focus-outline on keyboard-focus has a weird second blue box in it\n\n### Environment\n\n\n- Angular: -\n- CDK/Material: I can replicate all issues in the docs for version v21, v20. The issues with arrow-left/right navigation and the weird focus-outline I can replicate even in v19 on either browser.\n- Browser(s): Firefox v145. The broken arrow-key navigation can also be replicated in Chrome v142, but the \"focus-trap\" behavior is firefox specific.\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Arch Linux\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32465","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-tree): Material tree with mat-nested-tree-node traps focus, has confusing tab-order, has issues with keyboard navigation and weird focus outline\" (#32465)"},{"Id":"3691450127","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-03T18:59:08","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"32464","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: use mjs files for ng-dev configuration (#32309)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 8e8314c6fa2a401c793370a8cc1aac0301b50ccf.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32464","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: use mjs files for ng-dev configuration (#32309)\"\" (#32464)"},{"Id":"3691128027","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-03T17:17:01","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32463","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/menu): update api goldens","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32463","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(aria/menu): update api goldens\" (#32463)"},{"Id":"3685027459","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-03T13:07:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32459","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: set up PullApprove for reviews","State":"closed","Body":"Replaces Github's code review assignments with PullApprove which is a bit more configurable and which can help reduce noise for the team.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: set up PullApprove for reviews\" (#32459)"},{"Id":"3684749019","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T17:27:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32458","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/autocomplete): work around an internal issue","State":"closed","Body":"Adds a workaround for an error that an internal caught in their production logging.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32458","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/autocomplete): work around an internal issue\" (#32458)"},{"Id":"3681934052","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T10:52:43","Actor":"jonashammerschmidt","Number":"32452","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Grid): Shift+Arrow does not move selection","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn `Grid` (`@angular/aria: 21.0.1`), Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right moves the focused cell as expected.

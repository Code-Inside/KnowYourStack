Each of them uses a router outlet to display content. The maximum number of openable windows is limited by the number of different outlets in the router config.\r\nUnfortunately, we found out, that increasing the number of sibling outlets with (the same) children routes leads to an exponential slowdown.\r\nThe debugger shows that the Recognizer.processSegmentAgainstRoute function is causing the bad performance.\r\n\r\nIn the provided stackblitz example this function takes the following times on my machine:\r\n20 outlets - 10ms\r\n200 outlets - 954ms\r\n2000 outlets - 187000ms\r\n\r\nIn our real project, these times are somewhat higher. So using a not unrealistic (20-30) number of windows already leads to long tasks.\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ldbunw?file=src/app/app.module.ts\r\n\r\nNavigation will be slow when clicking the links.

That library is linked via package.json (local file reference as it is in a mono-repo style git repository). This library is quite large and it takes time for webpack to re-pack it. The contents get put into `vendor.js` as we have `vendorChunk` set to true. It would be nice to be able to have our library be able to be put in its own chunk file so that the vendor chunk rarely ever changes during a release (it is uncommon for us to change other packages during a release).\r\n\r\nWhile this may be possibly using tools like `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` it would be nice to have greater customization of the chunks that are created via the core builder and angular.json.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nNew `additionalChunks` section of angular.json configuration for the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder.\r\nIt would allow glob matching to customize the chunks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"additionalChunks\": {\r\n    \"myLib\": [ \"node_modules/myLib/**\" ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would package the \"myLib\" Angular library as \"myLib.[hash].js\" in the output of ng build (and a separate file for serve)\r\n\r\n### Describe

Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work if the `FocusMonitor` is on a parent element and set up with `checkChildren = true`. This is because the check here (https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966/files#diff-02e96e7ea6a7d8f1caecdfdbb7cb38bdcdc5c43db34e4392723cc48765e330b7R316) fails, as `nativeElement` doesn't have a registered `FocusMonitor`. The `FocusMonitor` is instead registered on the parent.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-un8eee?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open DevTools and watch the classes on `document.body`. There is a `FocusMonitor` attached to the `document.body`.\r\n1. Click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". Note that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is first added, and then 5 seconds later, is replaced by the class `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. This is expected behavior. When this button is clicked, it calls `focusVia` wth `keyboard` origin on the \"Test\" button after 5 seconds.\r\n1. Now, again click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". After clicking, and within 5 seconds, click on the button \"Test\". Now observe that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is present, and never changes to `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. **This is not expected behavior.** I'd expect the class to change to `.cdk-keyboard-focused` due to the fix https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966. Unfortunately it doesn't, because the check `this._elementInfo.has(nativeElement)` fails within `focus-monitor.ts`.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: Latest\r\n- CDK/Material: Latest\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21500","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(FocusMonitor): Focus origin of already focused element doesn't change if FocusMonitor is on parent with checkChildren set to true.\" (#21500)"},{"Id":"778847384","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T18:33:35","Actor":"Neill83","Number":"21494","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): tabs pagination not working when ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush active","State":"closed","Body":"https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lqxupf?file=src/app/tab-nav-bar-basic-example.ts\r\n\r\nI want to get working the pagination when change detection is on push.

While navigating through the list of options, VoiceOver reads out something like \"Coffee, selected (5 of 10)\" for every single option. My first thought was that it might be due to the fact that we remove `aria-selected` from unselected options in order to reduce noise, but the behavior got even weirder once I got it to set `aria-selected=\"false\"`. Now VoiceOver started reading out both \"not selected\" and \"selected\" for each option, e.g. \"Coffee not selected, selected (5 of 10)\". We'll have to investigate this, because I don't see anything obvious that could be causing it. My best bet is that there's a random \"selected\" string somewhere in the DOM that is being picked up by VoiceOver.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21491","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"VoiceOver reads out \"selected\" after each mat-option inside mat-select\" (#21491)"},{"Id":"778222295","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T16:56:51","Actor":"Miguel-Bento-Github","Number":"21490","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update width and height types","State":"closed","Body":"Width and height can be a string, eg: '100%'","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21490","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update width and height types\" (#21490)"},{"Id":"776515176","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T11:08:27","Actor":"donqq","Number":"21481","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(COMPONENT): Strange Dotted Line in Angular Material Documentation ","State":"closed","Body":"I see this strange dotted line in the Angular Material documentation\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JVZUJBe.png\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview\r\nSaw it when the browser window was resized too.

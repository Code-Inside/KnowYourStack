The nature of the connection between these two events is mysterious to me.\r\n\r\nLonger explanation:\r\nI have an `ngForOf` directive that operates over a list of `FormControl` elements, and produces a `<list-item>` view for every one. `ListItem` implements the `ControlValueAccessor` interface, and every `ListItem` is hooked up to its associated `FormControl` element. I have button that, when clicked, deletes one of the `FormControl` elements, and thus causes `ngForOf` to update, removing that control's associated view. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  template: `\r\n<ul>\r\n  <list-item \r\n    *ngFor=\"let control of controls\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"control\"\r\n    (registerOnChangeCalled)=\"changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()\"\r\n    ></list-item>\r\n</ul>\r\n<button (click)=\"controls.splice(0, 1)\">remove first list item</button>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  controls = [new FormControl(), new FormControl()];\r\n\r\n  constructor(private readonly changeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that a `registerOnChangeCalled` event fired from a `<list-Item>` causes `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` to be called.\r\n\r\nMy `ListItem` component is very simple:\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'list-item',\r\n  template: `<li>I am list item</li>`,\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\r\n      useExisting: forwardRef(() => ListItem),\r\n      multi: true,\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nexport class ListItem implements ControlValueAccessor {\r\n  constructor(private readonly changeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {}\r\n  @Output() registerOnChangeCalled = new EventEmitter();\r\n\r\n  registerOnChange(updateModelValue) {\r\n    this.registerOnChangeCalled.emit(null);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  writeValue(modelValue) { /* unimplemented */ }\r\n  registerOnTouched() { /* unimplemented */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this minimal repro example, `registerOnChange` only emits an event to `registerOnChangeCalled`, although in a real app it would do more. `registerOnChange` is a `ControlValueAccessor` method which is called once during the `FormControl` directive initialization,  after `ListItem`'s `ngOnInit` and before its `ngAfterContentInit`.\r\n\r\nWith this setup, clicking the `AppComponent` button causes the following error to be thrown:\r\n```\r\nERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'destroyed')\r\n    at ViewContainerRef_.move (refs.ts:218:17)\r\n    at eval (ng_for_of.ts:244:33)\r\n    at DefaultIterableDiffer.forEachOperation (default_iterable_differ.ts:112:9)\r\n    at NgForOf._applyChanges (ng_for_of.ts:227:13)\r\n    at NgForOf.ngDoCheck (ng_for_of.ts:221:25)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateDirectiveInline (provider.ts:220:15)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateNodeInline (view.ts:442:14)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateNode (view.ts:402:12)\r\n    at debugCheckAndUpdateNode (services.ts:435:44)\r\n    at debugCheckDirectivesFn (services.ts:396:7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I do not call `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`, the error will not be thrown. If I call `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` in `ListItem.ngOnInit` or `ngAfterContentInit`, the error will not be thrown.\r\n\r\nThis is effectively a repro of https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45417, which was closed 12 days ago due to a failure to repro.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-yjdjfe?file=src/app/app.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'destroyed')\r\n    at ViewContainerRef_.move (refs.ts:218:17)\r\n    at eval (ng_for_of.ts:244:33)\r\n    at DefaultIterableDiffer.forEachOperation (default_iterable_differ.ts:112:9)\r\n    at NgForOf._applyChanges (ng_for_of.ts:227:13)\r\n    at NgForOf.ngDoCheck (ng_for_of.ts:221:25)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateDirectiveInline (provider.ts:220:15)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateNodeInline (view.ts:442:14)\r\n    at checkAndUpdateNode (view.ts:402:12)\r\n    at debugCheckAndUpdateNode (services.ts:435:44)\r\n    at debugCheckDirectivesFn (services.ts:396:7)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^12.1.0\",\r\n    \"core-js\": \"^3.15.1\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"^7.1.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.11.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.1100.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.6.0\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~8.3.0\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~6.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.0.2\"\r\n  }\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Calling ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges in child view causes error in parent NgForOf directive\" (#45577)"},{"Id":"1198716197","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-09T17:08:09","Actor":"Michael-Doner","Number":"45576","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add powershell execution policies note","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #44598\r\n\r\nI saw that this issue was open for a long time, so I thought I'd take care of it.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.14.34`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01434)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.33...v0.14.34)\n\nSomething went wrong with the publishing script for the previous release. Publishing again.\n\n### [`v0.14.33`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01433)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.32...v0.14.33)\n\n-   Fix a regression regarding `super` ([#&#8203;2158](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2158))\n\n    This fixes a regression from the previous release regarding classes with a super class, a private member, and a static field in the scenario where the static field needs to be lowered but where private members are supported by the configured target environment. In this scenario, esbuild could incorrectly inject the instance field initializers that use `this` into the constructor before the call to `super()`, which is invalid. This problem has now been fixed (notice that `this` is now used after `super()` instead of before):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      static FOO;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n      #foo;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    var _foo;\n    var Foo = class extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _foo, void 0);\n        super();\n      }\n    };\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    __publicField(Foo, \"FOO\");\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    var _foo;\n    var Foo = class extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        __privateAdd(this, _foo, void 0);\n      }\n    };\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    __publicField(Foo, \"FOO\");\n    ```\n\n    During parsing, esbuild scans the class and makes certain decisions about the class such as whether to lower all static fields, whether to lower each private member, or whether calls to `super()` need to be tracked and adjusted. Previously esbuild made two passes through the class members to compute this information. However, with the new `super()` call lowering logic added in the previous release, we now need three passes to capture the whole dependency chain for this case: 1) lowering static fields requires 2) lowering private members which requires 3) adjusting `super()` calls.\n\n    The reason lowering static fields requires lowering private members is because lowering static fields moves their initializers outside of the class body, where they can't access private members anymore. Consider this code:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      get #foo() {}\n      static bar = new Foo().#foo\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We can't just lower static fields without also lowering private members, since that causes a syntax error:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      get #foo() {}\n    }\n    Foo.bar = new Foo().#foo;\n    ```\n\n    And the reason lowering private members requires adjusting `super()` calls is because the injected private member initializers use `this`, which is only accessible after `super()` calls in the constructor.\n\n-   Fix an issue with `--keep-names` not keeping some names ([#&#8203;2149](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2149))\n\n    This release fixes a regression with `--keep-names` from version 0.14.26. PR [#&#8203;2062](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2062) attempted to remove superfluous calls to the `__name` helper function by omitting calls of the form `__name(foo, \"foo\")` where the name of the symbol in the first argument is equal to the string in the second argument. This was assuming that the initializer for the symbol would automatically be assigned the expected `.name` property by the JavaScript VM, which turned out to be an incorrect assumption. To fix the regression, this PR has been reverted.\n\n    The assumption is true in many cases but isn't true when the initializer is moved into another automatically-generated variable, which can sometimes be necessary during the various syntax transformations that esbuild does. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      static get #foo() { return Foo.name }\n      static get foo() { return this.#foo }\n    }\n    let Bar = Foo\n    Foo = { name: 'Bar' }\n    console.log(Foo.name, Bar.name)\n    ```\n\n    This code should print `Bar Foo`. With `--keep-names --target=es6` that code is lowered by esbuild into the following code (omitting the helper function definitions for brevity):\n\n    ```js\n    var _foo, foo_get;\n    const _Foo = class {\n      static get foo() {\n        return __privateGet(this, _foo, foo_get);\n      }\n    };\n    let Foo = _Foo;\n    __name(Foo, \"Foo\");\n    _foo = new WeakSet();\n    foo_get = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ __name(function() {\n      return _Foo.name;\n    }, \"#foo\");\n    __privateAdd(Foo, _foo);\n    let Bar = Foo;\n    Foo = { name: \"Bar\" };\n    console.log(Foo.name, Bar.name);\n    ```\n\n    The injection of the automatically-generated `_Foo` variable is necessary to preserve the semantics of the captured `Foo` binding for methods defined within the class body, even when the definition needs to be moved outside of the class body during code transformation. Due to a JavaScript quirk, this binding is immutable and does not change even if `Foo` is later reassigned. The PR that was reverted was incorrectly removing the call to `__name(Foo, \"Foo\")`, which turned out to be necessary after all in this case.\n\n-   Print some large integers using hexadecimal when minifying ([#&#8203;2162](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2162))\n\n    When `--minify` is active, esbuild will now use one fewer byte to represent certain large integers:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = 123456787654321;\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    x=123456787654321;\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    x=0x704885f926b1;\n    ```\n\n    This works because a hexadecimal representation can be shorter than a decimal representation starting at around 10<sup>12</sup> and above.\n\n    *This optimization made me realize that there's probably an opportunity to optimize printed numbers for smaller gzipped size instead of or in addition to just optimizing for minimal uncompressed byte count. The gzip algorithm does better with repetitive sequences, so for example `0xFFFFFFFF` is probably a better representation than `4294967295` even though the byte counts are the same. As far as I know, no JavaScript minifier does this optimization yet.

The changes were largely informed by implementing `material/dialog`, `material-experimental/mdc-dialog` and `material/bottom-sheet` using the new API, however the API can be used directly without having to be wrapped. Overview of the changes:\r\n* The classes for the dialog container, dialog config and dialog data aren't provided using DI anymore. The previous approach could've been a problem for apps that use multiple different versions of a CDK-based dialog.\r\n* Several fixes from the Material dialog that were never backported to the CDK version have been incorporated.\r\n* All animations and styles have been removed from the CDK dialog since they were going to be difficult to override by users. Custom animations can be achieved by extending the dialog container class.\r\n* The public API has been cleaned up to avoid some of the issues that were inherited from the Material dialog.\r\n* A demo has been added to the dev app.\r\n\r\nExample of how the new APIs was used to implement the Material components: https://github.com/crisbeto/material2/commit/446a5520f1a0357612a9cc2d9e0c38b506665fb9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24759","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/dialog): rewrite experimental dialog\" (#24759)"},{"Id":"1199133300","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-10T18:25:26","Actor":"Michael-Doner","Number":"24758","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): fix slider jumps back while dragging","State":"open","Body":"Fix a bug in the Angular Material `slider` component where slider jumps back while the user is dragging the slider and the sliders value gets updated manually somewhere else at the same time.\r\n\r\nFixes #19842\r\n\r\nI saw the issue and I thought I'd tackle it, @crisbeto had also worked on it a long time ago, but there was no pull request merged yet if I see it correctly and since then something has changed in the code a bit.

steals the focus back, and the first header of the first tabs becomes the active htmlelement on the page.\r\nTherefor I cannot properly set focus on my input element.\r\n\r\nI am not very familiair

In a simple example it seems to work.\r\n\r\nIn a our application it doens't.\r\n\r\nDifferences are perhaps we have a tabgroup with 2 tabs.

Which triggers moments after we set the focus.\r\nIn the callstack you can see the problem. I just don't know what triggers it..\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect components to not steal focus, or if they do have an event that says 'now i'm done stealing focus'\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nafter all the events of the tabgroup are done, something triggers a focus steal.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material:13.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(tabcontrol): tabcontrol (the header) steals focus since 13.3.0\" (#24748)"},{"Id":"1195498371","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-07T04:18:04","Actor":"ducvu212","Number":"24746","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Cannot use material components inside remote project which created by nx","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have a project which use Microfrontend architecture by NX. \r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAfter i create remote project by command `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:app dashboard --mfe --mfeType=host --routing=true`\r\nInside project dashboard i generate component by using command `nx g c list`\r\nAfter that, i copy example in material home page (https://material.angular.io/components/list/overview#list-overview) but it show error \r\n`error NG8001: 'mat-list-item' is not a known element:\r\n1.

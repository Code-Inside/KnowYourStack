Stackblitz shows the issue with 6.1.9 while the actual project uses 7.2.14.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCSS applied as expected to SVG elements if a template has literal SVG code. If SVG dynamically generated (via a subcomponent), no CSS applied. Please see two simple SVG side-by-side in the provided sample. One features a red circle (explicitly provided) and a red-wannabe (but actually black) when dynamically generated by a child component.\r\n\r\nI have found past issues that mention using _ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom_ as a workaround. Even though this fixes the circle color, it also introduces the disappearance of _FontAwesome < i >_.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, using _ViewEncapsulation.None_ is not an option as it messes with the entire app's CSS.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/css-not-applied-to-svg-circle\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 10.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.8\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.8\r\nrxjs                              6.5.1\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNot browser specific.

wrong value.\r\nThe following code provides ` {prop1:{prop1:\"prop1\",prop2:\"prop2\"},prop2:undefined} ` instead of `{prop1:\"prop1\",prop2:\"prop2\"}`:\r\n```\r\npublic static forRoot(\r\n    {

correctly.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nA minimal reproduction can be found [here](https://github.com/Springrbua/aot-destructuring-bug).\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Execute `ng build --prod`\r\n2. Open `main.*.js` and search for `prop1`. You will find the following Object:  \r\n    `{prop1:{prop1:\"First Property\",prop2:\"Second Property\"},prop2:void 0}`\r\n3. Open `bug.module.ts` and enable the workaround by removing the comment form line 9 and line 16 and putting line 8 and line 15 in comment instead.\r\n4. Run `ng build --prod` again.\r\n5. Open the new `main.*.js` and search for `prop1` again. Now the Object has the correct value  \r\n    `{prop1:\"First Property\",prop2:\"Second Property\"}`\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 10.14.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.8\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.8\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI was looking for this issue and found an article on angular.io, which says that [Destructured variables are not supported in AoT](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#destructured-variable-not-supported).  \r\nI am not sure if this also applies for my example, but if it does, it should probably show an error instead of resulting in a wrong bundle.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14302","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Deconstrucoring and AoT\" (#14302)"},{"Id":"438043128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-28T13:08:40","Actor":"mattlewis92","Number":"14299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 8 injectable pipe migration schematic produces invalid code","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAfter running the v8 schematic it produces invalid code.

This way the `baseUrl` for e2e test run will be created correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the value of `baseUrl` option passed in protractor config could be respected, and concatenated with the calculated host from `publicHost` option. However, this way there is duplicate configuration: base url will be specified both for serve command and for e2e command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, set the serve configuration options as following:\r\n```json\r\n\"options\": {\r\n    \"browserTarget\": \"myapp:build\",\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"/custom-namespace/\",\r\n    \"publicHost\": \"https://localhost/custom-namespace/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `ng e2e`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe browser will open with URL: `https://localhost/` instead of `https://localhost/custom-namespace/`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\nIt seems that my environment is older compared to the latest commit in this repository.

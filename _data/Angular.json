This ensures that Angular never itself\r\nintroduces an import which creates a cycle.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the cycle already exists in the user's program, though, is a\r\nbit different. In these cases, the \"correct\" emit for Angular is to generate\r\nthe component scope (whether direct or remote) inside of a closure, to\r\nprevent evaluating the scope's references until module evaluation is\r\ncomplete and all cyclic imports have been resolved. We don't want to do this\r\nfor *all* scopes because the code size cost of emitting a function wrapper\r\nis non-zero.\r\n\r\nIn this fix, we take the presence of a `forwardRef` in a component's\r\n`imports` or in an NgModule `declarations` or `imports` as a sign that\r\ncomponent scopes emitted into those files need to be protected against\r\ncyclic references. In a future commit, we may introduce a warning or error\r\nif cyclic imports are not protected behind `forwardRef` in these cases, but\r\nthis will take some time to implement.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46139","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): preserve `forwardRef` for component scopes\"

Currently, you would either use a function or a pipe to map the data to a URL. For example, images representing items in a list view for fruits available at a supermarket. I know that, for the inputs, this function will always return the same URL for the fruit in question. An apple will always show an apple, a banana will be a banana, and same with a cherry. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell the change detector that it will always be the same based on inputs. Or, say, it's depending on internal values on a class. Let the change detection know it's directly correlated to certain inputs.\r\n\r\nAs a code example, I have the following class:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Fruit {\r\n  fruit: string\r\n  idFruit: number\r\n\r\n  getFruitUrl() {\r\n    // get me a pic of my fruit based on idFruit\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo use this in a component to render the output of `transformResultToBeHumanReadable`, you would either need to use a pipe that triggers the function, trigger this in a change event and cache the results on the component, or, use the function in the template, at the expense of being rendered multiple times. For multiple little things like this, you end up having to create multiple pipes or variables to cache the data. A declaration either via a function decorator or extended in the component decorator could potentially provide the update cycle with the knowledge of where the function updates, in order to not have to always update.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a set of directives that allow functions to be recognised similar to pipes in terms of update cycle. There could even be bindings to tie update state to individual variables on the class.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class Fruit {\r\n  fruit: string\r\n  idFruit: number\r\n\r\n  @PureFunction({changesOn: [this.idFruit]})\r\n  getFruitUrl() {\r\n    // Only relies on idFruit, so only called when idFruit updates\r\n  }\r\n\r\n @PureFunction()\r\n  getFruitUrl(input: any) {\r\n    // Only relies on input, so only changes if the values being input are different.\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @PureFunction({changesOn: [this.idFruit]})\r\n  getFruitUrl(large?: boolean) {\r\n    // Only relies on both class variables and input variables, so changes when they do.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor add declarations for the functions in the component declaration.\r\n```TypeScript\r\n@Component({\r\n  pureFunctions: [\r\n    {name: \"myFunc\", changesOn: [\"result\"]}\r\n  ]\r\n}) class ObjComponent {\r\n  result;\r\n  myFunc() {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile pipes were designed for this, excessive small pipes that are only needed in one or two places might not be as useful if we can just apply the pipe's change detection strategies to the function. An extension ChangeDetectionStrategy could be used to improve detecting changes if hints are given about how some functions handle change. Again, with the fruit idea, if it relies on only its inputs, and has an output that directly correlates to the input, and won't change its value outside of change detection, like an impure pipe, then it could be able to be considered like a pure Pipe.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46135","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Decorator for class functions to act like pure pipes in terms of update cycle, so can be used in component templates.\" (#46135)"},{"Id":"1247585360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-25T07:03:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"46131","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 4.7 final","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps up the repo to the final version of TypeScript 4.7.

What is `, watch /path/to/file` supposed to mean? Is that an imperative? Are you telling me to watch that file? What do you mean by that? Or does it mean that there were already too many files open _while attempting to_ watch that file (whatever that means)?

[`v14.0.0-rc.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-rc2-2022-05-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-rc.1...14.0.0-rc.2)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### forms\n\n-   The `initialValueIsDefault` option has been deprecated and replaced with the otherwise-identical `nonNullable` option, for the sake of naming consistency.\n-   It is now deprecated to provide *both* `AbstractControlOption`s and an async validators argument to a FormControl. Previously, the async validators would just be silently dropped, resulting in a probably buggy forms. Now, the constructor call is deprecated, and Angular will print a warning in devmode.\n\n##### bazel\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [21a04ef5be](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/21a04ef5be670418b19608227f0540e2b7a96de6) | perf | use allowedInputs to avoid fs.stat ([#&#8203;46069](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/46069)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [f2e5234e07](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f2e5234e078b6d4771d07e8b28b8098f1faeb176) | fix | update unknown tag error for aot standalone components ([#&#8203;45919](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45919)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [701405fa71](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/701405fa710177ed1c963f61686ebb910e5ec74e) | fix | handle AOT-compiled standalone components in TestBed correctly ([#&#8203;46052](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/46052)) |\n| [ddce357d1d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ddce357d1db9694bc69c114deb96e26d2651fb8b) | fix | improve TestBed declarations standalone error message ([#&#8203;45999](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45999)) |\n| [3172b4cc99](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3172b4cc9972a7d347b3078484c9adcb15cf270c) | fix | produce proper error message for unknown props on `<ng-template>`s ([#&#8203;46068](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/46068)) |\n| [4f1a813596](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4f1a813596a40f7885d369eb8917aedcce9dd795) | fix | restore NgModule state correctly after TestBed overrides ([#&#8203;46049](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/46049)) |\n| [df339d8abf](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/df339d8abf979c715c35db813c5a80252a92eba7) | fix | update unknown tag error for jit standalone components ([#&#8203;45920](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45920)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [39be06037d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/39be06037daf65ae9298b5bdb4cd50785c16332f) | fix | Add a `nonNullable` option to `FormControl` for consistency. |\n| [2e96cede3e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2e96cede3e2d9ac399c10d3bfe25259b92a5276e) | fix | Warn on FormControls that are constructed with both options and asyncValidators. |\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\nA.

In fact users that doesn't know about such probably very helpful but optional migrations aren't able to find and execute them.\r\n\r\nOne example for this which can be found at update.angular.io only when selecting 'medium' or 'advanced' option:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng update @angular/cli@12 --migrate-only production-by-default\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdentifying and executing such optional migrations can be tricky if there isn't a way to list/select them.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIdeally during the execution, `ng update` should list the migrations with their default execution state and also include all available optional migrations with a non-preselected state like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> ng update\r\nWhich migrations do you want to execute:\r\n[x] migration1Name: migration1Description\r\n[x] migration2Name: migration1Description\r\n[ ] optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a user made the selection, all selected migrations will be executed including the selected optional ones.\r\nThis will cause a better developer experience as it's more clear what will happen during the update process before actually running the migrations.\r\n\r\nIt should be considered, that tools like renovate or dependabot can't handle such interactive selections.\r\nTherefore a flag could be helpful to deactivate the prompt and switch back to the current behavior (only executing the pre-selected non-optional migrations):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng update --interactive=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs users may have already executed migrations previously or want to know what migrations are available at another point of time, a separate migration command/option could be helpful:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> ng update --list-migrations\r\n- migration1Name: migration1Description\r\n- migration2Name: migration1Description\r\n- optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\r\n\r\nTo execute a migration run: ng update --migrate-only <migration-name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to implement a \"small\" solution that would at least list possible optional migrations at the end of the `ng update` log to give users a hint about possibly further migration they can execute manually\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> ng update\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nFurther optional migrations are available:\r\n\r\n- migration1Name: migration1Description\r\n- migration2Name: migration1Description\r\n- optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\r\n\r\nTo execute a migration run: ng update --migrate-only <migration-name>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"List available migrations and let users choose on `ng update` (including optional migrations)\" (#23205)"},{"Id":"1244964242","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T17:10:27","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"23201","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

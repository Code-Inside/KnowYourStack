When an external template is changed, HMR works like intended and does not cause full application reload. I marked those two templates with a star emoji in the templates.\n\nAbout the reproduction Stackblitz: \n- A counter goes up by 1 for every second without an application reload\n- I made a bunch of components with different permeations of inline or external file templates/styles. \n- Control: One example has no extra class, not even commented out. This works as intended and like the other examples when the extra class is commented out or removed.\n- One example has a component with inline template/styles and then another component class which is used in the template of that file's component. If the inline templates/styles of either are changed, the whole app reloads.\n- edit: with default change detection and using Zone. Unsure if those would change anything but I have done so many permutations already. Though that said, in the v19.1.4 project I found this in, the zone project using `OnPush` change detection had the same issues as this repro's equivalent.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-sct51wue?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.2\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.2\n@angular/build               20.1.2\n@angular/cli                 20.1.2\n@schematics/angular          20.1.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.2\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI initially observed this in a v19.1.4 common / 19.1.5 build project.

However, it's not uncommon for successful requests to return one type and errors to return another type. The current implementation will fail parsing in this case and forward only the resulting `SyntaxError` on `HttpErrorResponse.error`.

This replicates the behavior of the XHR backend introduced in #19773.\r\n\r\nPropagating the plain error allows downstream error consumers to reason about the error body and decide how to parse it depending on application needs.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if you'd consider this breaking. The previous implementation exposed relatively useless `SyntaxError`, but people may be relying on these for some reason?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62765","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(http): propagate plain errors when parsing fails\" (#62765)"},{"Id":"3255304203","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T15:05:23","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"62758","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): resolve component resources before bootstrapping in JIT mode","State":"closed","Body":"Currently if the app has some external resources and it gets bootstrapped in JIT mode, the user will get an error about calling `resolveComponentResources`.

Also one of the (seemingly hiatus) maintainers of the project seems to have had his login leak and pushed malware updates to various projects, however he did not push to stylistic as far as we know.\n\nFrom what we can gather from the current github repo, the package is in fact not currently having malware. At least not 0.64.0, which was the last version published before it got taken down. So if you think its fine you can try one of these workarounds mentioned in the github issue. Its at least good to see that one of the maintainers still has access to the github and that it currently looks good to use, however there isn't a npm package published yet.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\nNPM: https://github.com/stylus/stylus/issues/2938#issuecomment-3106151553\n\nPNPM and Yarn (the NPM doesn't work as of now): https://github.com/stylus/stylus/issues/2938#issuecomment-3105993298\n\nIt seems odd to me that the package was outright removed and that this has a big influence (since Vite is pretty damn popular), so this will likely not be the end of it. But I wanted to post here in case more folks saw their CI/CD going down this morning or have other issues related to the library. Lets use this as a discussion on how we can improve the system and see whether we need a better look at the whole dependency tree of Angular to make sure it can't just be taken down like this. Especially now that AI can be wrongly flagging stuff and with the amount of stuff that gets flagged, its also hard to really test everything properly, so I totally get that it happened.\n\nAlso relevant: \n\nhttps://github.com/github/advisory-database/issues/5846\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20461\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThe issue is a work in progress. There are a few workarounds if you trust that the current github repo doesn't have issues.\n\nBut please make sure to not use the head version, but set it to either 0.59.0 or 0.64.0 so that you are more safe to know what is going to be part of your project.\n\nRight now its used like so:\n\n```\n┬ @angular/build 20.1.1 peer\n├─┬ @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl 2.1.0\n      │ └─┬ vite 7.0.0 peer\n

*/\n```\n\nAs you can see `userRoutes` depends on `authGuard` to be set however it's declared later in the chunk file leading to the angular router throwing an Exception because undefined was passed instead of a canActivate guard.\n\nThis is an abbreviated version of the original source file:\n```ts\nimport { Routes as NgRoutes } from '@angular/router';\nimport { authGuard } from '../../shared/guards/auth-guard';\n\nexport const USER_ROUTES_PREFIX = 'user';\n\nexport const UserRoutes = {\n  PROFILE: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'profile'],\n  SETTINGS: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'settings'],\n};\n\nexport const userRoutes: NgRoutes = [\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.PROFILE.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-profile-page/user-profile-page').then(m => m.UserProfilePage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.SETTINGS.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-settings-page/user-settings-page').then(m => m.UserSettingsPage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nAs you can see it's being imported correctly and should therefore be declared before the user routes in the chunk file.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

It occurred on my previous Windows laptop and my new M4 MacBook Pro.\n\nCrucially, building the exact same type of project with Angular CLI 17.x works perfectly.\n\nReproduction Steps:\n\n1. Ensure a clean environment: This issue occurs even on a system with a fresh Node.js and npm installation (no previous global Angular CLI or project dependencies).\n\n2. Install Angular CLI 20.1.1 globally:\n\n`npm install -g @angular/cli@20.1.1`\n\n3. Create a new Angular project with SSR enabled:\n\n```\nng new my-ssr-app --ssr\ncd my-ssr-app\n```\n\n4. Attempt to build the SSR application:\n\n`ng build --ssr`\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe ng build --ssr command should complete successfully, generating the SSR bundles without errors, as it does with Angular 17.x.\n\nActual Behavior:\nThe build fails with the following error:\n\n```\n/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/rxjs/dist/cjs/internal/util/reportUnhandledError.js:13\n            throw err;\n            ^\n\nError: The \"ssr.entry\" option is required when \"outputMode\" is set to \"server\".\n    at normalizeOptions (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/options.js:117:19)\n    at async buildApplicationInternal (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/index.js:47:31)\n    at async buildApplication (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/index.js:122:22)\n    at async handleAsyncIterator (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/src/api.js:38:28)\n\nNode.js v22.17.1\n```\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/BenGoldberg/test-srr-app\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/rxjs/dist/cjs/internal/util/reportUnhandledError.js:13\n            throw err;\n            ^\n\nError: The \"ssr.entry\" option is required when \"outputMode\" is set to \"server\".\n    at normalizeOptions (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/options.js:117:19)\n    at async buildApplicationInternal (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/index.js:47:31)\n    at async buildApplication (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/application/index.js:122:22)\n    at async handleAsyncIterator (/Users/ben/Documents/GitHub/test-srr-app/node_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/src/api.js:38:28)\n\nNode.js v22.17.1\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.1\nNode: 22.17.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.1.2\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-server, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.1\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.1\n@angular/build               20.1.1\n@angular/cli                 20.1.1\n@angular/ssr                 20.1.1\n@schematics/angular          20.1.1\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAs you can see in the angular.json file in the project the ssr.entry section is not missing!!

In some cases, the focus visible is activated; in others, it is not, despite seemingly identical interaction patterns.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/evu9vvms?file=src%2Findex.html\n(This is the official Angular CDK context menu example — the issue is reproducible there.)\n\nVideo demonstration:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f7269f-3378-4328-b012-dc7b4f7f9c0f\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Open the [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/evu9vvms?file=src%2Findex.html) or the official Angular CDK context menu docs.\n2. Interact with the context menu trigger multiple times using right-click\n\nObserved behavior:\n\nThe focus ring sometimes appears and sometimes does not, even though the menu opens the same way.\n\nIt seems that clicking other examples in the docs makes it easier to reproduce the issue, as shown in the video.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe visibility of the focus ring on the first focusable item in the context menu should be deterministic and consistent across identical interactions.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n the focus ring on the first focusable element appears inconsistently\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1.0\n- CDK/Material: 20.1.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome 138.0.7204.158\n- Operating System: macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31586","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/context-menu): inconsistent focus ring visibility on menu open\" (#31586)"},{"Id":"3256621621","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T14:31:14","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31585","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-next.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31585","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-next.1\" with changelog.\" (#31585)"},{"Id":"3256567117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T14:26:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31584","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.3 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31584","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.3 release\" (#31584)"},{"Id":"3256563615","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T14:13:00","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31583","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31583","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.3\" with changelog.\" (#31583)"},{"Id":"3256503959","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T14:06:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31582","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: broken lock file in patch branch","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the lock file in the patch branch was out of sync.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31582","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: broken lock file in patch branch\" (#31582)"},{"Id":"3254885732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T06:57:16","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31581","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency firebase-tools to v14.11.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [firebase-tools](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | devDependencies | patch | [`14.11.0` -> `14.11.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/14.11.0/14.11.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.11.1`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.11.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.11.0...v14.11.1)\n\n- Added a deprecation warning for functions.config() to stderr on deploy and all functions:config commands.

However, this creates problems regarding WCAG compliance and accessibility.\n\nAccording to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), **tree structures can be used for page navigation** as demonstrated in the [Treeview Navigation Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/). The guidelines specify that:\n\n1. `aria-current=\"page\"` should be used (instead of `aria-selected`) to indicate the current page\n2. Navigation should be implemented using `<a>` tags\n\nAngular Material however enforces this default role structure:\nmat-tree → role=\"tree\"\nmat-nested-tree-node → role=\"treeitem\"\n\n...there is an issue when trying to use semantically correct links (`<a>` tags) within `<mat-nested-tree-node>` – for example, with aria-current=\"page\".\n\nWhen we intend to use the `<mat-tree>` component as a recursive tree-based site navigation, the question becomes how to correctly integrate and semantically mark up an `<a>` tag. Ideally, the `<a>` tag itself should receive the role=\"treeitem\" and the aria-current=\"page\" attribute when it represents the current page.\n\nCurrently, it's unclear to us how the `<mat-tree>` component can be extended to meet this specific requirement for web links.\n\nRemoving the `<a>` tag and replacing it with manual navigation (this.router.navigate()) is not an option due to synchronization problems etc.\n\nThe following code snippet shows our current approach:\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"treeDataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\" class=\"nested-tree\">\n  <mat-nested-tree-node [attr.aria-current]=\"linkActive.isActive ? 'page' : null\"\n    *matTreeNodeDef=\"let item; when: hasChild\">\n    <div\n      class=\"mat-tree-node\"\n      matTreeNodeToggle\n      routerLinkActive=\"menu-nav--highlighted\"\n      [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\"\n      #linkActive=\"routerLinkActive\">\n        <button mat-mini-fab color=\"light\" [attr.aria-label]=\"'toggle ' + item.title\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n          <mat-icon [svgIcon]=\"treeControl.isExpanded(item) ? 'arrow-down-20' : 'arrow-right-20'\">\n          </mat-icon>\n        </button>\n      <a\n        class=\"menu-nav__link tree-node-link\"\n        [routerLink]=\"item.route\"\n        tabindex=\"-1\"\n        [attr.aria-label]=\"item.title\"\n        [attr.title]=\"item.title\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        (click)=\"onNodeToggle($event, item)\">\n        {{ item.title }}\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div [ngClass]=\"{ hidden: !treeControl.isExpanded(item) }\" role=\"group\">\n      <ng-container matTreeNodeOutlet></ng-container>\n    </div>\n  </mat-nested-tree-node>\n</mat-tree>\n```\nI would appreciate an official way or best practice to semantically implement accessible links with aria-current inside the **mat-tree** pattern.\n\nThank you in advance for any feedback or proposed solutions!\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nA way to configure **mat-tree** so that:\n\n1. Links are correctly identified as treeitem\n2. aria-current=\"page\" can be set for the current page\n3.

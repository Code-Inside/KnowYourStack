I probably did something wrong with my routes configuration. But here is my problem:\r\n\r\nI've got this route configuration:\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [    \r\n    {\r\n        path: \"webspaces/:webSpaceName\",\r\n        title: \"Web Spaces\",\r\n        children: [\r\n            {\r\n                path: \"\",\r\n                redirectTo: \"login\",\r\n                pathMatch: \"full\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                path: 'login',\r\n                title: 'Login',\r\n                canActivate: [isAuthenticatedGuard],\r\n                component: LoginComponent\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                path: 'dashboard',\r\n                title: 'Dashboard',\r\n                canActivate: [isAuthenticatedGuard],\r\n                component: DashboardComponent\r\n            },\r\n        ]\r\n    },    \r\n    //otherwise redirect to home\r\n    { path: '**', component: HomeComponent}\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I want an url structured this way : /webspaces/:webSpaceName/login or /dashboard. I used an empty child route to redirect to login component. If I type /webspaces/**WS1** everything works correctly an I'm redirected to the login component and once logged in to dashboard component without any issue. But if I try to type the url directly in the browser like so : /webspaces/**WS1**/login, the url is automatically rewritten in lowercase as /webspaces/**ws1**/login which can be problematic on my project where the parameter is case sensitive.\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm currently only on local dev environment accessing the app by localhost.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nA children url is rewritten as lowercase when accessed directly by typing it in the browser navigation bar.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.7\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53859","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Url rewritten in lowercase when accessing child route without redirect\" (#53859)"},{"Id":"2073268653","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T22:30:53","Actor":"atscott","Number":"53860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"refactor(router): Update integration tests to cover navigatio…","State":"closed","Body":"…n and history API (#53799)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit eb2e879a008adebe11d63f42799570ba4f053c52.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53860","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"refactor(router): Update integration tests to cover navigatio…\" (#53860)"},{"Id":"2071841369","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T20:28:02","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"53845","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): generate less code for advance instructions","State":"closed","Body":"We generate `advance` instructions before most update instructions and the majority of `advance` calls are advancing by one.

I want any values coming out of the Observable to be set on a Signal. So this is how I set it up:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// any used here since the type doesn't really matter in this example\r\nreadonly position = signal<any>(undefined);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npositionStrategy.positionChanges\r\n      .pipe(tap(console.log))\r\n      .subscribe((x) => this.position.set(x));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI display a value in the template derived from this signal, for example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>Position: {{position() | json}}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the Observable (`positionChanges`) emits a value, I see the value output to `console.log`, but in the template, nothing is rendered for `position()`. I would expect since the `position()` signal is referenced in the template, that whenever the value is changed, the template would re-render. I also tried referencing the value in a `computed`, but it still doesn't update.\r\n\r\nI did finally find one way to get it to update. Put the following code into the `constructor`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\neffect(() => this.position());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it renders to the view as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPosition: { \"connectionPair\": { \"originX\": \"center\", \"overlayX\": \"center\", \"originY\": \"top\", \"overlayY\": \"bottom\" }, \"scrollableViewProperties\": { \"isOriginClipped\": false, \"isOriginOutsideView\": false, \"isOverlayClipped\": false, \"isOverlayOutsideView\": false } }\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hwrgyh?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.9\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.9\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.9\r\nng-packagr                      17.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53841","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Change detection not triggered when Signal.set() called from Observable subscription\" (#53841)"},{"Id":"2071277787","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-08T21:48:31","Actor":"alejandrocuba","Number":"53842","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add alejandrocuba to GDE resources","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

When running the command 'ng build' parts of my code get removed.\r\n\r\nIn my development library environnement (BUG): \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error:\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/carousel-library and npm i\r\n2.  (optional) Run 'ng serve -o'. Everything works as expected in development (nothing has been removed).\r\n3. Run 'ng build'\r\n![find folder dist](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/69f145b0-9849-45f8-8cad-4bc782789e39)\r\nFind the corresponding file in the compiled code in the dist folder and search for the method 'resetViewLeftDirection'. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;', which is necessary for forcing element reflow, has been removed.\r\n\r\nIn a existing project (BUG):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/Portfolio and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz (winrar) at root .\r\n2. Have a look at the ngx-carousel-ease in the node_modules/fesm2022/ngx-carousel-ease.mjs.map. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n![inside node_modules](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/2606ab3b-67b9-426b-abcc-3138681e8e0f)\r\n3. Now run 'ng build' and find the corresponding file in the dist folder: \r\n![last line gone](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/faeee759-e62a-4f73-9f4e-c8e5ff11f1a4)\r\n'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' has been removed in the compiled code.\r\n\r\nIn a new project (WORKING):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/lib-carousel and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz at root .\r\n2. Run ng build\r\n3. Have a look at the corresponding compiled file in the dist folder. The 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why this is working in a new project, and not in my developement environnement nor in an existing project. I don't know if it's a regression bug. I expect it to be a configuration problem. I've tried to get the same tsconfig from the working project in not working ones, but was unable to find the problem. \r\n\r\nWhen shipped to npm, the code includes the missing lines. When running 'ng build'  this line got removed. Is this some aggressive optimisation from ng build ? If this line got removed, it is totally possible that other part of the application get removed by ng build as well.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26825","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Severe] V17: ng-build removes part of library author code\" (#26825)"},{"Id":"2072911445","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:20:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26824","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: update dependency webpack-dev-middleware to v7\"","State":"closed","Body":"Reverts angular/angular-cli#26760","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26824","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: update dependency webpack-dev-middleware to v7\"\" (#26824)"},{"Id":"2072768259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:58:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26821","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove daily CI run for v14.x","State":"closed","Body":"Angular v14 is EOL.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove daily CI run for v14.x\" (#26821)"},{"Id":"2072759553","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:58:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26820","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove daily CI run for v13.x","State":"closed","Body":"Angular v13 is EOL.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove daily CI run for v13.x\" (#26820)"},{"Id":"2071694887","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:43:45","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26817","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.23.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | minor | `v3.22.12` -> `v3.23.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.23.0`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.22.12...v3.23.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.22.12...v3.23.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, this is not what happens, in fact my local api does not get any of these requests at all.

Documentation says this is optional but code makes it required as reported in https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26270.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the mat-tab-nav-bar is wrapped in some other component, e.g. an AppHeaderComponent, but the MatTabNavPanel is outside this component, we need to pass the reference to the MatTabNavPanel via Input into the wrapper component like AppHeaderComponent and then use it in the template. This is the only way I can think of, but it throws a ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError (quite obvious for everyone who understand Angular's CD resolution algorithm really good, but hard to understand for everyone else), for example \r\n\r\n> ERROR Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked.

Typing changes into the input _does not_ fire the observable. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatAutocomplete): When setting `MatAutocomplete.requireSelection = true`  and using the `MatAutocomplete.displayWith` input parameter, the `MatInput`'s `FormControl.valueChanges` observable does not emit values on text input, only on value selection\" (#28378)"},{"Id":"2067437291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T14:31:40","Actor":"maxime1992","Number":"28377","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe code I've got:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    importProvidersFrom(MatDialogModule),\r\n    {\r\n      provide:APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi:true,\r\n      useFactory: (dialog:MatDialog) => {\r\n        dialog.open(DialogComponent, {\r\n          data: {\r\n            helloWorld: true,\r\n          },\r\n        });\r\n        return () => true\r\n      },\r\n      deps:[MatDialog]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my dialog component looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./dialog.component.css'],\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule],\r\n})\r\nexport class DialogComponent {\r\n  @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public dialogData: any;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log({ dialogData: this.dialogData }); // this is always `undefined`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hbwckt?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nThen look at the console or the view where I've put a `| json` to debug.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBeing able to access the data passed to a dialog.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nData is always undefined.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `17.0.8`\r\n- CDK/Material: `17.0.4`\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined\" (#28377)"},{"Id":"2067068880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T10:06:24","Actor":"webmichelle","Number":"28376","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-progress-spinner): stroke-width of svg circle not calculated properly for some diameter + strokeWidth values","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe `circle` element of the `mat-progress-spinner`'s SVG does not fill up to the whole space of it's container.

This means these two components never get the same height regardless the density applied.\r\n\r\nIn case they are used next to each other, when Tabs are used as kind of a 'toolbar' on a screen, it causes a visual discrepancy. Here is a demonstration where default 0 density is used for Tabs and -3 density used for Toolbars:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/egbtbh?file=src%2Ftheme.scss\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/15703819/605962a4-0db7-40cf-832a-7bec85e248fc)\r\n\r\nThis may look as a tiny problem, but the Design, Business or QA departments may have very attentive eyes and report this as a visual bug (as it happened in my team). I am trying to avoid changing the heights with some custom CSS as this is not an approach recommended by Angular Material team as per this section in the official docs: https://material.angular.io/guide/customizing-component-styles#targeting-custom-styles\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/15703819/534edb36-b9a9-4043-a112-2a3f8c22fa1c)\r\n\r\nTherefore my question is, would it be please possible to add more density scale levels for either Tabs or Toolbar and still be compliant to the Material Design specs? Or maybe the whole use case of having Tabs next to a Toolbar is not correct from the Material Design specs point of view and I should ask our Design department to fix the designs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28371","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(Toolbar & Tabs): support more density scale levels in Toolbar or Tabs\" (#28371)"},{"Id":"2065410525","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-04T20:39:04","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28366","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tabs): enable hydration","State":"closed","Body":"Adds a workaround that allows us to enable hydration in the tab group component.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28366","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tabs): enable hydration\" (#28366)"},{"Id":"2065186368","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-04T16:33:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28364","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-date-fns-adapter): support date-fns 3.0","State":"closed","Body":"Adds support for `date-fns` 3 to the date adapter.\r\n\r\nFixes #28357.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28364","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material-date-fns-adapter): support date-fns 3.0\" (#28364)"},{"Id":"2065940659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-04T16:16:09","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28368","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): safari value correction bug","State":"open","Body":"* Fixes an issue where the slider value would sometimes not get immediately corrected on pointerdown in safari.\r\n* This bug only gets triggered when the user triggers a user begins dragging directly on the hidden native inputs slider thumb.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28368","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): safari value correction bug\" (#28368)"},{"Id":"2065465484","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-04T11:56:38","Actor":"vartikaagrawal411","Number":"28367","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue in Material/Select with ngx-scrollbar","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI need to use ngx scrollbar inside mat select component.

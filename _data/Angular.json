Without cache? This currently becomes reality for VDOM based frameworks like vue & react.\r\n\r\nWith angular it's not that easy, as the framework is basicly a compiler.\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\nFaster compiler.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPretty sure the angular team loves performance and compiler stuff. So I just wanna see what you think about this.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two typescript to javascript compilers in development:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild (written in go)\r\nhttps://github.com/swc-project/swc (written in rust)\r\n\r\nIn the wild:\r\nesbuild is used by [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) - maybe the next official bundler for vue 3\r\nswc is used by [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) - a secure alternative to node.js, which natively understands typescript files\r\n\r\nThe performance is pretty remarkable. The performance gains are in the 100x ballpark. So if your typical webpack + loader written in javascript builds something in 50s, these two do the same in 500ms! So the current javascript based approaches clearly are bottlenecking in what V8 is capable of.\r\n\r\nWe switched our jest unit tests from ts-jest to swc-jest and the runtime went down from 50s to 11s - pretty much just the compute of executing the suite itself is left, the compile effort nearly disappears. Of course the tests run in JIT mode. If we had an angular compiler that fast, this could be even more swift.\r\n\r\nswc in particular may be interesting for angular, as the deno team right now tries to boost the typescript performance if they can just generate the AST via swc. Maybe you could do something similar. Get the AST from swc.\r\n\r\nOf course you are google. Maybe V8 just needs some optimizations for parsers. Sure thats not important for browser performance. But so much of the javascript tooling right now relies on V8. If rust or go can do the same task in a 1/100 of the time, there clearly seems to be some low hanging fruit.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38732","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feature request - faster compiler\" (#38732)"},{"Id":"694907480","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T09:26:22","Actor":"tirithen","Number":"38730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make Angular componets exportable to Web Components by default","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe company I work for wants to reuse Angular custom UI components that is built by another team in a larger project I'm working in. The project I'm a part of uses standard web components with some basic helpers through lit-html/lit-element.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it's hard with Angular to use only a single component outside the Angular \"engine\". Does the Angular project have a roadmap on when the Angular components will be usable outside an all-in Angular app? It would probably help preventing large code re-writes as when AngularJS became Angular as web components using different helpers could then coexist, during migration as well as for the lifespan of a project. Much like the packages in the Node.js world where basically any package could be used separately from another.\r\n\r\nDo you have a roadmap for this, when would it be available? \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe possibility to export any pre-existing Angular component as a standard web component ([customElements.define](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define)) without internal custom modification.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAngular elements, it seems like great start for this approach, but as I understood when talking to the team developing the custom Angular components they would have to re-write the components to make it possible to export them.\r\n\r\nI understand that currently might be the case for a project that started without a thought on exporting their components, but what if the Angular API/syntax was designed as such that the default and only way to create the components was one where they could always be exported.\r\n\r\nSurely that would also help reduce the need for complete re-writes when the next major Angular release comes along as was the case from AngularJS to Angular.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make Angular componets exportable to Web Components by default\" (#38730)"},{"Id":"694547164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T22:10:11","Actor":"bsmith418","Number":"38728","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add template reference variable for FormArrays","State":"open","Body":"One can self-reference forms as so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<form #thisForm=\"ngForm\">\r\n  Yay I can see myself: {{  thisForm.value | json }}\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no way to refer to FormArrays within the form.

Most of the time this is fine, because the logic that escapes the rule content to `%BLOCK%` will have converted it to something that won't be matched by the regex. However, it breaks down for rules like `@import` which don't have a body, but can still have quoted content with characters that can match the regex.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by making a second pass over the escaped string and replacing all of the remaining quoted content with `%QUOTED%` before parsing it with the regex. Once everything has been processed, we make a final pass where we restore the quoted content.\r\n\r\nIn a previous iteration of this PR, I went with a shorter approach which narrowed down the regex so that it doesn't capture rules without a body. It fixed the issue, but it also ended up breaking some of the more contrived unit test cases.

We‚Äôre proposing to offer an out-of-the-box solution with little or no configuration needed.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nCSS files are [render-blocking](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css) because the browser must download and parse these files before starting to render the page. This makes CSS files a bottleneck when they are large or when having poor or limited network connectivity. Each of these files will result in a penalty on the Performance Score of your application (angular/angular-cli/issues/17966).\r\n\r\nWe can reduce this render-blocking time and at the same time improve the [first contentful paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/) (FCP) by extracting and inlining the critical CSS and loading the CSS files asynchronously.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n## Load CSS files asynchronously\r\n\r\nIn most cases JavaScript bundles will take a longer time to download, parse than for Angular to bootstrap and start rendering the first component thus the chance of having Flash of unstyled content (FOUC) is relatively low. \r\n\r\nWe are proposing to introduce an experimental async CSS loading use the ‚Äú**media**‚Äù technique which can be opted-in/out via an option angular.json\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" media=\"only x\" onload=\"this.media='all'\">\r\n<noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"></noscript>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CSS files budgets\r\nCSS files are great for code-sharing, but other than that they are a bottleneck to achieving great performance. Two of the main reasons for this is that they are render blocking and might contain dead-rules. \r\n\r\nSince a CSS file is not strictly associated with the components loaded on the page, a number of CSS declarations that get downloaded and parsed will remain unused by the view that was rendered.\r\n\r\nHaving render blocking and/or dead-rules will cause performance score penalties in Lighthouse.\r\n\r\nWe propose to add two new bundle budgets allStyle and anyStyle:\r\n\r\n- **anyStyle**: any given external CSS files\r\n- **allStyle**: cumulative size of all external CSS files.\r\n\r\n## Inline Google Fonts and Icons\r\nWe are proposing to introduce an experimental optimization for fonts which can be opted-in/out via an option in angular.json.\r\n\r\nDuring build time we will parse the index.html, download the content of stylesheets originating from `https://fonts.googleapis.com/‚Ä¶` and inline their content.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the extra round trip that the browser has to make to fetch the font declarations, which improves LCP, reduces FOUC, and also unlike other approaches doesn't prohibit Angular applications from taking full advantage of `font-display: optional`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\">\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  @font-face {\r\n    font-family: 'Material Icons';\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/materialicons/v55/flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-Vdg-IuiaDsNcIhQ8tQ.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .material-icons {\r\n    font-family: 'Material Icons';\r\n    font-weight: normal;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-size: 24px;\r\n    line-height: 1;\r\n    letter-spacing: normal;\r\n    text-transform: none;\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    white-space: nowrap;\r\n    word-wrap: normal;\r\n    direction: ltr;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case the application needs to support Internet Explorer 11 which will be determined via the [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration, the `woff1` definition of the font will also be inlined.\r\n\r\n## Extract Critical CSS\r\nThe most generic which requires zero to no configuration from the developer is to inline critical CSS as a post-rendering step using existing projects such as: [penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse), [critters](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters) and [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical). \r\n\r\nThe above mentioned tools take different approaches to extract critical CSS. The approach that **Critters** uses is the best fit for our use cases. The main reason for this is that Critters doesn‚Äôt use a headless browser but uses a JavaScript DOM (JSDOM) to render the page content which makes it faster compared to the other tools and hence it makes it valuable to be used as a build time and runtime option. The main trade-off of this is that it doesn't predict the viewport and inlines all the CSS declarations used by the document.\r\n\r\n### SSR\r\nIn Angular Universal SSR we cannot use Critters directly because this is a Webpack plugin and rendering of Angular Universal pages for both dynamic and static applications happens outside of the Webpack build. Therefore, a more decoupled version of Critters core functionality would be needed.\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôll run Critters during runtime. When a request hits the server and the Angular SSR page is rendered, we will run Critters as a post-rendering phase to extract the critical CSS and inline in the final HTML response.\r\n\r\n### App-Shell & Pre-rendering\r\nAs a post-rendering phase during build time, we‚Äôll run Critters to extract the critical CSS of the rendered page and inline the contents in the HTML document.\r\n\r\n### CSP\r\nIn Angular CSP, we cannot extract and inline CSS because we are unable to run it in a Node.Js environment, However, it is common for CSP‚Äôs to have a custom loading experience outside of Angular context defined in the index.html file. Therefore, we are proposing to extract and inline CSS for this use case to reduce the risk of FOUC even further.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nBelow are some alternatives that we have considered but deemed less useful / less feasible compared to the main proposal.\r\n\r\n## Annotating critical CSS\r\nAnnotating critical CSS with a comment and tools such as [postcss-critical-split](https://github.com/mrnocreativity/postcss-critical-split#readme) will extract these into a separate file which can later be inlined.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* critical:start */\r\nheader {\r\n  background-color: #1d1d1d;\r\n  font-size: 2em;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.aside {\r\n  text-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n/* critical:end */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe drawback of this is that It will be up to the developer to determine which CSS declarations are critical or not. Developers will also not be able to annotate critical styles which are not part of the application such as when depending on a vendored UI framework library such as Material, Bootstrap etc...\r\n\r\nHence this approach is more complex, has a bigger learning curve and is error prone.\r\n\r\n## Using headless browsers based extractors\r\n[Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse) is a critical CSS extractor and can do so for non SSR‚Äôd applications. This is because under the hood it uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to generate the critical CSS.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this is that this approach will be different from what‚Äôs proposed for Angular Universal and is slower. \r\n\r\n## Include CSS files in app root component\r\nAnother approach would be to include the global styles in the app root component.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n selector: 'app-root',\r\n templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n styleUrls: [\r\n   './styles.css',\r\n   './app.component.css',\r\n ],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this is that the entire contents of **styles.css** will be inlined in the HTML page when using Angular Universal or App shell.\r\n\r\n## DNS-Prefetch and Preconnect Hints\r\nAdd [dns-prefetch and preconnect hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch) for  for `https://fonts.gstatic.com` to initiate DNS resolution and a connection.\r\n\r\n# Additional Resources\r\n- https://web.dev/vitals/\r\n- https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch/\r\n- https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters/\r\n- https://web.dev/preload-optional-fonts/\r\n- https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/\r\n- https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n- Should these features be on opt-in or opt-out bases?\r\n- Should we add the bundle budgets to existing applications?

Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/postcss-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;400-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribpostcss-loadercomparev300v400-2020-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0)\n\n##### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   minimum supported `Node.js` version is `10.13`\n-   minimum supported `webpack` version is `4`\n-   `postcss` was moved to `peerDependencies`, you need to install `postcss`\n-   `PostCSS` (`plugins`/`syntax`/`parser`/`stringifier`) options was moved to the `postcssOptions` option, please look at [docs](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#postcssoptions)\n-   `sourceMap` default value depends on the `compiler.devtool` option\n-   the `inline` value was removed for the `sourceMap` option, please use `{ map: { inline: true, annotation: false } }` to achieve this\n-   source maps contain absolute paths in `sources`\n-   loader output only CSS, so you need to use `css-loader`/`file-loader`/`raw-loader` to inject code inside bundle\n-   `exec` option was renamed to the `execute` option\n-   the `config` option doesn't support `Object` type anymore, `config.path` and `config.ctx` options were removed\n-   argument in the config for `Function` notation (previously `config.ctx`) was changed, now it contains `{ file, mode, webpackLoaderContext }`\n-   loader context in the config was renamed from `webpack` to `webpackLoaderContext`\n\n##### Features\n\n-   message API for emit assets ([#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/443)) ([e966ab9](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/e966ab965132ca812cb50e5eaf7df5fc2ad9c137))\n-   reuse AST from other loaders ([#&#8203;468](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/468)) ([9b75888](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/9b75888dff4957f2ef1e94eca871e329354a9f6d))\n-   allows to use config and loader options together, options from the loader takes precedence over the config, the `plugins` option from the config and options are merged ([0eb5aaf](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/0eb5aaf3d49f6d5e570a3c3fdb6b201487e503c7))\n-   `postcssOptions` options can be `Function`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   compatibility with webpack@5 ([#&#8203;437](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/437)) ([ed50491](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/ed504910b70b4d8b4d77084c19ad92330676433e))\n-   `default` export for plugins ([#&#8203;465](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/465)) ([3d32c35](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/3d32c35c5c911d6bd25dc0c4b5b3cd11408632d7))\n-   avoid mutations of loader options and config ([#&#8203;470](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/470)) ([cad6f07](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/cad6f07c7f4923e8ef69ecb402b10bbd08d09530))\n-   respect the `map` option from loader options and config ([#&#8203;458](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/458)) ([98441ff](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/98441ff87e51b58e9322d1bebb5eefc5ba417e24))\n\n##### Notes\n\n-   you don't need `ident` option for loader\n-   `Object` syntax for the `plugin` option is soft deprecated, please migrate on `Array` syntax (`plugins: ['postcss-present-env', ['cssnano', options]]`)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date:

For accessibility reasons we still want to link the `label` with the underlying `FormControl`. To do so, we need to remove the attribute reflection on the Host element to prevent having multiple Ids on the page.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// This code prevents the attribute reflection of the Id attribute into the DOM\r\n@HostBinding('attr.id') null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that this breaks the lookup via `selector` on the base options. We would need to change the lookup to check the `FormControl` instead of the `Host`.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could provide custom `HarnessFilters`. But then we would need to rename the `options`. It would be nice if we could override or disable the base options. Disabling or overriding the base options would allow us to keep a consistent interface throughout all components in our UI framework. Basically every `Harness` object would always provide the `selector` plus maybe something additional.\r\n\r\n#### Possible solutions / approaches\r\n\r\nPass in custom match function\r\n\r\n*The HarnessPredicate could accept a custom match function*\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  constructor(public harnessType: ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>, \r\n  \t\t     options: BaseHarnessFilters,\r\n                     matchFunction?: ((option: BaseHarnessFilters) => Promise<boolean>) | null) \r\n{  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOption to disable the base functions and then use the addOption to provide them yourself\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  constructor(public harnessType: ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>, \r\n  \t\t      options: BaseHarnessFilters,\r\n                      disableBaseFunctions = false)\r\n  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand then inside our Harness implementation:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n static with(options: BaseHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<CustomHarness> {\r\n    return new HarnessPredicate(CustomHarness, options).addOption(\r\n      'custom selector option',\r\n      options.selector,\r\n      async (harness: CustomHarness, selector: string) => {\r\n        if (selector.startsWith('#')) {\r\n          const inputField = await harness.getInputFieldElement();\r\n          console.log(`#${inputField.getAttribute('id')}` === selector);\r\n          return HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(\r\n            `#${inputField.getAttribute('id')}`,\r\n            selector\r\n          );\r\n        }\r\n        return (await harness.host()).matchesSelector(selector);\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of those proposed solutions.

The new select is functionally identical to the current one since both are implemented on top of the same base class, but they have the following differences:\r\n* The logic that tries to position the selected option on top of the trigger has been removed from the MDC version. Now we only position the panel above or below, depending on the available space.\r\n* Since we don't have to deal with the panel positioning logic anymore, we can now allow the text of `mat-option` to wrap to multiple lines inside the MDC version.\r\n* The animations of the MDC version are simplified to mimic the ones from `mat-menu`, because the previous animations were tightly coupled to the old overlay positioning logic.\r\n\r\nAside from the new select, this PR includes the following fixes:\r\n* The `MatOptionSelectionChange.source` is now typed to the generic `_MatOptionBase` rather than the non-MDC implementation. This was an oversight when the base class was first implemented.\r\n* Uses `min-height` instead of `height` for the MDC `mat-option` in order to handle multi-line text better.\r\n* Adds the `mat-form-field-hide-placeholder`, `mat-form-field-appearance-outline` and `mat-form-field-appearance-fill` classes which were missing from the MDC form field. They're necessary so that the select can be styled to look correctly across all supported use cases.\r\n* The dev app for the select has been reorganized to emphasize `mat-select`, instead of `mat-form-field` with a native `select`. I've also cleaned up the styles so everything aligns better and is nicer to look at.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I'll add the test harness as a follow-up since the PR is fairly large already.\r\n\r\n![Angular_Material_-_Google_Chrome_2020-09-06_14-02-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4450522/92325575-33797500-f04c-11ea-86eb-b85469b6d91f.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20502","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/mdc-select): implement MDC-based mat-select\" (#20502)"},{"Id":"694346285","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T11:33:20","Actor":"aimhighrana","Number":"20501","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/fork/components-issue\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20501","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#20501)"},{"Id":"692414860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T07:19:28","Actor":"jornfranke","Number":"20495","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material): Angular 10 - Columns cannot be dragged and dropped in Material Table anymore","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

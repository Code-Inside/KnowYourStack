option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating **@angular** to v19, I’ve encountered a ton SCSS compiler deprecation warnings across many of my Angular projects. This issue occurs because the “_sass_” dependency in **@angular/build/package.json** was updated from “_1.77.6_” to “_1.80.6_”. As a temporary workaround, I reverted this dependency to “_1.77.6_” in the project’s node_modules directory, although this is - quite obvious - not ideal.\n\nIdeally, we should remove deprecated SCSS code in our scss files and 3rd party dependencies (this is where it becomes a nightmare). However, as a temporary solution to silence these deprecation warnings and be relieved when running “_ng s_“, it would be helpful to pass a “**stylePreprocessorOptions**” (already exists) flag via “_angular.json_“ into the Sass compiler.\n\nPlease note that in Nuxt/Vite and Ember, disabling these deprecation warnings is already possible, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67812380/disable-dart-sass-warnings-produced-by-external-theme-file) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78997907/the-legacy-js-api-is-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-dart-sass-2-0-0).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdditional option in “angular.json\". (Should default to false.)\n\n```\n\"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n  \"silenceDeprecations\": true\n},\n```\n\nThis should result in passing the flag \"--quiet-deps\" to the sass compiler. How to silence this warnings internally can be learned here: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#silencing-deprecations-in-dependencies\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDowngrade sass dep to “1.77.6“.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add style preprocessor option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19\" (#28829)"},{"Id":"2645837957","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T09:10:42","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28828","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency rollup to v4.25.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | minor | [`4.24.4` -> `4.25.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.24.4/4.25.0) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | devDependencies | minor | [`4.24.4` -> `4.25.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.24.4/4.25.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.25.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4250)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.24.4...v4.25.0)\n\n*2024-11-09*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Add `output.sourcemapDebugIds` option to add matching debug ids to sourcemaps and code for tools like Sentry or Rollbar ([#&#8203;5712](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5712))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Make it easier to manually reproduce base16 hashes by using a more standard base16 conversion algorithm ([#&#8203;5719](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5719))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5712](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5712): feat: Add support for injecting Debug IDs ([@&#8203;timfish](https://redirect.github.com/timfish))\n-   [#&#8203;5717](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5717): fix(deps): update swc monorepo (major) ([@&#8203;renovate](https://redirect.github.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5718](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5718): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://redirect.github.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5719](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5719): Use a less surprising base-16 encoding ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://redirect.github.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.27.1 - 08 Nov 2024\n\n-   The CodeQL Action now downloads bundles compressed using Zstandard on GitHub Enterprise Server when using Linux or macOS runners.

The content of the processed style is sent directly to the Angular compiler. However, any additional result files are collected and emitted in the application output. In most cases, this worked as expected as inline styles rarely had resource references that would overwrite each other. However, the potential is present for later inline styles for a component to overwrite these output files. To avoid this potential problem, the internal identifier now accounts for both the class name and order of the inline styles.

However, TailwindCSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework, is not included as an option. With TailwindCSS being increasingly adopted, adding it as a stylesheet option would streamline the setup process for developers who use it with Angular.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd TailwindCSS as an option in the ng new command alongside the existing options (CSS, SCSS, LESS, etc.). This would enable developers to choose TailwindCSS as the default stylesheet framework during project creation, allowing for automatic setup and configuration of Tailwind in the generated project.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**  \n\n1. **Installing TailwindCSS Manually After Initializing the Project**  \n   The current workaround for using TailwindCSS with Angular involves initializing a new project with `ng new` and then following these steps manually:\n   \n   - Install TailwindCSS and required PostCSS plugins:\n     ```bash\n     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\n     ```\n   - Generate the Tailwind configuration file:\n     ```bash\n     npx tailwindcss init\n     ```\n   - Update `tailwind.config.js` to define the content paths, like so:\n     ```javascript\n     module.exports = {\n       content: [\n         \"./src/**/*.{html,ts}\",\n       ],\n       theme: {\n         extend: {},\n       },\n       plugins: [],\n     }\n     ```\n   - Configure `styles.css` (or `styles.scss`) with Tailwind directives:\n     ```css\n     @tailwind base;\n     @tailwind components;\n     @tailwind utilities;\n     ```\n   - Optionally, create a `postcss.config.js` file if not already present to ensure compatibility with Angular's build.\n\n   While these steps are not overly complex, they add additional configuration overhead, especially for developers who are setting up multiple projects or who are new to Angular or TailwindCSS. This manual process can also introduce errors if configuration steps are missed or misconfigured.\n\n2. **Using a Third-Party TailwindCSS Integration**  \n   Some developers have created community guides and packages that streamline the Tailwind setup for Angular, but these are not officially supported and may lack the stability or compatibility assurance that comes with a native CLI integration. Additionally, relying on third-party solutions can introduce maintenance challenges if the third-party solution is no longer actively maintained.\n\n3. **Creating a Custom Schematic for TailwindCSS Setup**  \n   Angular allows developers to create custom schematics, which could automate the setup of TailwindCSS after project initialization. However, creating and maintaining a custom schematic requires extra knowledge and effort, and it adds another layer of customization that developers need to maintain across projects. This approach is often impractical for teams who need a simple, standard setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAdding TailwindCSS as an option in the Angular CLI would remove the need for these workarounds, allowing developers to select TailwindCSS during project initialization and have it configured automatically. This native support would reduce setup time, avoid common configuration errors, and enhance the developer experience by aligning Angular with modern CSS practices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28801","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add TailwindCSS as a Stylesheet Format Option in Angular CLI\" (#28801)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2646375163","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T17:53:00","Actor":"dedanade","Number":"29993","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/select): mat-select-arrow not rotating when dropdown is …","State":"open","Body":"fix(material/select): mat-select-arrow not rotating when dropdown is open.\r\n\r\nfixes mat-select not rotating when the dropdown menu is visible. fixes case [#29985](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29985)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29993","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/select): mat-select-arrow not rotating when dropdown is …\" (#29993)"},{"Id":"2646306238","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T16:51:10","Actor":"psmohan","Number":"29992","RawContent":null,"Title":"Corrected typo in documentation: change \"form\" to \"from\"","State":"open","Body":"This commit addresses a typographical error in the documentation by replacing \"form\" with \"from\" for accuracy and clarity.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29992","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Corrected typo in documentation: change \"form\" to \"from\"\" (#29992)"},{"Id":"2646273775","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T16:31:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29991","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/sidenav): prevent the content from jumping when hydrated","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the content of the sidenav was jumping when the page is hydrated, because we can't measure the sidenav on the server.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29991","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/sidenav): prevent the content from jumping when hydrated\" (#29991)"},{"Id":"2645179172","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-08T21:22:52","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29990","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): change ng-add to use mat.theme","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29990","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): change ng-add to use mat.theme\" (#29990)"},{"Id":"2645155248","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-08T21:04:54","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29989","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): update prebuilt themes to use mat.theme","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29989","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): update prebuilt themes to use mat.theme\" (#29989)"},{"Id":"2645144008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-08T20:56:53","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29988","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: consolidate theming guides","State":"open","Body":"Replaces existing guides for themes and styles and consolidates guidance into the single Theming guide.\r\n\r\nWill need to do some work on material.angular.io to make sure existing links still work for the deleted guides (redirect back to v18)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29988","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: consolidate theming guides\" (#29988)"},{"Id":"2643871103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-08T12:06:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29987","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/table): set explicit role on all cells","State":"open","Body":"We were omitting `role=\"cell\"` on native `td` elements, because the browser should be setting it implicitly, but based on the discussion in #29784, it seems like Safari doesn't do it.

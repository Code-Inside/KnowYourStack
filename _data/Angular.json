I'm not sure exactly what version broke it but, I had this working in angular 10 (or a very early version of angular 11).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIt appears ngcc is modifying files within node_modules/@datorama/akita/lib. The modificaitons add @angular/core as an import in store.d.ts (among a few other lines of code). Once this occurs I am no longer able to build the app if a web worker imports the @datorama/akita package as @angular/core requires the dom library which is not available in a web worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nI have a reproduction here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-wvs54l\r\nHowever, stackblitz doesn't seem to support webworkers. So, you need to download the project and then perform:\r\n```\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run ng build\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially all you need to do is create an angular app\r\n* Add the @datorama/akita npm package\r\n* Add a webworker\r\n* Instantiate the webworker in the angular app\r\n* In the webworker import the @datorama/akita package\r\n\r\nOnce you have done this any attempt to build the app will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nError: ./src/app/web-workers/test.worker.ts (./node_modules/worker-plugin/dist/loader.js?name=0!./src/app/web-workers/test.worker.ts)\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/worker-plugin/dist/loader.js):\r\nError: node_modules/@angular/core/core.d.ts:10411:62 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'Element'.\r\n\r\n10411 export declare function ɵgetDebugNode__POST_R3__(nativeNode: Element): DebugElement__POST_R3__;\r\n</code></pre>\r\nThere are more errors that follow which all are basically due to the dom library not being available in a web worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.2.13\r\nNode: 14.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.13\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1102.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1102.13\r\n@angular-devkit/core            7.3.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      7.3.10\r\n@angular/compiler-cli           11.2.14\r\n@schematics/angular             11.2.13\r\n@schematics/update              0.1102.13\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.0.7\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- Is this a browser specific issue?

As previously discussed in pull/31070 and issues/30486, this would be useful because it is often desirable to apply styles to fields that are both `ng-invalid` and `ng-pristine` after the first attempt at form submission, but Angular does not currently provide any simple way to do this (although evidently Angularjs did).\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nA new `ng-submitted` class is set on submitted forms. It will now be possible to select untouched but invalid fields in a submitted form (for example, with a selector such as`.ng-submitted .ng-invalid`).\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the directive that sets control status classes on forms and formGroups has its set of statuses widened to include `ng-submitted`. Then, in the event that `is('submitted')` is invoked, the `submitted` property of the control container is returned iff it exists. This is preferred over checking whether the container is a `Form` or `FormGroup` directly to avoid reflecting on those classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses #30486.\r\nCloses #31070.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/42132","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add `ng-submitted` class to forms that have been submitted.\" (#42132)"},{"Id":"893358393","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-17T14:32:00","Actor":"rudyhadoux","Number":"42130","RawContent":null,"Title":"display delay","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\n**I absolutely don't understand why console.log is immediate and the TEXT value is refreshed after 23 seconds....** \r\n\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\n@Component( {\r\n  selector: 'isochrone',\r\n  templateUrl: './isochrone.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: [ './isochrone.component.scss' ]\r\n} )\r\nexport class IsochroneComponent implements OnInit\r\n{\r\n  origin1 = new google.maps.LatLng(55.930385, -3.118425);\r\n  destination1 = new google.maps.LatLng(50.087692, 14.421150);\r\n  text: BehaviorSubject<string>;\r\n\r\n  constructor ()\r\n  {\r\n    this.text = new BehaviorSubject<string>( 'start' );\r\n   }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit (): void\r\n  {\r\n this.fetchitems();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  fetchitems ()\r\n  {\r\n   new google.maps.DistanceMatrixService().getDistanceMatrix({\r\n      origins: [this.origin1],\r\n      destinations: [this.destination1],\r\n      travelMode: google.maps.TravelMode.DRIVING,\r\n      unitSystem: google.maps.UnitSystem.METRIC\r\n    }, ( response, status ) =>\r\n   {\r\n     console.log( 'response = ' + JSON.stringify( response ));\r\n     this.text.next(JSON.stringify( response ));\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/42130","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"display delay\" (#42130)"},{"Id":"893327272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-17T13:28:30","Actor":"Romko775","Number":"42129","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n dynamic data localization message extraction","State":"closed","Body":"# Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n@angular/localize\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFor now you can localize text only if it is in the html file (i18n attribute) or signing to value like `title = $localize\r\n:@@myTitle:Title';`, but this is not covering the translation of data that can be received via http (keys, strings other).

`:enter` transition aliases of an element, gets their callbacks triggered even for events that should not.\r\nSetting up these animations\r\n```ts\r\n\ttrigger('fromLeft', [\r\n\t\ttransition(':enter', [\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        ...\r\n        trigger('fromRight', [\r\n               transition(':leave', [\r\n```\r\nto this element\r\n```html\r\n<div [@fromLeft] [@fromRight]\r\n (@fromLeft.start)=\"mylog('DYNAMIC ENTER START', $event)\" \r\n (@fromRight.start)=\"mylog('DYNAMIC LEAVE START', $event)\" \r\n (@fromLeft.done)=\"mylog('DYNAMIC ENTER DONE', $event)\" \r\n (@fromRight.done)=\"mylog('DYNAMIC LEAVE DONE', $event)\" >\r\n ```\r\nWill print every log on all events. \r\nOn element creation `leave` logs will be printed too, and on element destruction same thing will happen with `enter` logs.\r\nThis happens both with content projected by `<ng-content>` both with static elements.\r\nProof is into the logged event, like:\r\n```\r\nDYNAMIC LEAVE START\r\ndisabled: false\r\nelement: HTMLDivElement\r\nfromState: \"void\"\r\nphaseName: \"start\"\r\ntoState: null\r\ntotalTime: 0\r\ntriggerName: \"fromRight\"\r\n```\r\nAs you can see an event from `void` to `null` triggered the callback for an animation bound to `:leave` alias\r\n\r\n## Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere you can find a SB showing

But since those comments were marked as off-topic, I'm creating a separate issue for this. The solution mentioned by @clydin (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20731#issuecomment-840599021) (installing shim packages, e.g. `crypto-browserify`, and specifying it in `paths` section of `tsconfig.json`) works within the project code but not for the npm libraries. \r\n\r\nJust to recap, the question is: how can I provide Node.js shims to resolve `crypto`, `stream` and other modules in Angular 12 if those modules are referred in npm packages (outside of project code)? There's no clear way to follow instruction mentioned in error logs (I mean adding `resolve.fallback`) since the webpack config isn't exposed in Angular, and I would prefer to avoid using custom angular builders e.g. https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>./node_modules/swarm-js/node_modules/eth-lib/lib/bytes.js:9:193-227 - Error: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in '/Users/mitusha/vault12/vault12/node_modules/swarm-js/node_modules/eth-lib/lib'\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.\r\nThis is no longer the case.

The change appears to cut the down the production build time on material.angular.io before the @use migration by more than 60%.\r\n\r\nFixes #22676.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22687","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): reduce the number of module resolutions required for the legacy theming bundle\" (#22687)"},{"Id":"890549489","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T23:02:34","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"22685","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/stepper): add example with MatStepperIntl service","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22685","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material/stepper): add example with MatStepperIntl service\" (#22685)"},{"Id":"890474565","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T20:45:04","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"22684","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-experimental/mdc-slider): make small fixes needed to imp…","State":"open","Body":"…lement the gmat mdc slider internally\r\n\r\n* change imports of @material/base to @material/base/types\r\n* explicitly check attributes when calling setAttribute to prevent xss","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-slider): make small fixes needed to imp…\" (#22684)"},{"Id":"890452930","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T20:21:13","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"22683","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: copy 12.0.0 changelog to master","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22683","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: copy 12.0.0 changelog to master\" (#22683)"},{"Id":"890444400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T20:20:41","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"22682","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 12.0.0 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22682","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 12.0.0 w/ changelog\" (#22682)"},{"Id":"890420965","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T19:41:29","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"22681","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump angular deps to 12.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22681","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump angular deps to 12.0.0\" (#22681)"},{"Id":"890418660","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T19:31:55","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"22680","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: update angular version in packages.bzl","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22680","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: update angular version in packages.bzl\" (#22680)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2021-05-18T05:30:05.0085238Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2949}

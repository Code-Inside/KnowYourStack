To do this, the following changes had to be made:\r\n* The metadata passed into `ɵɵngDeclareComponent` has an additional field called `deferBlockDependencies` which has an array of the dependency loading functions for each defer block in the template. During linking, the dependency functions are loaded by matching their template index to the index in the `deferBlockDependencies` array.\r\n* There's a new `ɵɵngDeclareClassMetadataAsync` function that is created for components that have deferred dependencies. It gets transpiled to `setClassMetadataAsync` and works in the same way by capturing a dependency loading function and setting the metadata after the dependencies are resolved. It also has some extra fields for capturing the version which are standard in linker-generated code.\r\n* Deferred import statements are now stripped in partial compilation mode, similar to full compilation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54908","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support deferred blocks in partial compilation\" (#54908)"},{"Id":"2189609797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-15T23:31:45","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"54907","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): make `any` injector scope configurable","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates an internal logic to treat `any` as any other scope.

The fact that signal value unwrapping is function-based breaks Typescript's nullability checking in a fairly major way, especially in templates.  This leads to either duplicate nullability checks, use of !'s to quell the compiler, or people switching off null checks altogether.\r\n\r\nIt's a very poor developer experience.\r\n\r\nThat issue has been open for more than a year with no response I can find from the Angular team.  Some engagement would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, PLEASE!\r\n\r\n### Plagiarised original issue:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of signals uses a function to access the value, and TypeScript has issues with type guards in that case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst count = signal(null as null | number);\r\nconst total: number = count() !== null ? count() : 0;\r\n// Error: Type `number | null` is not assignable to type `number`\r\n```\r\nThis can be workaround by storing the value in a temporary variable or with an explicit cast, but this could be a bit cumbersome, as I imagine the same would happen with ngIf in templates:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst count = signal(null as null | number);\r\nconst value = count();\r\nconst total: number = value !== null ? value : 0;\r\n// Works\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My own additional colour\r\n```typescript\r\nsomeSignal = signal<number | undefined>(undefined);\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.someSignal.set(1)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal() !== undefined) {\r\n  {{someSignal() + 1}}\r\n}\r\n<!-- Object is possibly 'undefined' -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal(); as someSignal) {\r\n  @if (someSignal !== undefined) {\r\n    {{someSignal + 1}}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<!-- Works, but this is a horrible developer experience -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal()) {\r\n  {{someSignal()! + 1}}\r\n}\r\n<!-- Techincally works, but makes nullability checking useless -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThis entire issue would be moot were Signals to use getters rather than functions to unwrap the inner value.

The app has one dynamic component, the Quiz component, which takes in a Doc ID via the URL, and then fetches the quiz data from the Firebase server. I make sure that the Quiz page(s) are rendered via SSR by including them in a routes.txt file.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is that the rendered Quiz pages have no data from the server. This is really important to me, because the player should be able to share their score to social media after playing, and making that happen involved updating the Open Graph tags with the correct data. Since FB scrapes the pages before any JavaScript fires, the only way to make sure the correct tags are in place is to pre-generate the pages. In other words, even if the page loads the Quiz dynamically for the player, it is not working for the scraper, and that breaks everything. \r\n\r\nI have asked for help on StackOverflow and the /r/Angular forum on Reddit, and have received no replies at all. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78157528/angular-17-ssr-doesnt-generate-the-static-pages-with-any-data-when-using-fireba)\r\n\r\nSince this particular project has several \"moving parts\" (Database setup, SSR generation) it is difficult to impossible to create a minimal reproduction of the bug. \r\n\r\nI've researched this problem on the web. Generally speaking, the only info available about this topic seems to be related to older versions of both Firebase, and related to \"Angular Universal\" which has since been replaced by SSR. In other words, those solutions no longer apply. What I have learned however is that Angular does not seem to wait for Firebase to fully resolve before rendering the page. The thing is, I have no idea how to fix that. I don't how to prove it either, however it does seem like a reasonable assumption. \r\n\r\nHere is the code that loads the data from Firebase in the constructor of the Quiz component. This works fine locally. It just doesn't generate the SRR correctly. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  import { Component, inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n  import { Firestore, getDoc, doc, DocumentSnapshot } from '@angular/fire/firestore';\r\n  import { QuizData } from '../../interfaces/quiz-data';\r\n  import { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';\r\n  import { Meta } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\n  import { RouterModule } from \"@angular/router\";\r\n  \r\n  export class QuizComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n\t  private firestore: Firestore = inject(Firestore);\r\n\t  documentID: string = '';\r\n\t  \r\n\t  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private metaTagService: Meta, private router: Router) {}\r\n\t  \r\n\t  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.documentID = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id')!;\r\n\r\n    getDoc(doc(this.firestore, 'quizzes', this.documentID)).then((doc) => {\r\n      // Set the quiz data\r\n      this.quiz = doc.data() as QuizData;\r\n\r\n      // Assign the first question to the current question\r\n      this.currentQuestion = this.quiz.questions[0];\r\n\r\n      // Update the meta tags\r\n      this.metaTagService.updateTag({ property: 'og:title', content: this.quiz.topic + ' Quiz' });\r\n      this.metaTagService.updateTag({ property: 'og:description', content: 'Think you know your ' + this.quiz.topic + ' trivia?' });\r\n      this.metaTagService.updateTag({ property: 'og:url', content: \"https://www.example.com/quiz/\" + this.documentID });\r\n      this.metaTagService.updateTag({ property: 'og:image', content: this.bgImage });\r\n    });\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere is no error per se, the error is that the page is generated without the Quiz data or the updated tags.

It is valid to update state in render hooks and we need to ensure we refresh views that may be marked for check in these hooks (this can happen simply as a result of focusing an element). This change ensures that the behavior of `markForCheck` with respect to this loop does not change while we are actively running change detection on a view tree.\r\n\r\nThis approach also has the benefit of preventing a regression for #18917, where updating state in animation listeners can cause `ExpressionChanged...Error` This should be allowed - there is nothing wrong with respect to unidirectional data flow in this case.\r\n\r\nThere may be other cases in the future where it is valid to update state.

The use case is something like Facebook, where you can infinitely route forward through pages of different friends. I've been able to do this in versions prior to 16 as well.\r\n\r\nThe routes for the pages look something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// some-other.component.ts\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: SomeOtherComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    // SomeOtherComponent loads the first instance of RecursiveComponent.  \r\n    path: 'recursive',\r\n    loadChildren: () => import('./recursive.component')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\n// recursive.component.ts\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: RecursiveComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    // RecursiveComponent is able to load another version of itself. \r\n    path: 'recursive',\r\n    loadChildren: () => import('./recursive.component')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an [example of this working in Angular 16](https://github.com/WhatsThatItsPat/recursive-ng16). The example is meant to mimic a tabbed Ionic app.\r\n\r\nFrom any tab, you can tap the `recursive N` button. The URL will continue to grow as `recursive` is added as a URL segment.\r\n\r\nBut it [doesn't work in Angular 17](https://github.com/WhatsThatItsPat/recursive-ng17).

for their host bindings to refresh. Previously, the host\n    bindings were refreshed for all root views without respecting the\n    `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n-   The `ComponentFixture` `autoDetect` feature will no\n    longer refresh the component's host view when the component is `OnPush`\n    and not marked dirty. This exposes existing issues in components which\n    claim to be `OnPush` but do not correctly call `markForCheck` when they\n    need to be refreshed. If this change causes test failures, the easiest\n    fix is to change the component to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`.\n-   When Angular runs change detection, it will continue to\n    refresh any views attached to `ApplicationRef` that are still marked for\n    check after one round completes. In rare cases, this can result in infinite\n    loops when certain patterns continue to mark views for check using\n    `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges`. This will be surfaced as a runtime\n    error with the `NG0103` code.\n-   The `ComponentFixture.autoDetect` feature now executes\n    change detection for the fixture within `ApplicationRef.tick`. This more\n    closely matches the behavior of how a component would refresh in\n    production. The order of component refresh in tests may be slightly\n    affected as a result, especially when dealing with additional components\n    attached to the application, such as dialogs. Tests sensitive to this\n    type of change (such as screenshot tests) may need to be updated.\n    Concretely, this change means that the component will refresh *before*\n    additional views attached to `ApplicationRef` (i.e. dialog components).\n    Prior to this change, the fixture component would refresh *after* other\n    views attached to the application.\n-   The exact timing of change detection execution when\n    using event or run coalescing with `NgZone` is now the first of either\n    `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame`. Code which relies on this\n    timing (usually by accident) will need to be adjusted. If a callback\n    needs to execute after change detection, we recommend `afterNextRender`\n    instead of something like `setTimeout`.\n-   Newly created and views marked for check and reattached\n    during change detection are now guaranteed to be refreshed in that same\n    change detection cycle. Previously, if they were attached at a location\n    in the view tree that was already checked, they would either throw\n    `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` or not be refreshed until\n    some future round of change detection. In rare circumstances, this\n    correction can cause issues. We identified one instance that relied on\n    the previous behavior by reading a value on initialization which was\n    queued to be updated in a microtask instead of being available in the\n    current change detection round. The component only read this value during\n    initialization and did not read it again after the microtask updated it.\n\n##### router\n\n-   Guards can now return `RedirectCommand` for redirects\n    in addition to `UrlTree`. Code which expects only `boolean` or `UrlTree`\n    values in `Route` types will need to be adjusted.\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

This was silently compiled incorrectly in esbuild 0.19.7 and below, and was an error from esbuild 0.19.8 to esbuild 0.20.1. Code such as the following should now work correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    const log = (x: any, y: string) => console.log(y)\n    abstract class Foo { @&#8203;log abstract foo: string }\n    new class extends Foo { foo = '' }\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    __decorateClass([\n      log\n    ], Foo.prototype, \"foo\", 2);\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n    ```\n\n-   JSON loader now preserves `__proto__` properties ([#&#8203;3700](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3700))\n\n    Copying JSON source code into a JavaScript file will change its meaning if a JSON object contains the `__proto__` key. A literal `__proto__` property in a JavaScript object literal sets the prototype of the object instead of adding a property named `__proto__`, while a literal `__proto__` property in a JSON object literal just adds a property named `__proto__`. With this release, esbuild will now work around this problem by converting JSON to JavaScript with a computed property key in this case:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from 'data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}'\n    if (Object.getPrototypeOf(data)?.fail) throw 'fail'\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { __proto__: { fail: true } };\n\n      // entry.js\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { [\"__proto__\"]: { fail: true } };\n\n      // example.mjs\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Improve dead code removal of `switch` statements ([#&#8203;3659](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3659))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now remove `switch` statements in branches when minifying if they are known to never be evaluated:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if (true) foo(); else switch (bar) { case 1: baz(); break }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    if(1)foo();else switch(bar){case 1:}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    foo();\n    ```\n\n-   Empty enums should behave like an object literal ([#&#8203;3657](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3657))\n\n    TypeScript allows you to create an empty enum and add properties to it at run time. While people usually use an empty object literal for this instead of a TypeScript enum, esbuild's enum transform didn't anticipate this use case and generated `undefined` instead of `{}` for an empty enum. With this release, you can now use an empty enum to generate an empty object literal.\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    enum Foo {}\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n    })(Foo || {});\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n      return Foo2;\n    })(Foo || {});\n    ```\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play edge case with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3698](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3698))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map failed to work when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3682](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3682))\n\n    Version 0.20.0 of esbuild changed how the esbuild child process is run in esbuild's API for Deno. Previously it used `Deno.run` but that API is being removed in favor of `Deno.Command`. As part of this change, esbuild is now calling the new `unref` function on esbuild's long-lived child process, which is supposed to allow Deno to exit when your code has finished running even though the child process is still around (previously you had to explicitly call esbuild's `stop()` function to terminate the child process for Deno to be able to exit).\n\n    However, this introduced a problem for Deno's testing API which now fails some tests that use esbuild with `error: Promise resolution is still pending but the event loop has already resolved`. It's unclear to me why this is happening. The call to `unref` was recommended by someone on the Deno core team, and calling Node's equivalent `unref` API has been working fine for esbuild in Node for a long time. It could be that I'm using it incorrectly, or that there's some reference counting and/or garbage collection bug in Deno's internals, or that Deno's `unref` just works differently than Node's `unref`. In any case, it's not good for Deno tests that use esbuild to be failing.\n\n    In this release, I am removing the call to `unref` to fix this issue. This means that you will now have to call esbuild's `stop()` function to allow Deno to exit, just like you did before esbuild version 0.20.0 when this regression was introduced.\n\n    Note: This regression wasn't caught earlier because Deno doesn't seem to fail tests that have outstanding `setTimeout` calls, which esbuild's test harness was using to enforce a maximum test runtime. Adding a `setTimeout` was allowing esbuild's Deno tests to succeed. So this regression doesn't necessarily apply to all people using tests in Deno.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.29.2`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5292)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.29.1...v5.29.2)\n\n-   Make sure 'computed_props' creates string keys\n-   Take into account the evaluated size when inlining\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.9.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   feat: add new dispatch compose by [@&#8203;metcoder95](https://togithub.com/metcoder95) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826)\n-   ci: add macos-latest to test-matrix by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952)\n-   types: align RequestInit.body type with lib.dom.ts by [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   ci: pin versions of github actions by [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n-   fetch: improve output for FormData, Response, Request by [@&#8203;mertcanaltin](https://togithub.com/mertcanaltin) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955)\n-   perf: optimize collectASequenceOfBytes by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Make `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` call the web test runner.\r\n\r\nUsing the web test runner config would also enable to launch multiple browsers with their playwright package:\r\n```ts\r\n// web-test-runner.config.mjs\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n// ...\r\nplugins: [angular()],\r\nbrowsers: [\r\n      playwrightLauncher({ product: 'chromium' }),\r\n      playwrightLauncher({ product: 'firefox' }),\r\n      playwrightLauncher({ product: 'webkit' }),\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAngular would not introduce a new api, a developer could just use the web test runner api.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// angular.json\r\n\r\n\"test\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"wtrPath\": \"some/non/default/path\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nExpose the web test runner api in the options of the `test` target in the `angular.json`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27278","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature: @angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner picks up the web test runner config\" (#27278)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2190777925","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-17T19:16:56","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28735","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(material/autocomplete): fix safari failure on CI","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28735","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(material/autocomplete): fix safari failure on CI\" (#28735)"},{"Id":"2190570721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-17T09:36:04","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28734","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to Angular v18 next","State":"open","Body":"Bumps the repo to the `next` version of Angular 18.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28734","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update to Angular v18 next\" (#28734)"},{"Id":"2190286562","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-16T22:28:48","Actor":"SarenT","Number":"28733","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently button toggle and slide toggle are not supported inside mat form fields.

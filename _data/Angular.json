It was a wizard-like component that was showing steps. My desire was that each step would only be created once the user moved to it. This was implemented using directives, `TemplateRef` and `*ngTemplateOutlet`.\n\nWhile I got the code working, I noticed that after leaving a step, the step's DOM was not destroyed, it was detached and still using memory.\n\nI created a simple reproduction only using control flow and the issue is still observed. Despite no references to the form group or the `formControlName` in the active code, the Form elements are leaked. It appears that Angular is hanging onto the parent component's lifecycle and only when that component is destroyed is the leaked DOM cleaned up.\n\n<img width=\"937\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ebac89-297f-43ad-bb4e-df23500ed04c\" />\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/arobinson/angular-detached-dom-form-control-name-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nDetached <form>\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true \n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.4\nNode: 24.3.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.13.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.0.5\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.4\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.4\n@angular/build               20.0.4\n@angular/cli                 20.0.4\n@schematics/angular          20.0.4\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is causing my wizard component to leak the DOM of every step that uses Angular forms.

Loop continues indefinitely until the invalid call is removed\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n**New improved behavior:**\r\n- All sanitization bypass functions now validate their input parameters\r\n- Invalid URLs throw descriptive error messages instead of causing silent crashes\r\n- Added comprehensive validation for:\r\n  - `bypassSanitizationTrustUrl()`: Validates URL format and blocks dangerous protocols\r\n  - `bypassSanitizationTrustResourceUrl()`: Stricter validation with allowed protocols whitelist\r\n  - `bypassSanitizationTrustScript()`: Basic XSS pattern detection\r\n  - `bypassSanitizationTrustStyle()`: CSS injection pattern detection\r\n  - `bypassSanitizationTrustHtml()`: Input validation\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:**\r\n- **Clear error messages**: Developers immediately know what's wrong and where\r\n- **No more silent crashes**: Errors are thrown synchronously with stack traces\r\n- **Security enhancements**: Additional validation prevents common security issues\r\n- **Developer experience**: Saves debugging time with descriptive error messages\r\n\r\n**Example error messages:**\r\n```\r\nError: Invalid resource URL format: not-a-valid-url\r\nError: Protocol not allowed for resource URLs: javascript:\r\nError: Script content contains potentially dangerous patterns\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n**No breaking changes:** This fix only adds validation that throws errors for inputs that would have crashed the application anyway.

It went OK but then I tried to run unit tests and some of them failed because they're trying to load a 3rd party script. So basically this simplified piece of code was throwing an error\n\n```ts\nloadScript() {\n    return new Observable<void>(obs => {\n      const script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      script.src = \"test.js\";\n\n      script.onload = () => {\n        obs.next();\n        obs.complete();\n      }\n\n      script.onerror = () => {\n        obs.error();\n        obs.complete();\n      }\n      document.body.appendChild(script);\n    })\n}\n```\n\nWe have a config for the script file in `angular.json`. Here it is (I just renamed it for the sake of simplicity)\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": [\n              {\n                \"input\": \"src/test.js\",\n                \"bundleName\": \"test\",\n                \"inject\": false\n              }\n  ]\n```\n\nThis works fine in v19 but doesn't in v20.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI created two repos with a unit test which tries to load a script\n- v19 https://github.com/ms-dosx86/test-v19 (passes)\n- v20 https://github.com/ms-dosx86/test-v20 (doesn't pass)\n\nJust run `ng test`.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.4\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.0.5\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.4\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.4\n@angular/build               20.0.4\n@angular/cli                 20.0.4\n@schematics/angular          20.0.4\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30627","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Scripts are not loaded properly in v20\" (#30627)"},{"Id":"3186274084","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-30T08:50:09","Actor":"k-schneider","Number":"30623","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 20 + Express v5 async handlers result in a deprecation warning logged","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsing async handlers with Express v5 and a freshly scaffolded Angular project results in a deprecation warning being logged:\n\n`router deprecated handlers that are Promise-like are deprecated, use a native Promise instead`\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`ng new`\n\nchoose \"Yes\" to enable SSR\n\nIn the scaffolded `server.ts` rewrite this:\n\n```ts\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  angularApp\n    .handle(req)\n    .then((response) =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next(),\n    )\n    .catch(next);\n});\n```\n\nto:\n\n```ts\napp.use(async (req, res, next) => {\n  try {\n    const response = await angularApp.handle(req);\n    if (response) {\n      writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res);\n    } else {\n      next();\n    }\n  } catch {\n    next();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNow run `ng serve` and open a browser to http://localhost:4200.

I used to start-up my frontend via the following CLI command:\n`ng serve --ssl true --ssl-cert ssl/server.crt --ssl-key ssl/server.key`\nIn previous version: 19.2.7 of the CLI, it starts up without errors. After I upgraded to Angular CLI 20.0.4, when I run the above command, I get the following error at the end of the CLI's log:\n\n> Watchpack Error (initial scan): Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'D:\\System Volume Information'\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f573b4a2-4f59-4315-87b4-7255c04c21b1)\n\nMy

tsconfig.json:\n\n[tsconfig.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20949607/tsconfig.json)\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**Minimal Reproduction Path**\n- Open a Windows 10 (22H2) Elevated Command Prompt inside the project root folder.\n- Run the command: `ng serve --ssl true --ssl-cert ssl/server.crt --ssl-key ssl/server.key`\n\n**Expected Result**:\nThe Application start up without any error(s)\n\n**Actual Result**\nThe CLI's log contains at the end the following error:\nWatchpack Error (initial scan): Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'D:\\System Volume Information'\n\n\n**Notes**\nMy Operating System is: Windows 10 (22H2)\nThe serve command is run from within an Elevated Command Prompt (with Admin rights).\nI am not a \"Full Admin\" on my Dev station.\nI cannot even access the above-mentioned folder even from Windows Explorer (Access Denied).\nIn Previous Angular (CLI version 19.2.7) the error Does not appear.\n\n### Exception or

previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2.20 (18.2.x latest)\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using `@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.4`, running `yarn` shows this warning:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn\nyarn install v1.22.22\n...\nwarning \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.4 > @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl@2.0.0\"\n        has unmet peer dependency \"vite@^6.0.0\".\n```\nThis happens because `@angular-devkit/build-angular` includes `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`, which has a peer dependency on `vite`.\nHowever, `build-angular` itself does not actually use this plugin, so the dependency is unnecessary.\n\nThis issue was fixed once in v18.2.x (issue: #29921 , PR: #29928 ),\nbut the problem exists in v19 and v20, as well as in older v18.x versions before the fix.\n\n To fix this, the dependency on `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` should be removed from `@angular-devkit/build-angular`, just like in v18.2.x.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIn package.json:\n\n```json\n{\n...\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"20.0.1\",\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"20.0.0\"\n  }\n...\n}\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nYou will get:\n\n```bash\nwarning \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.0 > @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl@2.0.0\" has unmet peer dependency \"vite@^6.0.0\".\n```\n\n\n###

This can lead to the data-bound elements within the table rows displaying outdated information, even if their underlying data properties have been modified.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by adding `_changeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` calls within the `renderRows` method of `CdkTable`. These calls ensure that whenever the table's data or row definitions are updated, the component is explicitly marked for change detection. This forces a re-evaluation of the bindings for all visible rows, ensuring the view remains consistent with the latest underlying data.\r\n\r\nA new test case has been added to `table.spec.ts` to specifically verify this behavior in an `OnPush` component using `trackBy` when data properties are updated.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31451","RelatedDescription":"Open PR

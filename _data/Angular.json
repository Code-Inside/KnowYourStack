As discussed in [#&#8203;3659](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/3659), the performance regressions from [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector) turned out to be higher than anticipated. In the future, we can revisit `@asamuzakjp/dom-selector` after it reaches `nwsapi`'s performance on the [two real-world benchmarks provided by the community](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/3659#issuecomment-1890852609).\n\nSince reverting to `nwsapi` causes several functionality regressions, e.g. removing `:has()` support, we've decided to make this a major version.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n-   Small fixes to edge-case behavior of the following properties: `input.maxLength`, `input.minLength`, `input.size`, `progress.max`, `tableCell.colSpan`, `tableCell.rowSpan`, `tableCol.span`, `textArea.cols`, `textArea.maxLength`, `textArea.minLength`, `textArea.rows`.\n\n### [`v23.2.0`](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2320)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/23.1.0...23.2.0)\n\nThis release switches our CSS selector engine from [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/nwsapi) to [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector). The new engine is more actively maintained, and supports many new selectors: see [the package's documentation](https://togithub.com/asamuzaK/domSelector#supported-css-selectors) for the full list. It also works better with shadow trees.\n\nThere is a potential of a performance regression due to this change. In our stress test benchmark, which runs most of [these 273 selectors](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/908f27d4e348502a9068f0b335a8518d050ef872/benchmark/selectors/sizzle-speed/selectors.large.css) against [this 128 KiB document](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/908f27d4e348502a9068f0b335a8518d050ef872/benchmark/selectors/sizzle-speed/selector.html), the new engine completes the benchmark only 0.25x as fast. However, we're hopeful that in more moderate usage this will not be a significant issue. Any help speeding up `@asamuzakjp/dom-selector` is appreciated, and feel free to open an issue if this has had a significant impact on your project.\n\n### [`v23.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2310)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/23.0.1...23.1.0)\n\n-   Added an initial implementation of `ElementInternals`, including the `shadowRoot` getter and the string-valued ARIA properties.

size while packing in more features!\n\n*Note: install using `husky@latest` to get the bug fixes that were released after.*\n\n#### 👋 By the Way\n\n**I'm available for remote work** (Front-end/Back-end mainly JS/TS but open to other stacks Rails, Go, Elixir). You can contact me at my mail: typicode at gmail :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n#### Introducing `husky init`\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpm pkg set scripts.prepare=\"husky install\"\nnpm run prepare\nnpx husky add .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\n```\n\n##### v9\n\nAdding husky to a project is now easier than ever. It's just a single line that does the same as above. No need to read the docs to get started anymore.\n\n```shell\nnpx husky init\n```\n\n#### Adding a New Hook\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpx husky add  .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\ngit add --chmod=+x .husky/pre-commit # On Windows\n```\n\n##### v9\n\nAdding a hook is as simple as creating a file. This can be accomplished using your favorite editor, a script or a basic `echo` command. For example, on Linux/macOS:\n\n```shell\necho \"npm test\" > .husky/pre-commit\n```\n\n#### Further Size Reduction\n\n`v8` was already the most compact Git hooks manager at approximately `6kB`.\n\n`v9` takes this a step further, reducing the size to just `3kB`, likely making it the smallest devDependency in your toolkit.\n\n**To give you an idea of how small it is, the biggest file in the project is the MIT license 😄**\n\n#### More to Come\n\nAdditional features are in the pipeline for `v9`. Stay tuned :raised_hands:\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   **Enhanced security** with CI and npm `--provenance` for safer publishing.\n-   Added **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** support. Move `~/.huskyrc` to `~/.config/husky/init.sh` for centralized configuration.\n-   **Fixed permission issue for Windows-created hooks**; they no longer need to be executable.\n-   Removed `husky install`. Use `husky` or `husky some/dir` for the same functionality (deprecation notice to be added).\n-   Modified behavior when `.git` is missing; it now triggers a warning instead of failure.\n-   Replaced `HUSKY_DEBUG=1` with `HUSKY=2` for debugging.\n-   Updated the Husky API for module usage.\n-   Transitioned to `ESM` for module usage.\n-   Dropped support for Node 14 and 16.\n-   Revamped docs.\n\n#### How to Migrate\n\n`v9` is backward compatible with `v8`, allowing you to freely upgrade and migrate your hooks later.\n\nHere are the steps to migrate:\n\n`package.json`\n\n```diff\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n-   \"prepare\": \"husky install\"\n+   \"prepare\": \"husky\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`.husky/pre-commit`\n\n```diff\n- #!/usr/bin/env sh\n- . \"$(dirname -- \"$0\")/_/husky.sh\"\nnpm test \n```\n\n*Note: `sh` will be used to run hooks, even if a shebang is set.*\n\nIf you were using `husky` as a module:\n\n```diff\n- const husky = require('husky')\n- // ...\n+ import husky from 'husky'\n+ console.log(husky())\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I have never done it before, so I lack expertise to tell whether this is just the control flow being too fresh atm, or I'm missing some bits to make it work.\r\n\r\n### Stackblitz:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-xepthd?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n(the code can be messy, I was just exploring different approaches)\r\n\r\n### Shortly:\r\nI dynamically load a component, based on user `mode` selection, each of the components that I expect to load, has to implement a specific abstract class, so that I can safely call their method no matter which one is loaded.\r\n\r\nHere, let me paste the main html file which should demonstrate what I am after\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n  <select (change)=\"selectTemplate(templateSelect.value)\" #templateSelect>\r\n    <option value=\"one\">One</option>\r\n    <option value=\"two\">Two</option>\r\n  </select>\r\n\r\n  <section #vcr #components>\r\n    @switch(mode){\r\n      @case('one'){\r\n        <app-form-one #component />\r\n      }\r\n      @case('two'){\r\n        <app-form-two #component />\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  </section>\r\n\r\n  <button (click)=\"submit()\">Submit</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to suggest proposed solutions (maybe it's already solved?) but as a developer I find this scenario way too complex, and I think the new control flow syntax might also feature some ways to accomplish that.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to easily get a reference of the currently loaded component within the `@switch` block:\r\n- either via `ViewContainerRef` and `read` query (by the class implemented),\r\n- or via `@ViewChild` + `read` query,\r\n- or `@ViewChildren` + read query\r\n- or a method to call on VCR to get the component/implemented class on demand (here: in the submit method)\r\n\r\nI think in this case the most intuitive way would be via `@ViewChildren` and accessing `first`, but maybe the `@switch` syntax could also be extended to always map the current case to a variable.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other ways to achieve same goal, but I think various components implementing an abstract class is pretty clean and legit to pursue in this scenario.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNone comes to mind.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54285","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Querying ViewChild(ren) within currently active `@switch` case\" (#54285)"},{"Id":"2121418958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T18:38:50","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54286","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: address prototype polution concern with better typing","State":"closed","Body":"Update typing to show that a number is being used as index rather than any random string\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/angular/security/code-scanning/115\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/angular/security/code-scanning/114","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54286","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: address prototype polution concern with better typing\" (#54286)"},{"Id":"2121152607","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T18:09:48","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"54276","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54276","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#54276)"},{"Id":"2121329454","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T17:54:46","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54282","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to latest @angular/docs","State":"closed","Body":"Update to the latest version of angular docs from dev-infra\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54282","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to latest @angular/docs\" (#54282)"},{"Id":"2121313670","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T17:45:15","Actor":"ilirbeqirii","Number":"54281","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: replace event word with property for binding properties link","State":"closed","Body":"Replace the \"event\" word with the correct one \"property\" at the helpful text on event binding section\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This option allows global identifiers present in the code to be replaced with another value at build time.

The option has similar capabilities to the `esbuild` option of the same name. The documentation for that option can be found here: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define \r\nThe command line capabilities of the Angular CLI option are not yet implemented and will added in a future change.\r\n\r\nThe option within the `angular.json` configuration file is of the form of an object. The keys of the object represent the global identifier to replace and the values of the object represent the corresponding replacement value for the identifier. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"define\": {\r\n    \"SOME_CONSTANT\": \"5\",\r\n    \"ANOTHER\": \"'this is a string literal'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll replacement values are defined as strings within the configuration file. If the replacement is intended to be an actual string literal, it should be enclosed in single quote marks. This allows the flexibility of using any valid JSON type as well as a different identifier as a replacement.\r\n\r\nAn important caveat to the option is that it does not function when used with values contained within Angular metadata such as a Component or Directive decorator.

This is included via `assets` in `angular.json`:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n            \"assets\": [\r\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n              \"src/assets\",\r\n              \"src/login\"\r\n            ],\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using `ng serve` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` and calling **`curl http://localhost:4200/login/`**, the login page is returned.\r\n\r\nWhen using `ng serve` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild` or `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` and calling **`curl http://localhost:4200/login/`**, the index.html of the angular project is returned.\r\n\r\nThe application redirects to `/login/` if authentication is missing. This results in a redirect loop from / to /login (because angular router does not know about any `/login/` route).\r\n\r\nA work-around is to redirect directly to the `index.html` page ( **`curl http://localhost:4200/login/index.html`** works with both esbuild and the old setup), but this is looks a bit ugly.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No

stumbled upon this issue in the project in which we are reading css variables in the runtime, in the prod build they were doubled due to inline styles redundancy).\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nDo

Performance & Core Web Vitals","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/core and @angular/cli\r\n\r\n### Problems :\r\n\r\n- Using custom fonts from **Google Fonts** can significantly impact FCP, LCP and initial load performance in Angular applications.\r\n\r\n- Downloading fonts from Google servers adds **extra HTTP requests** and **latency**, slowing down initial paint times.\r\n\r\n- The **font swapping** has the potential to cause layout shifts and so impact Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution :\r\n\r\n- Introduce a **built-in** **mechanism** in Angular to **automatically downloads fonts** specified by their Google Fonts names (or similar identifiers) during the build process and **self-host fonts** within the application, eliminating the need for external font services like Google Fonts.\r\n\r\n- Utilize **preconnect**, **preload**, and **size-adjust** for optimal performance and seamless font rendering.\r\n\r\n### Benefits :\r\n\r\n- **Improved Performance:** Reduces reliance on external requests, minimizes layout shifts (thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust) , and enables efficient caching.\r\n\r\n- **Improved FCP and LCP:** Optimized fonts and proactive loading strategies contribute to significantly faster loading times and smoother user experiences.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced SEO:** Better Core Web Vitals can lead to higher search engine ranking and increased website traffic.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes exposure to external vulnerabilities and provides more control over font sources.\r\n\r\n- **Developer Experience:** Built-in font optimization in Angular improves developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAnyone interested is welcome to comment on what the proposed syntax and feature set will be.\r\n\r\nInspired by next.js automatic font self-hosting library (

It seems now certain initialization methods are getting called before content children exist in some cases?\r\n\r\nPrior to this update it looks like `_cacheRowDefs()` was not called until `ngAfterContentChecked()` which meant all content children queries had values. In `17.1.10` however this call now has a chance to run in `_outletAssigned()`.\r\n\r\n`_outletAssigned()` checks for the existence of: \r\n- `this._rowOutlet`\r\n- `this._headerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._footerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._noDataRowOutlet`\r\n\r\nHowever, when `_cacheRowDefs()` is called here (as a result of `_render()` getting called), it uses these `ContentChild` queries:\r\n- `this._contentHeaderRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentFooterRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentRowDefs`\r\n\r\nHowever, these are all undefined still when run with `17.1.0` or higher at the moment (at least when run in our library's storybook). It seems they are maybe getting called too early because of `_outletAssigned()`? When run in `17.0.6` or any early version this was never the case because these methods only were called after `ngAfterContentChecked()`. The problem here is those empty values get passed to `_getOwnDefs()`, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprivate _getOwnDefs<I extends {_table?: any}>(items: QueryList<I>): I[] {\r\n  return items.filter(item => !item._table || item._table === this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this method assumes items exist, but they are actually undefined in this instance an error gets thrown and no tables can load.\r\n\r\nI assume because `_render()` looks like it still gets called in `ngAfterContentChecked()` everything would be fine as long as `_getOwnDefs()` and possibly other internal methods were updated to handle null/undefined scenarios.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI am unsure how to recreate this at the moment. I assume it only occurs on a more old-school non-standalone component example perhaps? I wanted to open this ticket as this will prevent us from allowing anyone to update to `17.1.0` or higher until we can get something figured out here.\r\n\r\nOur extension of the CDK table is purely for styling much like the MatTable and its directives. We do not alter any of this logic or override any lower CDK functions.\r\n\r\nI will work on recreating this in a stackblitz and update this ticket when/if I can.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTables load like normal.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')\r\n    at MtrTable._getOwnDefs

In our communication to be able to identify which label we are talking about this description would be really helpful. \r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nAdd an extra parameter to `ng extract-18n` that would also generate the `<context context-type=\"description\">` tags for duplicated messages.\r\n\r\nAccording to `http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#context` I do not see any problem with adding one more XML tag to the `<context-group purpose=\"location\">`s, e.g.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<trans-unit id=\"3016960930275947563\" datatype=\"html\">\r\n  <source>Owner</source>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/detail/detail.component.html</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">81</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner label in detail form</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/search/search.component.html</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">54</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner label in search filter</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/detail/search-result-table.component.ts</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">111</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner table column header in search result table</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">Owner label in detail form</note>\r\n</trans-unit>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49564","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"extract-i18n: Extract `description` for every instance of duplicated messages\" (#49564)"},{"Id":"1637352009","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T11:32:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"49563","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): expose `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState`","State":"open","Body":"This commits adds `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` methods in `@angular/core` as public API and deprecated the same exported symbols in `@angular/platform-browser`.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED:  `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`.

Even in a completely fresh angular project (as generated by `ng new polyfill-test`) and the canonical browserslist (as generated by `ng generate config browserslist`), the generated main.js file contains `??` operators. The default browserslist allows for Firefox 60 (as confirmed by `npx browserslist`), which does not support `??` (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing).\r\n\r\nUsing newer functions (like `Object.fromEntries`) does also not generate the corresponding polyfills.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding (https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-browser-compatibility) transpiling down and generating polyfills should work out of the box. This issue has also been independently noticed on Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75750874/angular-cli-15-and-browserslist-are-targeting-the-incorrect-ecmascript-version).\n\n###

issues.\r\nIn particular, I'm using `vscode-jest-runner` extension, and when I use its codeLens option to run a single test, it fails if the components involved use i18n, because it can't find `$localize`, despite the type being listed in `tsconfig.spec.json`'s `types`. \r\nWhen running test architect from cli everything works.\r\nAt the moment my workaround is to explicitly initialize `$localize` in `test-setup.ts` with the old `import '@angular/localize/init';`, hoping this will not interfere when test are launched from cli (double initialization?).\r\nIs there any other way?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- use i18n in a component\r\n- test the component outside ng-cli\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI:

I understand it is for performance improvement, But for already existing big enterprise-level applications, with many developers, it poses a big problem. Since many devs are working, an import-based circular dependency can be easily inserted in any part of the code, and with the useful 'circular dependency warnings' removed, there is no way to find such issues. And these issues may cause application to actually break in production. Which causes a huge impact on our reputation with the customer. We tried the alternatives suggested, but no luck\r\n\r\n1) Eslint -> import/no-cycle -> Makes our linter in CI run for more than 1.5 hours and finally breaks\r\n14:55:00  Linting \"@abcd/mnop-efgh\"...\r\n16:27:07  Cannot contact xyz-slave1: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\nThis is probably because our application is very big\r\n\r\n2) Madge -> Only found the type-based circular dependencies and no other circular dependencies... It is able to detect all circ-deps for a smaller application, But since our app is huge it is probably not able to find anything relevant.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1) Keep the showCircularDependencies flag for development and not have it in production. In the angular.json we can have a warning, if showCircularDependencies is set to true, stating, \"Do not use in Production as it will slow the build\".\r\n\r\n2) Angular can have another script, which after running can let us know the circular dependency warnings. This script can be based on the build, used in Angular-13 or before... which finds circular dependencies. This script will be different from the build so no performance impact will be there.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs mentioned above eslint and madge were tried, but no value was added.

mentioned in the docs.\r\nI'd either try to refactor the code so that the context isn't lost by invoking the handler from the logic of the MatSlider component (and therefore switching the implementation context), or mention it into the docs so that users don't get perplexed by the weird context

Within that components, I have a mat-select, which is not displaying any options, as the title mentioned. When I click on it, the select field itself is focused and gets the correct classes, but the options overlay is not appearing.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that something is wrong with the handling of the overlay in combination with dynamically generated components. When checking the DOM, I could see that the overlay container was not added to the body. Outside of the dynamic component the exact same mat-select works as expected. I also tried to create a dialog within my dynamic component and it also works fine (overlay container is attached to the body).\r\n\r\nEvery other functionality within the component is working as well (root services, ngrx store, ...).\r\n\r\nThere are no console errors.\r\n\r\nModule imports contain MatSelectModule, MatInputModule & MatFormFieldModule.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I just missing something?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. add mat-select to popupComponent:\r\n```\r\n<mat-form-field appearance=\"fill\">\r\n\t<mat-select multiple [formControl]=\"statusFormControl\">\r\n\t\t<mat-option *ngFor=\"let status of statuses\" [value]=\"status\">{{ status.id }}</mat-option>\r\n\t</mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Generate Component with createComponent(), using a generic EnvironmentInjector:\r\n\r\n`const popupComponent: ComponentRef<PopupComponent> = createComponent(PopupComponent, {\r\n\tenvironmentInjector: this._environmentInjector\r\n});`\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Add data to the component and execute change detection:\r\n\r\n`component.instance.statuses = statuses;\r\ncomponent.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. bind content to map popup (might be a possible source for the bug as well):\r\n\r\n`mapMarker.bindPopup(popupComponent.location.nativeElement as Content);`\r\n\r\n\r\n5. when opening the popup on the map and clicking on the select, the highlighting is correct, but nothing else happens:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125544629/225877898-4a2c8117-ce56-41ac-9fc0-37570d2e91da.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nmat-options should show up\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-options notshowing up, overlay container not attached\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 102.8\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): mat-options not showing up on dynamically generated component\" (#26803)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-03-24T03:30:03.0449216Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2157}

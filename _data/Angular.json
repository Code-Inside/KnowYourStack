I am using the new experimental option for the `provideHttpClient()` - `withFetch()`, and the ng-select package (latest version 11.0.0) inside my app's navbar to search for users from the API (autocomplete).\r\n\r\nToday, I added a router guard (functional guard) to my main page. The guard is something like:\r\n `return inject(AuthService).login()`, which creates an HTTP request to the backend. The guard is working as expected, and I've been using this approach for years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the combination of `withFetch()` and the `authGuard` is causing a strange bug: The ng-select component is not working properly - it doesn't show a list of items (even though the API calls appear in the network tab), the CSS is a bit off (the input is on top of the placeholder), among other strange behaviors.\r\n\r\nJust by removing either `withFetch()` or the authGuard, everything works as expected. So, it seems the combination of the two is creating side effects on the ng-select component.\r\n\r\nI updated to Angular 16.1.6, but the bug persists. I have another app that works with ng-select, Angular 16, and authGuard without any issues. I have a lot of experience with Angular, and this is a strange one. I'm not sure if anyone will know the cause, especially without a reproduction of the bug. But if no one has a clue, I'll do my best to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo errors on the console at all.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 16.1.4 \\ 6\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\n\r\nElectron: 25\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI am running angular inside electron app, but this is not releated to Electron in my opinion, since I can also run the angular app in the browser directly (localhost:4200) and I see the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n- Everything is working as expected without the guard\r\n- If the guard is not using http request (ie, just returns of(true)) - no problem\r\n- No errors in the console, the http requests for the guard and the ng-select autocomplete is working and getting valid respones (200) using fetch api","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51181","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"withFetch() and router guard create random bug\" (#51181)"},{"Id":"1823667971","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-27T05:54:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"51183","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): add utility to enable deferred blocks for testing","State":"open","Body":"Adds the `ɵsetEnabledBlockTypes` utility that can be used when writing JIT tests using `defer` blocks.

defined as: `@Input() size: string = DEFAULT_SIZE;` for example, I get the following error: \"_TS2322: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'_\".\r\n\r\nBut Angular converts undefined values to the default value in such case, that's the point of the whole mechanism.\r\nI workaround the problem with `<some-component [size]=\"size!\"/>` but it doesn't feel right.\r\nIt worked before (v. 14), because the template compiler was less strict?\r\n\r\nCan Angular template compiler detect such cases and avoid this error?\r\nThanks.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

This also includes whitespaces and comment nodes that Angular produces during the rendering on the server. Those whitespaces and nodes must be present in the HTML generated by the server-side rendering process. This is also documented at: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#constraints.\r\n\r\nIn practice, some CDNs ([example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/auto-minify/)) have mechanisms to remove all comment nodes and spaces from all text nodes from HTML while serving the content (there are also cases where this type of optimization is performed at the build step). Those mechanisms are frequently enabled by default. This leads to situations where an application worked in dev mode correctly, but started failing in production. Since the production code is also minified, it makes it hard to look at the stack trace and identify the origin of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis feature requests proposes that we add a special detection mechanism for such cases. For example, we can do the following:\r\n\r\n- on the server, while serializing DOM, add a comment node to a well known location (e.g. as a first node in the `<body>`)\r\n- on the client (both in dev and prod modes), before starting hydration process, verify the presence of those \"marker\" nodes and throw an error if they are not present\r\n- we should also add an error guide for this error, so that the link to the guide is present in production mode\r\n\r\nOne of the examples where this issue becomes a hard-to-debug problem: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50133#issuecomment-1535713053","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51160","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hydration: detect when index.html is altered between the server and the client\" (#51160)"},{"Id":"1819024480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-24T19:41:43","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"51158","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Provide a diagnostic for negated `AsyncPipe` in ngIf expressions","State":"open","Body":"Negating an `AsyncPipe` in an `*ngIf` thrashes the layout because the pipe emits null immediately before checking the condition.

CSS nesting allows selectors to be used where declarations are expected. There's an IE7 hack where prefixing a declaration with a `*` causes that declaration to only be applied in IE7 due to a bug in IE7's CSS parser. However, it's valid for nested CSS selectors to start with `*`. So esbuild was incorrectly parsing these declarations and anything following it up until the next `{` as a selector for a nested CSS rule. This release changes esbuild's parser to terminate the parsing of selectors for nested CSS rules when a `;` is encountered to fix this edge case:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%; height: 1px; {\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that the syntax for CSS nesting is [about to change again](https://togithub.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7961), so esbuild's CSS parser may still not be completely accurate with how browsers do and/or will interpret CSS nesting syntax. Expect additional updates to esbuild's CSS parser in the future to deal with upcoming CSS specification changes.\n\n-   Adjust esbuild's warning about undefined imports for TypeScript `import` equals declarations ([#&#8203;3271](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3271))\n\n    In JavaScript, accessing a missing property on an import namespace object is supposed to result in a value of `undefined` at run-time instead of an error at compile-time. This is something that esbuild warns you about by default because doing this can indicate a bug with your code. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    console.log(styles.buton)\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    // styles.js\n    export let button = {}\n    ```\n\n    If you bundle `app.js` with esbuild you will get this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Import \"buton\" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in \"styles.js\" [import-is-undefined]\n\n            app.js:2:19:\n              2 │ console.log(styles.buton)\n                │                    ~~~~~\n                ╵                    button\n\n          Did you mean to import \"button\" instead?\n\n            styles.js:1:11:\n              1 │ export let button = {}\n                ╵            ~~~~~~\n\n    However, there is TypeScript-only syntax for `import` equals declarations that can represent either a type import (which esbuild should ignore) or a value import (which esbuild should respect). Since esbuild doesn't have a type system, it tries to only respect `import` equals declarations that are actually used as values. Previously esbuild always generated this warning for unused imports referenced within `import` equals declarations even when the reference could be a type instead of a value. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only warn in this case if the import is actually used. Here is an example of some code that no longer causes an incorrect warning:\n\n    ```ts\n    // app.ts\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    import ButtonType = styles.Button\n    ```\n\n    ```ts\n    // styles.ts\n    export interface Button {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.63`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n### [`v23.0.62`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n### [`v23.0.61`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n### [`v23.0.60`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Furthermore, I'm not sure if we need to optimize this code path to begin with, because it only does a shallow traversal of the `head` tag which is generally fast and is unlikely to have many direct descendants.\r\n\r\nFixes #25419.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25584","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): error during critical CSS inlining for external stylesheets\" (#25584)"},{"Id":"1818488234","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T07:19:36","Actor":"majoer","Number":"25575","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: \"link.prev?.setAttribute is not a function\" - CSP and <link rel=\"stylesheet\">","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nng build breaks when we combine ngCspNonce with a hard-coded style-sheet link in index.html.\r\n\r\nWe can replicate this in a new angular app. However, this problem first appeared for us in an Angular Universal app, with the following setup:\r\n- We add ngCspNonce to the app-root as explained in: https://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy\r\n- We also add some external style-sheets as links in index.html.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is where the bug occurs\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/index-file/inline-critical-css.ts#L149\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1.

This causes ES Modules in the output with non-configurable methods/properties. As a result, we cannot mock JS modules. This leads to tests that pull lots of external dependencies (utility functions, config objects etc.) that are not provided using the DI and hence cannot be stubbed using Angular DI.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nScaffold an app and use Jest as a testing tool.

But when we try using 'browser-esbuild' it's not working anymore. All of the chunk files get 503 error including the @vite/client and .angular/cache/vite altho main.js, pollyfills.js and scripts.js load successfully.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThis can be reproduced with a development environment inside docker container including our configuration from the description (a custom url inside 'allowed hosts' <e.g. 'my.custom.url'> and a base href <e.g. '/ui/foo' >). After the build is successful, navigate to the url my.custom.url/ui/foo and in the console you will see my.custom.url/chunk-123.js gets 503 error.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, cli, common, compiler\r\n... compiler-cli, core, forms, language-service, material\r\n... material-experimental, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                          Version\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect        0.1601.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular    16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core             16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics       16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics-cli   16.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular              16.1.3\r\nng-packagr                       16.1.0\r\nrxjs                             7.8.1\r\ntypescript                       4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25574","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular v16 esbuild ignores base href\" (#25574)"},{"Id":"1818138594","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-24T10:35:31","Actor":"cipchk","Number":"25572","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 16 esbuild: inline JavaScript is not enabled of less","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHope to keep `javascriptEnabled` enabled in esbuild, currently ng-zorro-antd still needs support for inline scripts.\r\n\r\nConfig differences between [esbuild](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/less-language.ts#L90) and [webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L272).\r\n\r\nA simple step to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Angular 16.1.x\r\nng new demo\r\nng add ng-zorro-antd\r\nng s --force-esbuild\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:\r\n\r\n```\r\n✘ [ERROR] Inline JavaScript is not enabled.

The documentation for this component is still poor, so it's entirely possible that I'm not understanding the proper use.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [YouTube documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters), `listType` can be `playlist` or `user_uploads`.  However, the Angular project will not build successfully when I attempt to set `listType` to any value.  There also doesn't seem to be a `ListType` enum exposed, like some of the other properties (such as `AutoPlay`, etc.).  This would be helpful in feeding it a proper value since it clearly doesn't like the strings `playlist` or `user_uploads`.\r\n\r\nLooking in the \"Type definitions for YouTube\", it seems like there _should_ be `ListType` type exported, but I'm not sure how to make use of it and I'm not seeing it in the `YT` namespace.  Interestingly, the index.d.ts file for the type definitions defines the first potential value for `ListType` as `player` - not `playlist`.  This seems to be inconsistent with the YouTube documentation.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n`<youtube-player [playerVars]=\"playerVars\"></youtube-player>`\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayerVars = {\r\n    autoplay: 1,\r\n    controls: 1,\r\n    list: 'LISTID',\r\n    listType: 'playlist',\r\n    modestbranding: 1\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFull support for the PlayerVars object, per the YouTube documentation\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nbuild errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypes of property 'listType' are incompatible.\r\n    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ListType | undefined'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.1.6\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(youtube-player): PlayerVars\" (#27528)"},{"Id":"1824286462","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-27T16:53:29","Actor":"Abdullah-Haroon004","Number":"27526","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkScrollable is working but its scroll-bar is not visible in IPAD Device and Iphone Devices.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe Scrolling feature is working on IPAD Devices as well as the drag-and-drop item scroll.

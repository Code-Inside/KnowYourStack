For most of them it is working fine, and by \"working\" I mean that VSCode shows the correct type (rather than `any`) when I hover over a use of the local variable inside the `ngFor` block.

This is an implementation of `HttpParameterCodec`\r\nwhich uses `encodeURIComponent` plus a number of manual post-processing\r\nsubstitutions to encode keys and values for x-www-form-urlencoded contexts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the logic of `HttpUrlEncodingCodec` is fatally flawed. Among\r\nother problems, the character '+' is left unencoded. In such contexts, '+'\r\nis interpeted as a space by any correct decoder, meaning that this\r\nimplementation actually changes values. This logic is indefensible, and\r\nappears to be the result of a copy/paste bug from angular.js encoding meant\r\nfor a different context.\r\n\r\nFixing this bug directly is challenging since existing backends may be\r\nrelying on Angular's broken behavior, so changing the default is a breaking\r\nchange and will need to be done in an Angular major version.

This is because loading such JS file requires these DOM\r\nglobals to exist in NodeJS globally too (and there is no support for DI mocking).\r\nSee: #30586. This is especially\r\nrelevant for libraries that do not want to use tsickle but ship SSR-compatible code.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for (1) is a TypeScript limitation as mentioned. This is\r\nthe related upstream ticket: microsoft/TypeScript#27519.\r\nDownleveling decorators to static properties fixes the issues, as\r\noutlined in (1) and (2), because we can defer metadata evaluation\r\nto avoid direct evaluation on file load. Additionally, we have more\r\ncontrol and can discard unnnecessary metadata information, like class\r\nmember types that are not needed by Angular at all see (2).\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why this hasn't been an issue in the past since we disabled\r\nthis as part of version 7. These issues didn't surface at a large scale because\r\nwe added a custom transformer to CLI projects and to `ng-packagr`. Those\r\ntransformers downleveled constructor parameters/ore removed decorators\r\nat all to fix (1) and (2). Also `emitMetadataDecorator` has been disabled\r\nby default in CLI projects. For bazel release output this didn't surface\r\neither because tsickle still ran by default in prodmode output.\r\n\r\nThis was never an ideal solution though, and we'd also like to not\r\nrun tsickle by default in the Bazel prodmode output. It was not ideal\r\nbecause we just applied workarounds at Angular compiler derivatives.\r\nIdeally, TypeScript would just emit proper metadata that isn't evaluated\r\nat top-level, but given they marked it as limitation and the decorator\r\nproposal is still stage 2, this won't happen any time soon (if at all).\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution is that we downlevel decorators (as previously done\r\nwith tsickle by default) as part of the Angular compiler (a level higher;\r\nand one below the actual TypeScript compiler limitation). This fixes\r\nthe issues with the common `forwardRef` pattern (1), and also fixes (2).\r\nIt also allows us to reduce code duplication in the compiler derivatives\r\n(e.g. ng-packagr), fixes the left-behind standalone ngc comsumers, and\r\nwe can disable tsickle in Angular bazel (as already done with this commit).\r\n\r\nThis technically fixes the `annotationsAs` Angular compiler option\r\nthat is currently not working as described since v7. i.e. Angular \r\ndecorators are downleveled to static fields **by default**.\r\n\r\nFixes #30106.

If the code change or is incorrect, the return type inference will reflect that.\r\n\r\nWhile it is acceptable in applications, as it will raise an error where the function is used if the types do not match anymore, it is more dangerous in a library, as the functions are not used directly. It can lead to unwanted breaking changes in the public API.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nTSLint has a rule to enforce functions' return type (and ESLint too, for the future migration):\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"rules\": {\r\n    \"typedef\": [true, \"call-signature\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could be added when doing `ng g library`.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy change as:\r\n- it won't impact applications: libraries already have a specific `tslint.json` due to `--prefix` option\r\n- it won't impact already created libraries as it only happens when generating a new one\r\n\r\nThis is a really easy thing to add, I can take care of the PR if Angular team signal is green.\r\n\r\nIf it is considered a too big step, it could be added only if the workspace is already using TypeScript `strict` mode (following the new `--strict` option in Angular >= 9). But I think as we are talking about libraries, it should really be the default: libraries authors must be stricter to avoid compatibility issues (`strict` mode should even be the default for libraries, but it would be another discussion).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17821","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enforce stricter types via lint when in strict mode\" (#17821)"},{"Id":"628350599","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T18:52:02","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17833","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devklit/build-angular): clean up SingleTestTransformLoader","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nMinor cleanup of SingleTestTransformLoader and fix interface issue which causes  #17823 to be red.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17833","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devklit/build-angular): clean up SingleTestTransformLoader\" (#17833)"},{"Id":"628451041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T13:47:38","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17835","RawContent":null,"Title":"wip! jsonc-parser","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17835","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"wip! jsonc-parser\" (#17835)"},{"Id":"627892123","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T13:06:26","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17829","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rollup to version 2.12.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | minor | [`2.11.2` -> `2.12.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/2.11.2/2.12.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup</summary>\n\n### [`v2.12.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;2120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v2.11.2...v2.12.0)\n\n_2020-05-31_\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Add an option `--waitForBundleInput` to let the build wait until all entry point files are available before starting ([#&#8203;3577](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3577))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3577](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3577): Wait for bundle input option ([@&#8203;Heerschop](https://togithub.com/Heerschop))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Everything seemed fine, but as soon as I started changing JSON files in my assets folder (assets/api/test.json) I noticed a problem. Webpack registers the change I make to the file, but the old file is still served. \r\n\r\nSay I add a record to the JSON file `{ \"foo\": \"bar\" }`, the compiler sees the change and starts compiling. After that the webpage is refreshed (like expected), but the JSON file is not updated, the previous version is still served. \r\n\r\nIn order to check if my project was the problem I created a new, empty, CLI project (Angular CLI 9.0.4). I am having the same issue here. It is not even picking up any now JSON files I add to the assets folder. It does add them in the build folder on a production build, but the files are missing on `serve`. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nSee [this minimal reproduction](https://github.com/RobinvanTienhoven/test-asset-loading).\r\nChange a line in the `assets/api/test.json`.

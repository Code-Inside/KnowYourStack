While such errors are generally caught by the framework, relying on the runtime's stack limit is unpredictable across different environments and engine states (e.g. varying stack sizes in different browsers or Node.js versions).\r\n\r\nThe deeply nested parentheses  can cause a stack overflow. While such URLs can be valid (e.g., `(a/(b/(c...)))`) and serialize to simple paths (e.g., /a/b/c), excessive nesting is unreasonable and likely malicious or accidental.\r\n\r\nLinear paths (e.g. /a/b/c/d) are parsed iteratively and do NOT trigger recursion. Only parentheses trigger recursion.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a recursion depth limit of 50. If parsing exceeds this depth, the router will now throw a specific `UNPARSABLE_URL` error with the message \"URL is too deep\". This ensures a deterministic failure mode that is easier for applications to handle than a crash or generic RangeError.\r\n\r\nThe limit of 50 is chosen as it should accommodate any reasonable application URL structure (including complex named outlets) while providing a safe upper bound against abusive payloads.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a refactor of the error state:\r\n\r\n* Before: RangeError (System says \"I'm out of stack memory\")\r\n* After: RuntimeError (Validator says \"Input is invalid\")\r\n\r\nThis provides:\r\n\r\n* Semantic Correctness: The error now correctly blames the input (\"URL too deep\"), not the environment (\"Stack full\").\r\n* Cross-Platform Consistency: The limit is the same in Chrome, Firefox, Node, and Deno, regardless of their internal recursion limits.\r\n* Fast Failure: We stop at depth 50 instead of depth ~15,000, saving those cycles (though CPU cost is negligible either way).\r\n\r\n\"wide\" URLs are now theoretically more expensive than \"deep\" URLs (because deep ones fail fast), but both are well within safe bounds for any reasonable input size.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66783","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): limit UrlParser recursion depth to prevent stack overflow\" (#66783)"},{"Id":"3862950445","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-28T00:10:32","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"66782","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(platform-browser): add `ROOT_STYLE_HOST` to configure Angular to bootstrap under a shadow root","State":"open","Body":"Exploring an alternative to https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66048, which has been stalled due to complicated tests which we've been struggled to debug.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66782","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-browser): add `ROOT_STYLE_HOST` to configure Angular to bootstrap under a shadow root\" (#66782)"},{"Id":"3862947735","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-28T00:09:14","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"66781","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [21.1.x]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular adev cross repo docs files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66781","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [21.1.x]\" (#66781)"},{"Id":"3861821610","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-28T00:08:47","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"66777","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(common): enables zoneless change detection in tests","State":"closed","Body":"Adds `provideZonelessChangeDetection` to TestBed configurations in  `ngComponentOutlet` , `ngOptimizedImage` , `ngTemplateOutlet` and `ngPlural`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [x] Other...

We currently use `initialNavigation: 'enabledBlocking'` in our SSR application with non-destructive hydration, and it works properly for our needs. However, we’d like to address the following diagnostic message:\n> `NG05001: Configuration error: found both hydration and enabledBlocking initial navigation in the same application, which is a contradiction.`\n\nWhen `initialNavigation: enabledBlocking` is removed, Angular falls back to `INITIAL_NAVIGATION` with the value `enabledNonBlocking`. Therefore, the initial render of the entire component tree starts to happen in parallel with the Router's initial navigation phase. Previously, routing happened first, and only then could the rendering of components start. This means that if any components implicitly expected some side-effects from the initial routing phase to already be finished, they might now encounter a race condition.\n\nThe core issue is that hydration requires non-blocking navigation, but we have a legitimate use case that relies on bootstrap-blocking behavior. Specifically, we need to extract URL-based parameters such as auth codes, coupons, and configuration data before they are potentially lost during any redirects. \n\nSome of our features depend on the `LOCATION_INITIALIZED` promise, which we observed Angular ignores when `enableBlocking` is not set. This can be seen in the source code, where Angular waits for `LOCATION_INITIALIZED` only if enabledBlocking is set, as shown at https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d9c980a958961629649769613adfd40a9cb0d505/packages/router/src/provide_router.ts#L441-L450\n\nThis is a critical change for us and impacts several important functionalities.\n\nWe'd prefer to adopt hydration for its performance and UX benefits without having to refactor our entire initialization logic. Also the new diagnostic in Angular 21 (NG05001) has introduced confusion for our community and library users, because it implies the configuration is invalid, but we haven’t observed issues yet.\n\nReferences:\n• Angular issue: Practical consequences of using enabledBlocking with non-destructive hydration (Angular 21 NG05001) https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66652\n• Angular issue: Show warning when withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation Is used with provideClientHydration https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59624\n• Angular PR: feat(platform-browser): Warns on conflicting hydration and blocking https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62963\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### 1. Public API to Dismiss NG05001 Diagnostic\nCould the Angular team provide a public API to dismiss or configure this diagnostic? This would allow us to continue using `enabledBlocking` alongside non-destructive hydration for applications that have legitimate use cases requiring both.\nIf this approach is viable, we'd be happy to contribute a PR ourselves if the team doesn't have bandwidth for this enhancement. 👍\n\n### 2. Alternative: Honor `LOCATION_INITIALIZED` Promise with Non-Blocking Navigation and Hydration\nIf exposing a public API to dismiss the diagnostic isn't feasible, could Angular take into account the `LOCATION_INITIALIZED` Promise even when navigation is non-blocking AND hydration is enabled, effectively delaying initial navigation until the Promise resolves?\nOur motivation: We need to extract information from the URL before the router processes it and navigation occurs, including:\n    - Auth nonce & code from 3rd-party login page redirect URLs\n    - Other async logic from our custom ConfigInitializers that affect various parts of the application\n Currently, enabledBlocking provides exactly the bootstrap timing we need, but it's incompatible with hydration.\n\n### 3. Recommended Angular APIs/Events/Hooks\nWhat Angular APIs, events, or hooks would the team recommend to achieve our goals while maintaining compatibility with non-destructive hydration?\nOur requirements are:\n    - Run custom async initialization logic that may affect routing decisions\n    - Maintain SSR with non-destructive hydration compatibility\n    - Achieve similar timing to what `enabledBlocking` provides (bootstrap blocked until navigation completes), but in a hydration-compatible way\n    \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe warning message is being ignored because it has not shown any observable effect on our daily operations.

The issue is not exception-based and may not always throw an error, which makes it harder\nto detect in production environments.\n\nThis is a parser-level denial of service condition caused by uncontrolled recursion. There is no\ndepth limit, recursion guard, or complexity check in the URL parsing logic.\n\nRelevant code paths:\n- `parseChildren()` → `parseParens()`\n- `parseParens()` → `parseChildren()`\n\nBecause this logic is part of a core framework component, it is expected to be safe-by-default.\nRelying on every application developer to defensively wrap router parsing logic in `try/catch`\ndoes not mitigate CPU exhaustion or event-loop blocking.\n\nThis affects server-side rendering and custom Node/Express integrations where `DefaultUrlSerializer`\nis used directly or indirectly.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nNo public repo required. The issue can be reproduced by calling:  const serializer = new DefaultUrlSerializer(); serializer.parse(url);  Where `url` contains deeply nested parentheses, for example: \"/((((((((((((((((((((((a))))))))))))))))))))))\"  Observed behavior: high CPU usage / hang / stack overflow depending on environment.\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nIn many cases no exception is thrown.\nObserved effects include:\n- Event loop blocking\n- High CPU usage\n- Stack overflow in some environments\n\nThis is not an exception-based failure.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is a classic uncontrolled recursion / resource exhaustion issue (CWE-674 / CWE-400).\n\nEven if higher-level frameworks catch errors, the lack of a recursion or depth guard in the router\nparser itself means a single crafted request can degrade availability.\n\nSuggested mitigation:\n- Introduce a maximum recursion depth\n- Add a parsing complexity guard\n- Fail fast on excessive nesting\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66757","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unbounded recursion in DefaultUrlSerializer.parse() can cause router-level DoS with crafted URLs\" (#66757)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3862593891","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T21:52:40","Actor":"deadmann","Number":"32371","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrate from 17 to 18","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nDear sir...

(caused breakage in Puppeteer tests for schematics).

The implementation leverages the Prettier CLI directly for a more robust and reliable formatting process.\r\n\r\nCloses #10777","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32367","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/cli): automatic formatting files modified by schematics\" (#32367)"},{"Id":"3858860559","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T07:41:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32364","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (21.1.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi44Ny4wIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuODcuMCIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6IjIxLjEueCIsImxhYmVscyI6WyJhY3Rpb246IG1lcmdlIiwiYXJlYTogYnVpbGQgJiBjaSIsInRhcmdldDogYXV0b21hdGlvbiJdfQ==-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32364","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance (21.1.x)\" (#32364)"},{"Id":"3858860145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T07:38:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32363","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi44Ny4wIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuODcuMCIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6Im1haW4iLCJsYWJlbHMiOlsiYWN0aW9uOiBtZXJnZSIsImFyZWE6IGJ1aWxkICYgY2kiLCJ0YXJnZXQ6IGF1dG9tYXRpb24iXX0=-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32363","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance (main)\" (#32363)"},{"Id":"3843728771","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T07:33:10","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"32349","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): support TypeScript isolatedDeclarations option","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other... Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nRecently, the Angular team said [on a panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpprrzvyqEc&t=445s)  that `isolatedDeclarations` can make a huge difference in build times, but we currently can't test it in the CLI.\r\n\r\nAngular CLI forcefully set both declaration and composite to false, which prevents the use of isolatedDeclarations as TypeScript requires at least one of these options to be true when isolatedDeclarations is set (TS5069 error):\r\n\r\n```\r\n✘ [ERROR] TS5069: Option 'isolatedDeclarations' cannot be specified without specifying option 'declaration' or option 'composite'. [plugin angular-compiler]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThis change allows the use of TypeScript's isolatedDeclarations compiler option by conditionally preserving the declaration and composite options when isolatedDeclarations is enabled.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32349","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): support TypeScript isolatedDeclarations option\" (#32349)"},{"Id":"3848164490","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T07:24:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32356","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update Windows CI jobs to use Node.js 24 for test execution","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32356","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update Windows CI jobs to use Node.js 24 for test execution\" (#32356)"},{"Id":"3849934250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T07:24:44","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32360","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): avoid secondary import wrapper in Vitest unless coverage is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"This commit optimizes the Vitest test runner by removing the secondary import wrapper for test entry points when code coverage is not enabled.

enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/monitor-workflows/enable-debug-logging), the CodeQL Action will now use more unique names when uploading logs from the Dependabot authentication proxy as workflow artifacts. This ensures that the artifact names do not clash between multiple jobs in a build matrix. [#&#8203;3409](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3409)\n- Improved error handling throughout the CodeQL Action. [#&#8203;3415](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3415)\n- Added experimental support for automatically excluding [generated files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github) from the analysis. This feature is not currently enabled for any analysis. In the future, it may be enabled by default for some GitHub-managed analyses. [#&#8203;3318](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3318)\n- The changelog extracts that are included with releases of the CodeQL Action are now shorter to avoid duplicated information from appearing in Dependabot PRs.

[CVE-2026-23745](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97).\n\nIt seems 20.x has been patched, however due to the patched version of pacote using node 20+ it breaks Angular's node compatibility and so has been deemed as won't fix (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32324). \n\nAngular 19.x still has LTS until May. Should this issue be covered by the LTS?\n\nIf not, what are the recommendations? Assuming updating to 20+ isn't feasible currently.\n\nIs it safe to use CLI 20.x with Core 19.x? \n\nThank you.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nnpx @angular/cli@19 new 19-test\nnpm audit\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n# npm audit report\n\ntar  <=7.5.3\nSeverity: high\nnode-tar is Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite and Symlink Poisoning via Insufficient Path Sanitization -

Before choosing it, moving to it or sticking with it, one needs to evaluate its quality / development status. Even if comparisons with alternatives may be ideal, having a rough idea of Angular's own quality would already help a lot._\r\n\r\nWhile Angular's ITS tracks lots of issues, unfortunately, the project is way too large to efficiently analyze even a small representative sample of its tens of thousands of issues. [The _Issues_ page](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues) shows a list with countless pages. As I write these lines, the one shown by default links to ticket #47905 , which at first sight may not even report an actual Angular issue. On the other hand, top actual issues like #45272 do not feature on that first page at all.\r\n\r\nBasically, the sort is random (newest tickets are listed first), and while other sorts are available, none really helps with evaluation.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBy far the best solution would start by migrating to a proper ITS engine. Most importantly, mature engines provide:\r\n\r\n- a way to set a (quite approximate) importance for each issue\r\n- tracking of ticket validity\r\n- tracking of issue resolution\r\n\r\nAtlassian Jira and JetBrains Youtrack are certainly the first options to evaluate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both of these are proprietary. Bugzilla is another option which is well ahead of GitHub, but - being written in Perl - may never reach maturity.\r\n\r\nOnce tickets have been migrated, triage of ideally all tickets is of course needed to take advantage of these new possibilities and enable more meaningful sorting and filtering.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAdding a page to the documentation treating Angular's status could also help. Such a page could link to the most important issues.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, GitHub provides a way to [\"pin\" a few issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository), allowing a most basic distinction between the very worst issues and... all the rest.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47914","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"No efficient way to evaluate quality/status\" (#47914)"},{"Id":"1427293699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-31T09:30:44","Actor":"jmwierzbicki","Number":"47905","RawContent":null,"Title":"Looking for a way to access/modify angular template parser","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler, core, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-browser, platform-server\n\n### Description\n\nHello. Is there any way to alter behavior of angular compiler? \r\n\r\nIn my project I have a case where we have `translate` directive, and sometimes we provide whole html code in its element body:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div translate>this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a></div>\r\n```\r\nthe issue is that such translation blocks may contain some invalid attributes or even directives - because of this we need to always add `ngNonBindable` in such cases. Recently we also found that sometimes our translation logic fails, as there might be some whitespaces trimmed by default. So we have to add another attribute: `ngPreserveWhitespaces` \r\n\r\nI was trying to add such attributes from `translate` directive level, but after studying angular compiler src, it is clear that it can not work, as these attributes are resolved during compilation time.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that would touch this subject, is that we would like to extract raw html template \"as is\" before it is compiled, and provide it in attribute like this:\r\n```\r\n<div translate pre-translation-data=\"this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a>\">this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a></div>\r\n```\r\nBeing able to do this would be huge help with translation of such texts because now we extract them from `nativeElement` which is not really fail-proof. \r\nIt would also open new way for our QA guys for locating certain elements in their E2E tests, without writing complicated CSS selectors.\r\n\r\nIf somebody could point me in right direction on how to achieve this, it would be huge help\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd possibility to use ngNonBindable and ngPreserveWhitespaces from directive level\r\nAdd possibility to access raw html template of directive/component child. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf such feature is already possible, please add some examples on documentation","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47905","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Looking for a way to access/modify angular template parser\" (#47905)"},{"Id":"1429364702","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-31T07:05:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"47922","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

It is thus now possible for a downstream-app to override a component's base-implementation in a lib. According to the docs I read, all you have to do is declare the same `selector`. Unfortunately, though, the subclass requires `template` or `templateUrl` -- without it, I get this error:\r\n```\r\n error NG2001: component is missing a template\r\n```\r\nMy app-code doesn't have access to the lib's template-file (declared there via `templateUrl`) and IMHO I should not be forced to re-declare the template, if I do not want to replace it (but inherit it the way it is in the super-component).\r\n\r\nThe component-class contains the UI-logic. It should be easily possible for a downstream-lib/-app to customize this logic, i.e. override protected/public methods, without touching the UI (i.e. without re-declaring a template).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMake the `@Component(...)`-annotation's `template` and `templateUrl` optional for component-subclasses. A component-subclass should easily be able to override UI-logic without providing its own template.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWe tried to extract the UI-logic from the component into a stateful service which is associated 1-to-1 with its component. This, however, doesn't work either -- hence, I opened this other feature-request: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47899","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47900","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[FR] Make components subclassable without template\" (#47900)"},{"Id":"1426693262","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T05:20:23","Actor":"nlmarco","Number":"47899","RawContent":null,"Title":"[FR] Introduce component-scope and custom scopes in DI","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, all services that are declared on the module-level are singletons. It is not possible to my knowledge to have a different lifecycle, for example to have multiple stateful service-instances, each associated with a component.\r\n\r\nWhen declaring a service-provider on the component-level, this is possible with `@Host()`, but then it is impossible for downstream-projects to override the service-implementation-class in their modules. The provider declared in `@Component(...)` wins over any provider-declaration in any module.\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle should be independent from the type-declaration! It should be possible to somehow (e.g. using `@Host()`) declare a local instance of the service, but still use the type declared in the module's provider.\r\n\r\nBesides this concrete use-case, Angular should support custom scopes, just like Java's CDI does. With the current service-architecture in Angular (i.e. every service being either a singleton or not being overridable by downstream-projects), it is most often impossible to implement a stateful service.\r\n\r\nI also tried using a custom factory and access the `Injector`, but I saw in the debugger, that my factory is not consulted, if there is already a service-instance existing. I therefore cannot put the lookup-logic (of whether to reuse an existing instance or create a new instance for my current situation) into my own factory.\r\n\r\nIn Java's CDI, a current thread running can enter (and exit) custom scopes manually and access the proper injected service-instance having declared an active scope.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n1. Make `@Host()` work with services declared on the module-level. If a component declares `@Host()` it should get its own *instance* of the service, but the class-declaration should be taken from the module and thus still be overridable by a downstream-module. The child-components should automatically (or if needed with an additional `SkipSelf()`) use the service-instance of their parent-container (recursively). This would solve our immediate problem of not being able to associate a stateful service-instance with a component in a 1-1-relation.\r\n2. Introduce custom scopes just like Java's CDI does.\r\n3. A provider could -- additionally to the `useFactory` -- be declared with a newly introduced `useRegistry`. In contrast to the factory, the registry is consulted directly and it is up to the registry whether it wants to return an existing instance or create a new one. The registry-implementation needs access to the current injection-situation, of course. I'm not sure, but this may be possible via getting the current `Injector` as one of the `deps`. Since my factory wasn't consulted, if the instance already existed, I didn't analyse this further.\r\n4. Just in case, this is not yet possible: The injection-point should be accessible to the registry, just like in CDI (see `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint`).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI didn't find any alternative, but maybe I overlooked something. Please let me know, if I did!\r\n\r\nAs alternative, we could (and currently do) use stateless services, because the service-instances are singletons. With this approach they can be overridden (replaced by another implementation) downstream (the app might need another implementation than provided by default by the lib).\r\n\r\nStateless services suck for what we want to achieve. It's like writing a procedural language (e.g. C) -- but we like OO for a reason :smirk:\r\n\r\nDeclaring the service in `@Component` is not possible, because we then cannot override the service-implementation downstream.

The `executeBrowserBuilder` function from the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder accepts the `transforms` object as an optional argument at the end with the `webpackConfiguration` property.

Only a few milliseconds to prevent flashing menus when you just move the mouse around. The user can still click on a nested item to trigger the menu instantly. This will improve the UX. It's really annoying if the menus are flashing.\r\n\r\nYou can test my suggested behavior in other proven menus like in Windows 10. Just open a folder and open the context menu. You'll see that the nested menus don't open immediately. They are delayed. Same behavior in VSCode. A shorter delay than the Windows menus, but they are delayed. And I think we should implement this for the mat-menus too.\r\n\r\n|mat-menu| vs-code |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![mat-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60390085/198579985-20aba53a-ee97-4d20-a748-fb9cae75a78d.gif) | ![vscode-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60390085/198579999-db1003dd-746a-4ede-8e08-cbd6a85ad38d.gif) |\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/menu/examples\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n- Delay nested menu on hover.\r\n- Open nested menu instantly on click.\r\n- Delay nested menu before close (hover leave).\r\n- Implement it with fixed delay time or as an option property with default value (the time in ms.

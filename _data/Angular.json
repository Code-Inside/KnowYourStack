But unfortunately, I encountered several issues, I partially could manage to overcome, but some of them are so serious, that finally we decided, to not continue with enabling hydration in a production environment!\n\nFirst, I've to say, that the requirements for Angular to do a successful hydration are quite strict. Honestly they feel over the top! From my perspective, Angular behaves far too picky in this regards, leading to the whole app bailing out if some requirements aren't met. Below just the most important examples, I came across while trying to prepare our app becoming hydration ready (there were even more but rather negligible issues I won't mention, as we could at least somehow deal with them):\n\n**1. Markup Validity**\nAccording to https://angular.dev/guide/hydration#valid-html-structure , Angular expects a valid html markup for rehydration. But in fact, a table without `<tbody/>` is not really invalid markup! Same for other things like having an anchor inside a heading. Of course i agree, those things should be avoided, but it's not invalid per se. Hence, this shouldn't be a reason for Angular to break app execution while rehydrating. As this requirement can be met quite easily by updating the markup, I don't assess it as impacting, but it's still causing risk of breaking the app.\n\n**2. Markup differences on client-side**\nAngular Client Hydration demands, that server-side rendered markup **must not** become altered / be different before rendering / trying to rehydrate the app on client-side. Even though I partially understand this requirement, it's really difficult and partially even impossible to guarantee there won't be any changes made to the SSR markup before hydration. \n\nFor example, we have several scenarios, where the app renders markup on sever-side optimized for mobile as well as desktop breakpoints. Usually, we try to implement responsive layouts purely based on CSS, but in some cases, it simply doesn't work. Worst case we'll end up with having some parts of the layout duplicated, one for desktop and one for mobile breakpoint, so once the page is being rendered in the browser before the app initializes, there won't be an ugly flash caused by restructuring the markup after breakpoint could become properly evaluated by client-side logic. \nKeep in mind, that it's not possible on server-side to determine the breakpoint / viewport dimensions, once page is being rendered in the browser.\nEven with small differences, like when a link would become rendered server-side as an `<a/>` tag, but on client-side it would become changed to a `<button/>`, Angular starts to duplicate the view elements, leaving the SSR rendered anchor in the DOM but just appending a new button, instead of replacing the anchor. In this case we had to turn off rehydration for the affected component by applying `ngSkipHydration` directive, in order to solve the problem. I fully get the point, that in such scenario Angular anyway needs to re-render the component view, but it would be far better, if it would just recognize the difference and simply re-render the view in a correct way, instead of leaving orphaned SSR-markup in the view, if hydraton isn't explicitly configured to skip hydration for this particular component.\n\nBut what finally lead to the decision not being able to enable hydration in production was the fact, that when loading the page with having GTM included, and 3rd party script includes were added **before** the app starting to rehydrate, app execution broke just because markup was altered due to the inserted script tag! Same could happen when running A/B testing experiments, that by nature will also alter page contents.\nI think it's absolutely clear that every professional enterprise website has to make use of tracking, accomplished by injecting 3rd party scripts into the page. That's common practice and cannot be avoided, as it's simply a business demand! And I don't see any chance to prevent those external scripts being injected **after** Angular hydration has been done. Hence we cannot guarantee, the app to continue working as expected while enabling hydration, with still continuing to inject 3rd party script scripts modifying the DOM. \n\nI highly appreciate all the recent efforts, Angular team spent on improving SSR capabilities, but with the current state of maturity, I cannot assess Client Hydration being production ready. I hope you get my points and also agree, that hydration feature needs to be less strict and more forgiving, not leading to a full app execution failure in case some requirements aren't met, instead handling such cases gracefully by just recreating the affected markup like it would be without using hydration.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.8\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.8\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router, ssr\n... youtube-player\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.8\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.8\n@angular/google-maps            18.2.8\n@schematics/angular             18.2.8\nng-packagr                      18.2.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59171","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Impacting issues preventing to use Angular client Hydration in production\" (#59171)"},{"Id":"2735447821","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-12T10:08:53","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"59167","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59167","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.4\" with changelog.\" (#59167)"},{"Id":"2735034180","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-12T06:59:32","Actor":"htaebi","Number":"59163","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update anatomy-of-components.md","State":"open","Body":"write selector of UserProfile Component\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Description\n\nWith HRM the styles of component are loading in the browser through `link` tag instead of `style` and it seems this is the key problem for component initialization: now Angular calls **`ngAfterViewInit` before** the browser has **loaded the component styles**.\n\nIt leads (could lead) to **break an application behavior** much.\nThe logic of `ngAfterViewInit` can, for example, depend on the size of a component which is set by the styles.\n\nTo reproduce the bug just stop at the breakpoint in empty `ngAfterViewInit` method and look on the component tag in the DOM - **there are no component styles applied at this moment**.\n\nRelated issue: \"Angular 19: Issue with Style Flickering When Switching Views (ng serve) #59058\".\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

Currently Angular supports web workers, but not worklets, this makes us unable to make use of Angular's Typescript and bundling support when writing a worklet (i.e. we have to write the worklet in pure Javasctript, or deal with compiling and bundling ourselves).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport worklet like web workers. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nFor now we have come to a hacky workaround:\n\n1. Write the worklet as if it's a web worker. This is perfecly supported by Angular. Now the problem is, to load the compiled worker script, we don't have a trivial way to get its URL.\n\n2. Wrap the worker code like this:\n\n```js\nif (typeof self !== \"undefined\") {\n  postMessage(self.location.href);\n} else {\n  // do the worklet thing\n}\n```\nWhen `self` is not `undefined`, we know this script is loaded as a webworker (in a worklet context it would be `undefined`). In this case, send the script's location by `postMessage`.\n\n3. When trying to load the worklet, first load it as a web worker, wait for it to report the location, then terminate the worker and use the location to load the worklet.\n\nE.g. load an audio worklet:\n```typescript\n// probe worker url\nconst worker = new Worker(\n  new URL(\"path/to/the/worker\", import.meta.url),\n);\n\nconst url = await new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {\n  worker.onmessage = (e) => {\n    resolve(e.data);\n    worker.terminate();\n  };\n\n  worker.onmessageerror = reject;\n});\n\nawait audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule(url);\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59148","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Worklet support\" (#59148)"},{"Id":"2732547087","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-11T10:43:07","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"59146","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): avoid unnecessary `Promise.all` in `ApplicationInitStatus`","State":"open","Body":"\r\nThis commit refactors the `ApplicationInitStatus` class to avoid an unnecessary `Promise.all` when executing application initializers.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59146","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): avoid unnecessary `Promise.all` in `ApplicationInitStatus`\" (#59146)"},{"Id":"2732452669","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-11T10:08:15","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"59144","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support application-level providers in server rendering utilities","State":"open","Body":"\n### **Description**\n\nThe current SSR rendering utilities, [`renderModule`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L267) and [`renderApplication`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f3729cec87ac3b9c2798be604dd2425535f8fb66/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L302), allow adding **only platform-level providers**, not application-level providers.  \n\nDue to this limitation:\n1. It is not possible to reuse the same platform instance across multiple requests, instead of we destroy and recreating it for each request.\n2. Application-specific providers cannot be effectively scoped, which can lead to unintended behavior for request-specific tokens.\n\n### **Proposed solution**\nBy enabling **application-level dependency injection tokens**, we can better distinguish application-specific providers from platform-level ones. \n\nFor example, tokens such as the below could be scoped truly to the **application level** instead of being treated as platform-level providers.:\n- [`REQUEST`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f3729cec87ac3b9c2798be604dd2425535f8fb66/packages/core/src/application/platform_tokens.ts#L30)\n- [`INITIAL_CONFIG`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f3729cec87ac3b9c2798be604dd2425535f8fb66/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L57)\n\n\n\nThis change would beneficial to:\n- Improve DI scoping for SSR environments.\n- Allow cleaner separation of **request-specific** and **platform-specific** providers.\n- Prevent issues where shared platform instances inadvertently mix providers across multiple requests.\n\n\n#### **Related Files**\n- [`renderModule`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L267)\n- [`renderApplication`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f3729cec87ac3b9c2798be604dd2425535f8fb66/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L302)\n\n\n### **Use Cases**\n1. Using the `REQUEST` token for handling request-specific logic.\n2. Defining `INITIAL_CONFIG` at an application level to avoid platform-level pollution.\n3.

issue","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIn an Angular Server-Side Rendering (SSR) application, I observed unexpected behavior during the ng build process. Specifically:\n\n- The ng build step attempts to execute all the code within the route resolve functions. While this behavior might be expected in a pre-rendered page setup, it does not align with expectations for a server-side rendered application, where the resolve should execute at runtime on the server, not during the build phase.\n- This issue appears to be isolated to the route defined as path: '**'. Only this wildcard route’s resolve functions are executed during the build process, which seems incorrect and inconsistent with the behavior of other routes.\n\nThis behavior poses significant problems for applications relying on internal APIs, as it results in build failures if the APIs are inaccessible from the build environment.\n\nNote that changing the renderMode in the server routes doesn't change any behavior in this regard.\n\nThe issue was identified while building the application in a GitHub workflow using ubuntu-latest as the runner. Our internal API, which is accessible only within the internal network, was unreachable during the build process.\nLuckily it doesn't terminate the build, but it still feels like an unexpected behavior.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Clone the provided [minimal reproduction repository](https://github.com/captainDuckay/resolver-problem).\n2. Attempt to build the application using ng build with the provided configuration.\n3. Observe that the resolve function in the route with path: '**' executes during the build step, causing it to fail if the API is unreachable.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nFor a server-side rendered application:\n1. Resolve functions should execute at runtime on the server, not during the build step.\n2. The build process should only package the application for deployment, without executing runtime code such as route resolves.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/captainDuckay/resolver-problem\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR Pr {\n  headers: r {\n    headers: Map(0) {},\n    normalizedNames: Map(0) {},\n    lazyInit: undefined,\n    lazyUpdate: null\n  },\n  status: 0,\n  statusText: 'Unknown Error',\n  url: 'https://blablablalbatest.test/api/testdata',\n  ok: false,\n  type: undefined,\n  name: 'HttpErrorResponse',\n  message: 'Http failure response for https://blablablalbatest.test/api/testdata: 0 undefined',\n  error: TypeError: fetch failed\n      at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:13392:13\n      at a.invoke (file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:3:6715)\n      at l.run (file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:3:1985)\n      at file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:4:576\n      at a.invokeTask (file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:3:7341)\n      at l.runTask (file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:3:2628)\n      at R (file:///Users/not/WebstormProjects/repro-app/.angular/prerender-root/21ff0b3d-ccbd-48cc-a58c-56f355dc6a25/polyfills.server.mjs:3:9382)\n      at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5) {\n    [cause]: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND blablablalbatest.test\n        at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookupall [as oncomplete] (node:dns:120:26) {\n      errno: -3008,\n      code: 'ENOTFOUND',\n      syscall: 'getaddrinfo',\n      hostname: 'blablablalbatest.test'\n    }\n  }\n}\nBrowser bundles      \nInitial chunk files   | Names            |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-42OR2LGY.js     | -                | 138.27 kB |                41.48 kB\nmain-V7QEP3S4.js      | main             | 123.27 kB |                31.88 kB\npolyfills-FFHMD2TL.js | polyfills        |  34.52 kB |                11.28 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css   | styles           |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                      | Initial total    | 296.06 kB |                84.63 kB\n\nLazy chunk files      | Names            |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-ITHPYWXR.js     | error-component  | 312 bytes |               312 bytes\nchunk-YSOHETL2.js     | test-component   | 309 bytes |               309 bytes\n\n\nServer bundles       \nInitial chunk files   | Names            |  Raw size\nserver.mjs            | server           | 844.42 kB |                        \nmain.server.mjs       | main.server      | 633.63 kB |                        \npolyfills.server.mjs  | polyfills.server | 268.60 kB |                        \nchunk-6GZ6XUNF.mjs    | -                | 136.71 kB |                        \nchunk-X2SEQXRR.mjs    | -                |   2.41 kB |                        \nchunk-GFUZYSQG.mjs    | -                |   1.24 kB |                        \n\nLazy chunk files      | Names            |  Raw size\nchunk-EJSJJTUO.mjs    | xhr2             |  12.14 kB |                        \nchunk-TNO4MGIL.mjs    | xhr2             |  12.07 kB |                        \nchunk-A4T2JHCR.mjs    | error-component  | 375 bytes |                        \nchunk-EBTR7VEV.mjs    | test-component   | 372 bytes |                        \n\nPrerendered 0 static routes.\nApplication bundle generation complete.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.27.7 - 10 Dec 2024\n\n-   We are rolling out a change in December 2024 that will extract the CodeQL bundle directly to the toolcache to improve performance. [#&#8203;2631](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2631)\n-   Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.20.0.

However, it used to work well in browser, as it has heuristics to learn the environment where the code is executed.\n\nWe have switched to new builder as soon as it was released with Angular 17. So it seems the breaking change is introduced in v19.\n\nAfter migration to Angular v19, it looks like `ng serve` tries to execute/analyze the code during build stage and falls into a branch, which is intended for NodeJS environment.\n\nProbably, it is related to server-side rendering optimizations introduced in version 19, which makes development server execute the code.\n\nI would be grateful if there is any workaround to set development server behavior similar to what existed in v18.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create new project with Angular v19\n2. Install typings for node-forge: `npm i @types/node-forge`\n3. Import and use forge in any component. Example:\n\n    ```typescript\n    // other imports\n    import * as forge from 'node-forge';\n    \n    @Component({/* ... */})\n    export class AppComponent {\n      title = 'tmp-ng';\n      something = forge.util.isArray([]);\n    }\n    ```\n\n5. `ng serve`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nX [ERROR] The package \"crypto\" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.

In the terminal, I need to provide colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary. For each one, I specify a single color, like #ff9500, because that's what I want.\n\n`What HEX color should be used to generate the M3 theme? It will represent your primary color palette. (ex. #ffffff) **#005dba**\nWhat HEX color should be used represent the secondary color palette? (Leave blank to use generated colors from Material) **#005dba**\nWhat HEX color should be used represent the tertiary color palette? (Leave blank to use generated colors from Material) **#005dba**`\n\n However, when generating the theme, I see that it creates color palettes, but when I try to get just my color, I use **`--mat-sys-primary`.** Unfortunately, it appears significantly darker (#8c5000), and I don't know which variable the color is actually hidden under. I have the impression that due to the low contrast, it is being artificially darkened. However, I selected the option not to generate mixins with high contrast. I would like to be able to use exactly that color without worrying about contrast. Currently, I am forced to manually change all the system token colors because the generated palette still interferes too much with what I want to achieve, taking away the flexibility I need in this case.\n\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nIt would be great to be able to specify in the terminal that I want exactly the colors I mention, without any interference.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30167","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theme-generator): Add possibility to force custom color @angular/material:theme-color\" (#30167)"},{"Id":"2733260497","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-11T16:16:19","Actor":"theSumit67","Number":"30166","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(AngularAnimations): Detached dom nodes with material component on navigation","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have a very basic app in Angular + Material version 14. \n\nOn one page I have mat-tabs and a button which navigates to a blank component destroying the previous component.

For example, when a date is already selected and then the time is selected, the date portion of the value will be reset to the current date.\n\nThe [documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/timepicker/overview#integration-with-matdatepicker) only demonstrates the integration via `ngModel`. Consequently, it is unclear to me whether it should also work with `FormControl`. Based on the description, I would have expected it. If it is explicitly not supported, I suggest that a corresponding hint should be added since using Reactive Forms is one of the most common ways for managing the values of inputs.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-qszwe9ry?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample%2Fexample.component.ts](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-qszwe9ry?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample%2Fexample.component.ts)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

The displayed value will display the _current date_ and the selected time instead of the _selected date_.\n3. Select a date that is not the current date. The displayed date will display _0:00_ as the time instead of _selected time_.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1.

Selections in the `Timepicker` change the time portion of the `FormControl`, but keep the selected date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1.

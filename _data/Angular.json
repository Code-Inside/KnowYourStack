This prevents the parent from receiving the emitted event and handling it, effectively blocking the flow of communication between components.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nUse app.component.ts as a child component that emits an event inside a promise using EventEmitter.\ncrate a parent component, and listen to the emitted event and process it (e.g., resolve or reject the promise).\nObserve that the parent never receives the event, and the subsequent logic in the child component is not executed.\n\nExample Code:\n\nChild Component (TS):\n```\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrl: './app.component.css',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'test';\n  count: number = 0;\n\n  @Output() counterIncrementedEventEvent = new EventEmitter<any>();\n\n  protected async check() {\n\n    await new Promise<any>((resolve, reject) => {\n      console.log(\"here reach\")\n      this.counterIncrementedEventEvent.emit({ resolve, reject });\n    });\n\n    console.log(\"here doesnt reach\")\n    this.count++;\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nParent Component (HTML):\n`<app-root (counterIncrementedEventEvent)=\"counterIncrementedEvent($event)\"></app-root>`\n\nParent Component (HTML): \n```\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { AppComponent } from '../app.component';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-parent',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [AppComponent],\n  templateUrl: './parent.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css'],\n})\nexport class ParentComponent {\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\n\n  async counterIncrementedEvent($event: any) {\n    console.log(\"Handling event in ParentComponent...

This lack of functionality can complicate state management in applications where signals may need to revert to their original state after changes. Developers are left to implement custom solutions, which can lead to inconsistencies and increased complexity in the codebase.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCould you implement a built-in method for Angular Signals that allows developers to reset a signal to its default value? This method could be named `reset()` and restore the signal to its value when first initialized.\n\nExample Usage:\n\n```\nx = signal(5); // x = 5\n\nx.set(999); // x = 999\n\nx.reset(); // x = 5\n```\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n**Manual Default Tracking:** \nDevelopers currently have to manually track the default values and reset the signals accordingly, which can lead to repetitive code and increased maintenance overhead.\n\n**Wrapper Services:** \nSome teams may create wrapper services to encapsulate the logic of resetting signals, but this adds unnecessary complexity and reduces the straightforwardness of using signals.\n\n**Custom Reset Functions:** \nWriting individual reset functions for each signal can be a temporary workaround, but it is not scalable for larger applications and can lead to inconsistencies.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58715","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Resetting Angular Signals to Default Values\" (#58715)"},{"Id":"2668334606","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T12:03:39","Actor":"stefan-pavlovic-ded","Number":"58718","RawContent":null,"Title":"The documentation for ng serve proxy is incomplete","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThis part of documentation https://angular.dev/tools/cli/serve#proxying-to-a-backend-server is incomplete or maybe incorrect.

Here’s an example to illustrate this behavior:\n\n```ts\nimport { Component, PipeTransform, Pipe } from '@angular/core';\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'myPipe',\n  standalone: true,\n})\nexport class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('MyPipe');\n  }\n\n  transform(value: string) {\n    return value.toLowerCase();\n  }\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [MyPipe],\n  template: `\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {}\n\nbootstrapApplication(App);\n```\n\nThe console output for this example is:\n```\nMyPipe\nMyPipe\nMyPipe\nMyPipe\n```\n\nThis behavior has a performance impact when the pipe involves initialization logic or injects services. For example, consider a pipe that performs expensive computations during its construction.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an option in the `@Pipe` decorator to specify that the pipe should be treated as a **singleton** within the template. This could work like this:\n\n```ts\nimport { Component, PipeTransform, Pipe } from '@angular/core';\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'myPipe',\n  standalone: true,\n  singleton: true // <---- Ensures only one instance per template\n})\nexport class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('MyPipe');\n  }\n\n  transform(value: string) {\n    return value.toLowerCase();\n  }\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [MyPipe],\n  template: `\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n    {{ 'Hello' | myPipe }}\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {}\n\nbootstrapApplication(App);\n```\n\nWith this change, the console output would become:\n```\nMyPipe\n```\n\nThis ensures only one instance of the pipe is created per template, reducing unnecessary overhead while maintaining the current behavior for pipes where multiple instances are desired.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n```ts\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'myPipe',\n  standalone: true,\n  provideInTemplate: true // <---- Ensures only one instance per template\n})\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Add Template-Scoped Singleton Option for Pipes\" (#58717)"},{"Id":"2668020657","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T10:53:19","Actor":"ct-dixit","Number":"58716","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular-appComponent error.

I created an element class with `createCustomElement()`, added it to the list of custom elements, created the element and rendered it with `appendChild`. The element rendered and worked fine.\n\nThen I removed the element from the DOM and rendered it again in the same place (I didn't create a new element). Now the element rendered, but lost some styles and doesn't respond to events anymore (I just added show/hide button inside there for testing).\n\nFor the main component of the element I used `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`. So when the element renders for the third time (not the second!) I get the error `Shadow root cannot be created on a host which already hosts a shadow tree.`. If I set the main component to ViewEncapsulation.Emulate (the default), there is no error, but the element still behaves incorrectly and loses styles.\n\nIt is clear why the error occurs only on the third render: this is due to the [mechanism](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/elements/src/component-factory-strategy.ts#L138) that allows not to destroy the component if it was moved to the DOM (if `DESTROY_DELAY` did not pass between the destruction and the call).\n\nIt is also clear why the element does not work correctly after re-rendering. Angular Elements completely kills the component after it was removed from the DOM (with `DESTROY_DELAY` delay). This element can no longer be used, and its re-rendering (`connectedCallback` function) leads to errors.\n\nI think it is strange that the element can no longer be used after it was removed from the DOM. Regular HTML elements don't behave like that. I can remove and place an element as many times as I want, and it will work correctly. If I try to place the same element again, then by default it will be removed from the previous place and added to the new one.\n\nI need to use the element after it is removed from the DOM, because it stores its current state (I make tabs in my application). Yes, I can bypass the removal from the DOM and use `hidden`, but I would not like to resort to such a crutch.\n\nThere are two buttons in the reproduction:\n- Toggle web component — adds or removes a web component (appendChild, removeChild). It generates errors.\n- Toggle — a button inside an Angular element, which is only needed to check that the component responds to events.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

outside component","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThere's a different behavior in animations of component, when i change the input signal inside the component, and outside of it.\nI made an accordion component (angular18) with lazy loading of it's body content and smooth animation of opening and closing. So it works pretty well when i toggle it from inside (by clicking on header), but when i toggle it from outside - it doesn't open smoothly (but closes smoothly).\nOther animations on squares, added for test, works fine, problem only with height animation.\n\nWe found a solution: if we use  [@content]=\"($isOpen | async) ? ... where  $isOpen = toObservable(this.isOpen); - it works fine, so i think there's a bug with signals.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rjsmkv\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\naccordion opens immediately after transition time, not smoothly.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58701","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Animations of height when changed input signal outside component\" (#58701)"},{"Id":"2664006016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-16T08:33:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58698","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): expose component instance in NgComponentOutlet","State":"open","Body":"Exposes the current instance of the component in the `NgComponentOutlet` directive.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58698","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): expose component instance in NgComponentOutlet\" (#58698)"},{"Id":"2663703334","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-16T03:08:05","Actor":"NateRadebaugh","Number":"58697","RawContent":null,"Title":"Strictly typed FormGroup should have stictly-typed \"get\" accessor","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n> https://angular.dev/guide/forms/typed-forms\n\nFor instance:\n```ts\nprivate formBuilder = inject(NonNullableFormBuilder);\nconstructor() {\n  const formGroup = this.formBuilder.group({\n    someField: [\"\"],\n  });\n  const control1 = formGroup.controls.someField.value; // works with no issues\n  const control2 = formGroup.get(\"someField\").value; // Object is possibly 'null'.\n}\n```\n\nThe `get` method is typed as follows:\n\n```ts\nget<P extends string | readonly (string | number)[]>(path: P): AbstractControl<ɵGetProperty<TRawValue, P>> | null;\n```\n\nIt seems like something here should be smarter in limiting the path of `P` to include something related to the actual keys of the form group. It should be smart enough to know that the result is not `null` if the `path` is a `keyof TRawValue`, since that means it'd always be there.\n\n```ts\ntypedGet: <P extends Extract<keyof T, string> | readonly (string | number)[]>(\n    path: P,\n  ) => P extends Extract<keyof T, string>\n    ? AbstractControl<ɵGetProperty<T, P>>\n    : null;\n```\n\nIs this something angular could reasonably support?

Unfortunately testing the prompt is a little awkward, as Inquirier does not provide useful APIs in this space. I evaluated `@inquirer/testing`, but ultimately decided that was more intended for testing custom Inquirer prompts, not mocking usage of standard prompts. Schematics APIs do not provide a useful way to inject additional data like a mock, so instead I had to do this through a `setPrompterForTestOnly` function.

To avoid this misalignment, all component stylesheet HMR functionality is now disabled when in JIT mode.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28886","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): fully disable component style HMR in JIT mode\" (#28886)"},{"Id":"2663811026","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T16:59:44","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"28879","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix hanging terminal when `browser-sync` is not installed","State":"closed","Body":"Running the SSR dev server when `browser-sync` is not installed would print the error, but then build the browser and server targets, then hang and never return control to the user until they manually Ctrl+C.

The application builder didn't have this regression but I still added a test there as well to ensure we don't accidentally regress on that side in the future.\r\n\r\nSo... what happened here? Basically, `readResource` returning a string and not a Promise was triggering what I suspect was unintended behavior:\r\n\r\n1. In [`AdapterResourceLoader.preload`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/resource/src/loader.ts#L82), a string result from `readResource` leads to the function returning `undefined` instead of `Promise<undefined>`.\r\n2. In [`preloadAndParseTemplate`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/resources.ts#L403), an `undefined` return value of `preload` results in an immediate `return Promise.resolve(null)` while a `Promise.resolve(undefined)` actually populates the template cache and returns the `template` value.\r\n3. Without a `template` value, the [`ComponentDecoratorHandler.preanalyze`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/handler.ts#L374-L376) method will always return `templateStyles: []` - completely ignoring what might have actually been in the template. Which is kind of fair - it never got to see the value of `template`.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the lines, something disagrees about the meaning of `undefined` and/or if there is a semantic difference between `undefined` and `Promise<undefined>`. I'm pretty sure what we want here is the behavior of `Promise<undefined>` where it actually takes the template metadata.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28873","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): bring back style tags in browser builder\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2668276552","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T11:40:52","Actor":"mattlewis92","Number":"28885","RawContent":null,"Title":"HMR with external component styles + jit mode shows previous update on save","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen trying out the new HMR in angular 19, I found an issue when using jit mode to serve (i.e. `\"aot\": false`). HMR of styles is working, but on the first change nothing happens, and then on subsequent changes, the last change takes effect. The same issue is not present with aot mode (we are unable to use aot in our application as incremental rebuilds take ~2 minutes each time). This does not appear to affect inline component `<style>` tags and only for styles added via the `styleUrl` property.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new angular application with latest rc of angular 19\n2. Set `\"aot\": false` in the `angular.json`\n3. Change `src/app/app.component.html` to `<h1>Hello world!</h1>`\n4. Change `src/app/app.component.scss` to `h1 { color: red; }` and observe nothing happens\n5. Change `src/app/app.component.scss` to `h1 { color: blue; }` and observe the h1 tag is now `red` instead of `blue`.

Integrating Angular with Deno 2.0 would provide developers with a modern, secure, and efficient runtime for building Angular applications.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- Update the Angular CLI to support Deno 2.0 for project scaffolding, building, and serving applications.\n- Ensure that @angular/core and related packages are compatible with Deno's module system and runtime APIs.\n- Provide documentation and examples demonstrating how to develop, build, and deploy Angular applications using Deno 2.0.\n\nImplementing these changes would expand Angular's versatility and offer developers more choices in their development environments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nBefore proposing official support for Deno 2.0 in Angular, I explored the following alternatives:\n\n1. **Manual Configuration:** Attempted to manually configure Angular projects to run on Deno by adjusting build scripts and dependencies. However, this approach proved complex and error-prone, leading to maintenance challenges.\n2. **Community Plugins:** Searched for community-developed plugins or tools that facilitate Angular's integration with Deno. While some experimental solutions exist, they lack comprehensive support and are not actively maintained.\n3. **Alternative Frameworks:** Considered using other frameworks that natively support Deno. However, this would require significant refactoring of existing Angular applications and retraining of development teams.\n\nThese alternatives highlighted the need for official support to ensure a seamless and reliable integration of Angular with Deno 2.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28884","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for Deno 2.0 in Angular\" (#28884)"},{"Id":"2667618110","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T08:26:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28883","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Generated by a post-processor of CSS for what I understand. The bundled CSS in the `dist` folder references it.\n\nBesides the **increase in size of the build output**, one thing that is not working is **preloading fonts** in the `src/index.html` file. Using `href=\"assets/fonts/font.woff2\"` in a `<link rel=\"preload\">` tag will make the browser download this font, not use it, and download the version imported in the bundled CSS file in the root of `dist`.\n\n# Expected behavior\nI expected the bundled CSS to reference the font file inside the assets folder, not it to create another font in the root of the output files. Is there a configuration in `angular.json` that may prevent this behavior? Do I have to create a webpack configuration file?\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Have a font inside `src/assets/fonts/font.woff2`;\n2. Import it in a `@font-face` in the format `src: url('assets/fonts/font.woff2')` in the `src/styles.scss` file;  \n3. Build the project using `ng build` command;\n\nMy settings is closer to [@ziemerz in #6599](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6599#issuecomment-336446594) as I am also using i18n. So changing `src: url('assets/fonts/font.woff2')`  to an absolute path like `src: url('/assets/fonts/font.woff2')` will not work for me.\n\nReproduction repository:

While we can refactor our code to only rely on the `default` property, the problem becomes more difficult as it's only reproducible when disabling dependency pre-bundling (i.e. building for production), so our team are not even aware there is a problem during local development and will only find the issue after deployment, which is a bit of a footgun. Ideally behaviour during both development and in production builds would be the same.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngh repo clone mattlewis92/ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\ncd ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\nnpm i\nng serve webpack # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-with-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-no-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module only contains a `default` export\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS:

To be more specific, when the component is loaded, the ink bar is visible as the \"active\" property is \"true\". After toggling, the \"active\" property value is \"false\" and the ink bar is no longer visible. **The problem comes when the \"active\" property value toggles to \"true\" again but the ink bar is no longer visible.**\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mky45h?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftab-nav-bar-basic-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Access to the link where the property **active** of the **mat-tab-link** is toggled every 3 seconds.\n2. After waiting 3 seconds, the \"active\" property value will be \"false\" and ink bar will dissapear. That is OK.\n3. After waiting 6 seconds, the \"active\" property value will be \"true\" but the ink bar will no longer be visible again. From this point, the ink bar will never be visible again regardless of the value of the \"this.active\" attribute.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is expected that: \n1. When the active property of the **mat-tab-link** is **true**, then the ink bar should always be displayed.\n2. When the **active** property of the **mat-tab-link** is **false**, then the ink bar should never be displayed. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. When the active property of the **mat-tab-link** is **true**, then the ink bar is only displayed if the component has just been loaded. Otherwise, if the \"active\" property was previously \"false\" but it got toggled to \"true\", then the ink bar will not be visible.\n2. When the **active** property of the **mat-tab-link** is **false**, then the ink bar is never displayed. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^19.0.0-next.2\n- CDK/Material: ^19.0.0-next.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30036","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(TabNavBar): mat-tab-link gets selected only once\" (#30036)"},{"Id":"2668344635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T12:07:59","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"30034","RawContent":null,"Title":"Screen reader is not announcing the 'selected/unselected' state information for 'Favorite food' combo box in Windows.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTitle: Screen reader is not announcing the 'selected/unselected' state information for 'Favorite food' combo box in Windows.\n\nObservation:\nHere, all three Screen readers are announcing incorrect information as selected for the list items in the combo box.\n\nUser Impact:\nScreen Reader users will find difficulty in getting the required information if Screen Reader is not announcing selected state for the selected list item.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nPre-Requisite:\nTurn on Screen Readers:\nNVDA: Ctrl + Alt + N\nJAWS: Ctrl + Alt + J\nNarrator: Ctrl+ Alt + Enter\nVerbosity:\nJAWS: Beginner, Highest\nNVDA: Default\nNarrator: Default\n\nRepro steps: \n\n1.

The current example uses the &lt;table&gt; tag, but it should be using &lt;mat-table&gt; instead. This discrepancy may cause confusion for new developers who rely on the documentation for accurate guidance.\n\nProblem Details:\nOn the [Angular Material mat-table documentation page](https://v13.material.angular.io/components/table/overview), the code examples use the standard '&lt;table&gt;' tag, which does not support Angular Material's dataSource binding. New developers might encounter errors like \"Can't bind to 'dataSource' since it isn't a known property of 'table'\" if they follow the provided example as-is.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe documentation should demonstrate the proper usage of &lt;mat-table&gt; instead of &lt;table&gt;. Updating the examples to reflect the correct component will make the documentation more accurate and prevent confusion for developers.\n\nSuggestion:\nReplace instances of &lt;table&gt; with &lt;mat-table&gt; in the code examples, ensuring that all Angular Material features, like dataSource binding, are correctly showcased. This will provide developers with working examples that do not require additional troubleshooting.\n\nAdditional Context:\nMany developers are finding the correct solution only after searching online, as seen in this [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50228138/cant-bind-to-datasource-since-it-isnt-a-known-property-of-table). It would be beneficial to keep the documentation up to date with working code examples to help new developers avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://v13.material.angular.io/components/table/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30031","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Issue with Angular Material Documentation: Incorrect mat-table Example\" (#30031)"},{"Id":"2664266875","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-16T12:34:47","Actor":"Totati","Number":"30030","RawContent":null,"Title":".docs-bug: StackBlitz examples of current (18.2.13) version are generated with 19.0.0-rc.2","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nWhen  edit an example of latest stable version in stackblitz, the repo is generated with the next release candidate\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c6a3a6-e023-400d-9170-47cc3ac1a2fd)\n\nThe displayed version in the html is just static text\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4f24374-ab44-4cfa-8672-f5b60340e59b)\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nevery example link","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30030","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".docs-bug: StackBlitz examples of current (18.2.13) version are generated with 19.0.0-rc.2\" (#30030)"},{"Id":"2662577144","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T16:55:20","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"30029","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): update documentation","State":"open","Body":"update documentation to let users know about passing 3:1 non text contrast ratio for active and inactive slider tracks\r\n\r\nfixes b/286300099","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30029","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): update documentation\" (#30029)"},{"Id":"2657150389","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T15:46:42","Actor":"bugfiler","Number":"30013","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat Dialog doesn't respect default max width of 80vw","State":"closed","Body":"According to documentation (https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api#MatDialogConfig), the maxWidth of MatDialog should default to 80vw.\n\nThis is now defaulting to a max of 560px or the value of --mat-dialog-container-max-width\n\nDev tools indicates this bit of styling is setting it:\ncdk-overlay-pane.mat-mdc-dialog-panel {\n    max-width: var(--mat-dialog-container-max-width, 560px);\n    min-width: var(--mat-dialog-container-min-width, 280px);\n}\n\nYou can just set the width of any internal element to 90vw and see the scroll bar.\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/c1gort?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdialog-content-example-dialog.html\n\nThis defaulted to 80vw as of 21 August 2024  with the Google3 version.

Probably Angular 13, back in 2021, something like that.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we updated the project a couple of times of course. Currently on Angular 17 and upgraded from nguniversal to @angular/ssr.\r\n\r\nThe problem is as follows:\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to load a specific route, say a product page, products/1. And we want to set the proper Meta and SEO information. That is the reason we are using Angular SSR in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf we load, reload or SEO verify that specific route, the page source and the SEO results show the homepage information.\r\nWhen we reload the page, we can also observe, that the homepage title appears in the browser tab for a split second, before it gets replaced by the product page title.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing it turns out, if we change the homepage component to use a \"home\" route instead of an empty \" \" route, the product page information loads correctly. Furthermore, if we remove `</ion-router-outlet>` (also tested with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`), the meta information also loads corretly in the page (even though the page doesn't load of course).\r\n\r\nWe use resolvers on the homepage to fetch some data, and we have another set of resolvers for the product page.\r\n\r\nWe don't use standalone components and we don't use child modules.\r\n\r\nChanging the order of the routes, chaining resolvers, putting the Meta service inside the resolver had no effect.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aleksander351/ionic7-ssr-basic\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThere is no exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.9\r\nNode: 20.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.9\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.9\r\nrxjs                            7.5.0\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Empty path breaks routing and consequently SEO in a server side rendered Angular application\" (#57715)"},{"Id":"2512025159","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-07T21:32:35","Actor":"Nilam-Pal","Number":"57714","RawContent":null,"Title":"pipe content is not showing","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nPipe content is not visible showing 404 error\r\n pipes#built-in-pipes\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/pipes#built-in-pipes\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nAngular.dev\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nurl issue\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57714","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"pipe content is not showing\" (#57714)"},{"Id":"2512015291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-07T18:55:10","Actor":"theangular","Number":"57713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with accessing the 'subscribe' property in nested calls within Angular 2 due to it being undefined","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am trying to implement a subscription in company-list.component using the method getCompanies() from the company.service.

comes with several significant changes:\n\n### New Features (Go)\n\n-   Users can set an OS-specific Bazelisk home directory, e.g. via `BAZELISK_HOME_WINDOWS` ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/474](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/474))\n-   `BAZELISK_WRAPPER_DIRECTORY` allows users to specify paths other than the default `tools/bazel` location ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/567](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/567))\n-   `BAZELISK_HOME`: Environment variables as well as the tilde sign are now properly expanded ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/587](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/587))\n-   Bazelisk can fetch Linux ARM64 Bazel binaries built for commits ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/604](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/604))\n\n### Bug Fixes & Improvements\n\n-   The Python version properly handles empty lines in `.bazelversion` files ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/576](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/576))\n\nWe’d like to thank our amazing contributors

Console errors from users reporting this problem show module loading issues, in the following format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading failed for the module with source “https://cf.geekdo-static.com/frontend/chunk-7VTT4A6L.js”.

[boardgamegeek.com](http://boardgamegeek.com/)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe listed files are accessible, and can be loaded fine from CDN.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the site work again, users have reported that they have to go into their Firefox settings, and clear their cache for the past day. (A hard reload with Ctrl-F5 does not help). Also, going into a private window seems to help.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I've never been able to reproduce this issue myself (the site is [BoardGamegGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)) but the reports are quite consistent, if not super frequent. It may be the case that some users run into this problem more than other users, but I can't say that for sure. The fact that cache clearing solves the issue seems to suggest that something about how Firefox is caching is causing it to cache some corrupt file, with cascading consequences, but that is purely conjecture on my part. \r\n\r\nThis may be related to angular/angular#44780, which we also reported, although note that that dates back to when Angular was using Webpack. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nIt is possible that you might run into this browsing the Angular portions of https://boardgamegeek.com\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.4\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Intermittent module load errors in Firefox only\" (#28361)"},{"Id":"2511146966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T20:48:21","Actor":"tsteuwer-accesso","Number":"28365","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, we're running to a lot of \"Chunk loading errors\" when using CI/CD with Angular and Angular's SSR. The reason for this is because our CDN reaches out to origin to get static assets, which are served from SSR. As soon as a new build goes out, the CDN is cleared, and the new assets are now live.\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with people currently on the site as lazy-loaded chunks that are still wanting to be requested in the users browser will try to go back to origin, only for the CDN to find out they no longer exists because chunk file hashes changed, and trigger the \"Chunk loading errors\" we're constantly seeing.\r\n\r\nIn order for users to fix this, they must do a hard-refresh, something we do not want our users to have to go through, especially since we're an international company and at any point in time, we can have people millions of people on in any of our regions.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to configure where **browser** static assets are pulled. One solution we thought of is to be able to change the URL where browser assets are pulled from. Think of it like this:\r\n\r\n1.) Build 5000 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5000/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n2.) Build 5001 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5001/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n\r\nIf user was currently on 5000, the static assets from the `/5000` folder can still be loaded from our domain. If the user refreshes, and we had cleared our CDN, they would start getting `/5001` requests because the main html changed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, we're thinking about just doing a find and replace on any `./chunk` string in the output dist for `/browser` and doing this ourselves. I'm not sure if the Google team has ran into this, I'm sure they have, but I would also welcome any other solutions you guys come up with. The easiest though, would be to allow us to configure this somehow so that server assets always load locally, but browser assets can be changed where you serve them from.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28365","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from\" (#28365)"},{"Id":"2511045860","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T19:08:29","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28364","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: elaborate on debugging jasmine node tests","State":"open","Body":"The existing instructions don't quite cover a full debugging setup and miss some flags that allow debugging without modification of BUILD files.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

specified is a red herring.\r\nPerhaps there is a difference between the output from browser and browser-esbuild, and that whatever the SpaServices is looking for, that was written out from browser, is not being written out by browser-esbuild, so SpaServices is still waiting for something before it will proxy (or whatever) and return index.html (ie. still waiting for Angular to startup on localhost:4200)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nsee above\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/19.0.0-next.2...19.0.0-next.3)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### cdk\n\n-   -   Since `cdk.high-contrast` targets a media query instead of a class, the specificity of the styles it emits is lower than before.\n-   -   Virtual scrolling lists now have proper type checking which can reveal some previously-hidden compilation errors.\n\n    -   fix(cdk/scrolling): adds ngTemplateContextGuard\n    implements ngTemplateContextGuard for CdkVirtualForOf directive\n\n##### material\n\n-   -   `mixinColor` and `CanColor` have been removed. Use a host binding instead.\n    -   `mixinDisableRipple` and `CanDisableRipple` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinDisabled` and `CanDisable` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinInitialized` and `HasInitialized` have been removed. Use a `Subject` that emits in `ngOnInit` instead.\n    -   `mixinTabIndex` and `HasTabIndex` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n\n##### material\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [90eea1bf70](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/90eea1bf7084ea7098676ca9988624802f27884c) | fix | **core:** Allow system variables to be formatted for opacity ([#&#8203;29665](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29665)) |\n| [edce90652a](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/edce90652ade6715b4404db284f684b1b511fae4) | fix | **core:** delete deprecated APIs ([#&#8203;29651](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29651)) |\n| [4771931c2f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/4771931c2f334be1edc2b7764921d6539808317e) | fix | **core:** Fix incorrect color role mappings ([#&#8203;29655](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29655)) |\n| [9333de0537](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/9333de0537e7b905407999820bf283f4943c986b) | fix | **tooltip:** remove old IE workaround ([#&#8203;29674](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29674)) |\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [f4a02adb77](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/f4a02adb779968ab1e696aa93dc69b62e7a18929) | feat | **a11y:** use native media query for high contrast detection ([#&#8203;29678](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29678)) |\n| [5439460d1f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/5439460d1fe166f8ec34ab7d48f05e0dd7f6a946) | fix | **scrolling:** adds ngTemplateContextGuard ([#&#8203;27276](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/27276)) |\n\n##### multiple\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b3a9062edf](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/b3a9062edf8863250ddd462e5abe009fbc46243b) | fix | ripples not showing up in some cases ([#&#8203;29672](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29672)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This mode can produce a fully client-side rendered (CSR) or static site generated (SSG) site. When SSG is enabled, redirects are handled using the `<meta>` tag.\r\n- `'server'`: Produces an application designed for deployment on a server that supports server-side rendering (SSR) or a hybrid approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `outputMode` option determines whether the new API is used. If enabled, it bundles the `server.ts` as a separate entry point, preventing it from directly referencing `main.server.ts` and excluding it from localization.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it is also being considered that this option will replace `appShell` and `prerendering` when server routing configuration is present.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28355","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): introduce `outputMode` option to the application builder\" (#28355)"},{"Id":"2506977470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T08:44:43","Actor":"zmara","Number":"28354","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing rebuild logs","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nDuring (serve) rebuild on save there used to be a log about information that the rebuild started, now there is none - only \"Compiled successfully\" when rebuild is done.\r\n\r\nWhy is that a problem? In large codebases the rebuild can take more time and it is important for a developer to see that he saved a file and the rebuild is happening so he needs to wait a moment in order to see changes he made. When there is no log, he will start questioning himself why the changes he made are not there. It is very important and informative log.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nLatest version of create-nx-workspace with Angular app\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nwebpack                         5.90.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nUsing @nx/angular: 19.6.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28354","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing rebuild logs\" (#28354)"},{"Id":"2506941176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T07:01:00","Actor":"BBboy01","Number":"28352","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): support custom postcss config","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

`meta.feature-exists` function is now deprecated. This deprecation is\n    named `feature-exists`.\n\n-   Fix a crash when using `@at-root` without any queries or children in the\n    indented syntax.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Backport the deprecation options (`fatalDeprecations`, `futureDeprecations`,\n    and `silenceDeprecations`) to the legacy JS API. The legacy JS API is itself\n    deprecated, and you should move off of it if possible, but this will allow\n    users of bundlers and other tools that are still using the legacy API to\n    still control deprecation warnings.\n\n-   Fix a bug where accessing `SourceSpan.url` would crash when a relative URL was\n    passed to the Sass API.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Explicitly expose a `sass` executable from the `sass-embedded` npm package.\n    This was intended to be included in 1.63.0, but due to the way\n    platform-specific dependency executables are installed it did not work as\n    intended. Now users can run `npx sass` for local installs or just `sass` when\n    `sass-embedded` is installed globally.\n\n-   Add linux-riscv64, linux-musl-riscv64, and android-riscv64 support for the\n    `sass-embedded` npm package.\n\n-   Fix an edge case where the Dart VM could hang when shutting down when requests\n    were in flight.\n\n-   Fix a race condition where the embedded host could fail to shut down if it was\n    closed around the same time a new compilation was started.\n\n-   Fix a bug where parse-time deprecation warnings could not be controlled by\n    the deprecation options in some circumstances.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n###

This configuration can lead to incorrect content being served, particularly in scenarios involving lazy-loaded modules or Angular routes with dots in their paths.\r\n\r\n### Current Problem:\r\n**1. Static File and SSR Route Handling:**\r\n\r\n* The server uses server.get('**', express.static(...)) and server.get('**', ...) for static files and SSR routes, respectively. This configuration causes every request to go through the static file middleware, including those intended for Angular SSR.\r\n* As a result, some routes can inadvertently serve the `index.html` file or other static assets, leading to incorrect `Content-Type` headers, especially for JavaScript files (e.g., lazy-loaded modules; the `main*.js` and `chunk*.js` files).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0f9744-2440-4f9f-986e-4e3f4b9afa6f)\r\n(I cant show the response, but it's the `index.html` content)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076e746-28cb-489f-ad5e-5e55291668ce)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Lack of Distinction Between Static Files and Angular Routes:**\r\n\r\nRequests that are intended to be handled by Angular’s SSR engine may be incorrectly intercepted by the static file middleware if the requested path contains dots or other file-like patterns.

SSR Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\n* Static assets should be served with correct Content-Type headers.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badccd98-83a0-4b3d-a26f-3223472ee1b8)\r\n\r\n* Angular routes should be correctly handled by SSR, regardless of whether they contain dots or other special characters.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n> Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

Open the autocomplete and select 'One'\r\n2. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65d9ab91-0695-4be0-af55-1eae5eb65060)\r\n3. Delete out the 'n' & the 'e' to be left with a filter of 'O'; note that the 'myControl.value' is still `One` (due to having set `requireSelection`)\r\n4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c45088e-c38b-401a-ad4e-8d731fa00b20)\r\n5. Delete out the final 'O' from your filter; note that 'myControl.value' is again still `One`\r\n6. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\r\n7. In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2505485383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T14:08:36","Actor":"GiftLanga","Number":"29690","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …","State":"open","Body":"…input\r\n\r\nAdds the `updateNativeInput` field to the autocomplete trigger to update the native input element when the autocomplete is within a form field.\r\n\r\nFixes #29388.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …\" (#29690)"},{"Id":"2504966843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T10:42:16","Actor":"MaiGhoneim","Number":"29689","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n8.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nwhen enabling drag and drop in angular material table from columns headers for reoreder columns, cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" do not working in angular 18 \r\ni attached my code in the following link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. trying to drag any column header\r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nwhen dragging column header should be drag and drop only horizontail and in x direction\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ncolumn header drag and drop to everywhere\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table\" (#29689)"},{"Id":"2504621459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T08:14:12","Actor":"iFederx","Number":"29687","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): mat tab content not visible if tab is switched during animation of parent div","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you have a div animated that contains a mat-tab-group and you change tab during parent div's animation, the tab content will be invisible.\r\nLast version tested: angular 16.2.1.

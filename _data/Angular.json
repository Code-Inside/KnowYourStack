When the project is built in production mode, some animations are missing.\n**How to reproduce:**\nClone and run in different configurations https://github.com/igokul1973/blog.didgibot.com/commit/e478057a6c234c81b2337694984e2f9354babc25. You will see the header animation in both cases but in production mode the subheader line 'blog about making the blog' will be hidden because the animation responsible for changing opacity to 1 is missing.\n**What I tried:**\nChanging optimization to 'false' in production mode helps, changing to `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None` works too, but both are suboptimal and should not be used.\n**Similar issues:**\nI read the closed issue - https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53038 - and it is very similar as far as the issue description is concerned. In my case, however, while experimenting I even moved all @keyframes styling to the same component stylesheet (which is recommended on the issue 53038 but in my case adds to redundancy and is also suboptimal), but it did not help.\nAnother similar issue - https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60878.\n**Environment:**\nI use Angular 19, Angular Material 19, etc. Please let me know if you have any questions.\nFor now I will resort to setting encapsulation to None.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/igokul1973/blog.didgibot.com/commit/e478057a6c234c81b2337694984e2f9354babc25\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo errors\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 22.4.1\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.10\n@angular/cdk                    19.2.14\n@angular/cli                    19.2.10\n@angular/material               19.2.14\n@schematics/angular             19.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n<img width=\"1683\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4595af61-b6f2-4c30-b4d6-c61084ba59d2\" />\n<img width=\"1683\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18a8c146-bdb2-4a29-8e9b-0b7a5ca54042\" />","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61150","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"animations missing in production\" (#61150)"},{"Id":"3043650996","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T18:28:06","Actor":"roma2341","Number":"61148","RawContent":null,"Title":"R3InjectorError unclear message if \"aot\" is false","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhat does it means ?

An extended diagnostic ([NG8109](https://angular.dev/extended-diagnostics/NG8109)) exists to report these if used in template interpolations, but not for control flow. \n\nI just reviewed some code that contained a decently hard to spot bug related to an `@if` condition never being met, as it was apparently negating a `signal` without invoking it. \n\nThe code looked similar to this:\n\n```html\n<!-- app.component.html -->\n\n<!-- This is wrong, since isArchived is a signal. Hard to spot! -->\n@if (!isArchived) {\n  <div>Some template</div>\n}\n```\n\n```ts\n// app.component.ts\n\nclass SomeComponent {\n  public isArchived = signal(false);\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the template inside the `@if`-block would never be shown, even if the `isArchived` signal would have a value of `true`, since signals themselves are always truthy.\n\n---\n\nThis seems to only be an issue for **negated** signals in `@if` or `@else-if`, as all other control flow elements have other diagnostics reported that would prevent compilation.\n\nGiven the following component:\n```ts\nimport { Component, signal, input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  public show = signal(false);\n\n  public otherBoolean = signal(false);\n\n  public userPermissions = signal<'admin' | 'reviewer' | 'editor'>('admin');\n\n  public arrayLike = input<string[]>([]);\n}\n```\n\nUninvoked signals in all blocks are reported by existing compiler errors (specifically, `NG4` and `NG8`). Only the negated uninvoked signal is not reported. \n\n<img width=\"1205\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f74d9f4-55ab-452a-b2cf-f6148ea191fb\" />\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt would be nice to have reporting on either specifically _negated, uninvoked signals_, or any uninvoked signals in control flow syntax.\n\nI can think of the following options:\n\n**Extend NG8109 to report uninvoked signals in control flow**\nIt's a similar issue, since uninvoked signals are most likely developer errors that can lead to bugs. Unsure how this affects existing configurations, as this can lead to new errors being reported / suppressed. \n\n**Create a new extended diagnostic**\nThis would report on uninvoked signals in control flow syntax, as outlined in the description.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- The existing [NG8109](https://angular.dev/extended-diagnostics/NG8109) diagnostic - This doesn't report for uninvoked signals in control flow syntax.\n- Custom ESLint rule - Hard to implement, requires type information and parsing the control flow syntax.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61141","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enforce signal invocation in control flow syntax\" (#61141)"},{"Id":"3042041323","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T16:12:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"61137","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): missing useExisting providers throwing for optional calls","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the runtime was throwing a DI error when attempting to inject a missing `useExisting` provider, despite the call being optional.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that when the provider has `useExisting`, we do a second `inject` call under the hood which didn't include the inject flags from the original call.\r\n\r\nFixes #61121.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61137","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): missing useExisting providers throwing for optional calls\" (#61137)"},{"Id":"3042571816","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T16:11:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"61138","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add interop pnpm and aspect files to fileFilters","State":"closed","Body":"This change will force these files to be committed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61138","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: add interop pnpm and aspect files to fileFilters\" (#61138)"},{"Id":"3041544913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T16:10:02","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61134","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.28.17","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.28.16` -> `v3.28.17` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.28.17`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.28.17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.28.16...v3.28.17)\n\n### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n#### 3.28.17 - 02 May 2025\n\n-   Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.21.2.

Clone and start the application\n2. Take an initial memory heap snapshot.\n3. Create and destroy a dynamic component, e.g, 5 times.\n4. Take another memory heap snapshot.\n5. Compare Snapshot 1 and Snapshot 2: Delta for EventListener (and some others) is +20.\n\nIt doesn't matter what content/template has the dynamic component, the issue persists anyway. If the 'click' callback performs anything different from dynamic component creation, everything looks good, and nothing is leaking.\n\nIt also doesn't matter if the application is Zone/Zone-Less, or if Signal-Based/Decorator-based API is used.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/DMezhenskyi/angular-dynamic-components/tree/EventListener-memory-leak-reproduction\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo errors or exceptions\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.7\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.7\n@angular/build               19.2.7\n@angular/cli                 19.2.7\n@schematics/angular          19.2.7\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.5.4\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n<img width=\"927\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a2b700-c245-427f-be4e-cabaf2b51f14\" />","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61135","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Memory leak when component is created dynamically\" (#61135)"},{"Id":"3041542463","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T05:15:45","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61133","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update babel dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/cli](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-cli) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-cli)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.27.0` -> `7.27.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcli/7.27.0/7.27.2) |\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.26.10` -> `7.27.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.26.10/7.27.1) |\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.27.0` -> `7.27.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.27.0/7.27.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/cli)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.27.2`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7272-2025-05-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.27.1...v7.27.2)\n\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n-   `babel-parser`\n    -

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.3...v0.25.4)\n\n-   Add simple support for CORS to esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;4125](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4125))\n\n    Starting with version 0.25.0, esbuild's development server is no longer configured to serve cross-origin requests. This was a deliberate change to prevent any website you visit from accessing your running esbuild development server. However, this change prevented (by design) certain use cases such as \"debugging in production\" by having your production website load code from `localhost` where the esbuild development server is running.\n\n    To enable this use case, esbuild is adding a feature to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (a.k.a. CORS) for [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests). Specifically, passing your origin to the new `cors` option will now set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header when the request has a matching `Origin` header. Note that this currently only works for requests that don't send a preflight `OPTIONS` request, as esbuild's development server doesn't currently support `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n    Some examples:\n\n    -   **CLI:**\n\n            esbuild --servedir=. --cors-origin=https://example.com\n\n    -   **JS:**\n\n        ```js\n        const ctx = await esbuild.context({})\n        await ctx.serve({\n          servedir: '.',\n          cors: {\n            origin: 'https://example.com',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   **Go:**\n\n        ```go\n        ctx, _ := api.Context(api.BuildOptions{})\n        ctx.Serve(api.ServeOptions{\n          Servedir: \".\",\n          CORS: api.CORSOptions{\n            Origin: []string{\"https://example.com\"},\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    The special origin `*` can be used to allow any origin to access esbuild's development server. Note that this means any website you visit will be able to read everything served by esbuild.\n\n-   Pass through invalid URLs in source maps unmodified ([#&#8203;4169](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4169))\n\n    This fixes a regression in version 0.25.0 where `sources` in source maps that form invalid URLs were not being passed through to the output. Version 0.25.0 changed the interpretation of `sources` from file paths to URLs, which means that URL parsing can now fail. Previously URLs that couldn't be parsed were replaced with the empty string. With this release, invalid URLs in `sources` should now be passed through unmodified.\n\n-   Handle exports named `__proto__` in ES modules ([#&#8203;4162](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4162), [#&#8203;4163](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4163))\n\n    In JavaScript, the special property name `__proto__` sets the prototype when used inside an object literal. Previously esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS conversion didn't special-case the property name of exports named `__proto__` so the exported getter accidentally became the prototype of the object literal. It's unclear what this affects, if anything, but it's better practice to avoid this by using a computed property name in this case.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n###

This is not my concern.\nMy concern is how you need to override css in order to achieve the **styling** for this pattern.\n\n### Use Case\n\nMy goal is to avoid custom selector overrides, digging into pseudo elements etc. as it make the project susceptible to any internal naming changes etc.\n\nBelow is the minimal fix that I am using currently (maybe there's a better solution, IDK)\n\n```css\nbutton.mat-mdc-menu-trigger[aria-expanded=\"true\"] {\n  .mat-mdc-button-persistent-ripple.mdc-icon-button__ripple:before {\n    opacity: var(--mat-icon-button-pressed-state-layer-opacity);\n  }\n} \n```\n\nThis is basically overriding material's identical selector:\n\n```\nopacity: var(--mat-icon-button-hover-state-layer-opacity, var(--mat-sys-hover-state-layer-opacity))\n```\n\nand even if you choose to make your own directive that injects MatMenuTrigger on host, listens to the events and appends a custom class, you'd still have to define this custom class more or less like in the example. And I see this css override too internal and problematic. Therefore I would love it if material could come to the rescue and do what it can natively, such as - maybe - add an input `[pressedWhileOpen]=\"true\"`\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31014","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MENU): Native material way to maintain MatMenuTrigger pressed state\" (#31014)"},{"Id":"3036282355","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T15:23:38","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"31013","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/testing): cleanup apis for landing on adev","State":"open","Body":"Demo:\r\n[api index](https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60853-adev-prev-qbx2pg5n.web.app/api)\r\n[cdk/testing](https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60853-adev-prev-qbx2pg5n.web.app/api/cdk/testing/AsyncOptionPredicate)\r\n[cdk/testing/testbed](https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60853-adev-prev-qbx2pg5n.web.app/api/cdk/testing/testbed/TestbedHarnessEnvironment)\r\n[cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver](https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60853-adev-prev-qbx2pg5n.web.app/api/cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver/SeleniumWebDriverElement)\r\n[cdk/testing/protractor](https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60853-adev-prev-qbx2pg5n.web.app/api/cdk/testing/protractor/ProtractorElement)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31013","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(cdk/testing): cleanup apis for landing on adev\" (#31013)"},{"Id":"3035692464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T12:17:21","Actor":"moniuch","Number":"31012","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(TABS): Better support for faceless mat-tabs usage","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nI'd like to ask for a better `MatTabGroup` support for using the component in a faceless manner\n\n1. add a faceless mode so that the `mat-tab-header` is not rendered - without need to hiding it via css `::ng-deep` - this always feels a wrong thing to do - exposing oneself to any changes being breaking)\n\n2. add `focusTabById(id: string)` method to enable navigation by `MatTab` `id` - since the docs rightfully put the responsibility on the consumer to make sure ids are unique, this very same responsibility would also be extended here, to make sure that this method would pick the right, unique tab.\n\n3. expose the collection of tab ids so that consumer can grab a `viewChild` reference and iterate the collection and associate it with index. This could be an alternative to adding the method (2)\n\n### Use Case\n\nI need to use MatTabs in a faceless mode, meaning - tab header not rendered. The reason is I want to  leverage the lazy loading of `mat-tab-content`, and I need to control the tabs programmatically from a custom component. What makes it hard is that the only method currently available is via index - an id-based activation would be more reliable a logical extension of allowing custom ids. If not by introducing a new method (described in 2) then at least via exposing the collection of ids (described in 3)\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31012","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(TABS): Better support for faceless mat-tabs usage\" (#31012)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-05-07T03:30:02.2179455Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1429}

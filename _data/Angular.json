-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is probably caused by package @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 9 (9.1.12)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn angular 9 if using router navigation like:\r\n  this.router.navigate([\"parent\", { outlets: { primary: \"child\" } }], {});\r\n\r\nIt will produce the following url: /parent/(child)\r\nbut in angular 10 this url will instead be: /parent/child\r\n\r\nThey will though have the same currentUrlTree structure in the angular router in both angular 9 and 10 if the navigation was made with the angular router.\r\n\r\nBut if the browser is reloaded or the url (with /parent/child) are pasted into another browser window the internal UrlTree of the angular router will have a different structure.\r\n\r\nSo in angular 10 the urlTree has one structure if using:   this.router.navigate([\"parent\", { outlets: { primary: \"child\" } }], {});\r\nbut if reloading the browser from that specific url the initial created url tree will have a different structure. See the provided stackblitz console for more details.\r\n\r\nBefore reload:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7062803/97011103-8ea4ef80-1546-11eb-9a1c-4d46a48d1b78.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7062803/97011166-9f556580-1546-11eb-9a5f-928f004ee805.png)\r\n\r\nThis issue then in its turn blocks the possibility to activate a named outlet for the router.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nExample with Angular 9: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-sdc5rh?file=src/app/parent/parent.component.ts\r\nExample with Angular 10: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-jqkm4x?file=src/app/parent/parent.component.ts\r\n\r\nCheck the different behavior between angular 9 and 10 by pressing:\r\n1. Show parent\r\n2. Show child by router navigate\r\n3. Reload window\r\n4. Show child-named-outlet\r\n\r\nStep 4 only works in angular 9\r\n\r\nPress the \"Show Parent\" to \"reset the application\" and test other combinations if needed.\r\nAlso check the console that logs the different UrlTree structures\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39401","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 10 changes router outlet url so site cannot be reloaded in browser\" (#39401)"},{"Id":"728219326","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-23T13:28:39","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"39400","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Learning Angular book edition","State":"open","Body":"Update the resource Learning Angular book into the third edition\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I have a use case where we're being provided a externally build `FormControl`, which we'd like to treat as readonly effectively and would like to register for disabled handling but we'd want to clean it up once our own code goes out of scope (by which I mean someone externally calls `destroy` on our object).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nLooking at current implementation of FormControl, we'd just need to add `deregisterOnChange` and `deregisterOnDisabledChange` methods to the public API which allows the programmer to pass in the same function ref as one passed in during registration and internally the FormControl would do something like a `this._onChange = this._onChange.filter(fn => fn !== handler)` (where `handler` is an argument to the method). Same idea as `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`.\r\n\r\nIf this solution is viable, I can try to get it working and submit a PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n1. Current work around we've got involves casting to `any` and performing this removal ourselves.\r\n2. We could listen to `formControl.statusChanges` but I don't believe there is a `ENABLED` event but there is a `DISABLED` event? And I don't know what 'VALID' mean in this context? If there is a validation error but we do `enable()` what emits? `VALID`? `INVALID`? In my opinion this is confusing and hence in the application code I've decided to use `registerOnDiabledChange` instead of relying on `statusChanges` for keeping track of disabled changes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Methods on FormControl to allow de-registration of change and disabled handlers\" (#39390)"},{"Id":"727523345","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T16:03:56","Actor":"devpato","Number":"39389","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(features): traduccion de features.html","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.35`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7035)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.34...7.0.35)\n\n-   Add migration guide link to PostCSS 8 error text.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This means the reported progress is not very helpful or useful. Ideally, this should reflect the entirety of the `ng build` process to give more accurate measurement.\r\n\r\nUsers tend to think of percentage progress as representing time the process with take. Since it is very hard to know how long a given build step will take (for example, `tsc` and Terser tend to take the longest, while index file generation is pretty quick), it may make more sense to report steps rather than percentage. The CLI could print \"Executing step 4/9 - Compiling TypeScript\" to be more clear that 44% of build time has not passed, but rather we're running the 4th of 9 build steps, each of which could take an unspecified and non-equivalent length of time. We should also include a spinner just to show that work is being done, since individual build steps may take a long time and we don't want the user to think the CLI is frozen when it is not.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would have such progress reporting in all non-trivial CLI commands, but for now, we'll limit this issue to just `ng build` and `ng serve`, which is where users will be spending 99% of their time anyways.\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [X] build\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19181","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"More accurate progress reporting in `ng build`\" (#19181)"},{"Id":"727524345","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T19:24:00","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"19179","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add husky ignored files to .gitignore","State":"closed","Body":"Ahead of upgrading to husky v5, adding the shell file location\r\nto .gitignore to prevent it from randomly showing up when devs\r\ncheckout older branches.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19179","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add husky ignored files to .gitignore\" (#19179)"},{"Id":"727496302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T19:17:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"19178","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-webpack): fully close Webpack 5 compiler","State":"closed","Body":"The Webpack 5 compiler now contains a close function that should be called when the compiler is finished.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19178","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-webpack): fully close Webpack 5 compiler\" (#19178)"},{"Id":"727436798","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T14:51:13","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"19177","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): Schematic to migrate invalid interpolations","State":"closed","Body":"This commit adds a migration schematic to fix interpolation-like markup\r\nnow invalidated by #39107.

The current APIs are a bit too complex; this can have a negative impact on `TestHarness` adoption.\r\n\r\n# For test authors\r\n\r\n## 1. Easier access to harness\r\n\r\n`HarnessLoader` is a nice abstraction but it can make harness instantiation cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\nlet loader: HarnessLoader;\r\nlet rootLoader: HarnessLoader;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n  loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\r\n  rootLoader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixture(fixture, MyDialogButtonHarness);\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have faster harness access like:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.A\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even global functions like `getHarness` and `getProtractorHarness` functions could make the tests even more readable:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.B\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n  const buttonHarness = await getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# For harness authors\r\n\r\n## 2. `LocatorFactory` abstraction\r\n\r\nThe `LocatorFactory` approach _(e.g. `locatorFor()` method returns a function that takes no parameters)_ can be confusing and cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  protected getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.getTriggerElement();\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 2.A\r\n\r\nSimple accessor methods like `get()` or `getOptional()` seem easier to use and more intuitive.\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.get('button');\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can let developers factorize the way they want:\r\n```ts\r\ngetTriggerElement() {\r\n  return this.get('button');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. `async / await` vs chaining\r\n\r\nI am personally not a big fan of chaining (a.k.a. builder pattern) but in cases like this one where we end up with lots of `await`s, this can simplify the interface:\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  const el = await this.getMessageElement();\r\n  const text = await el.text();\r\n  return text === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 3.A\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  return (await this.getMessageElement().text()) === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Trigger any event\r\n\r\n`TestElement` should have a `triggerEvent` function that allows harness authors to trigger any event. \r\n\r\n### Suggestion 4.A\r\n```ts\r\nel.triggerEvent('dragenter', {})\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Common\r\n\r\n## 5. Provide synchronous functions\r\n\r\nSome environments can query the DOM synchronously (e.g. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`) or through some under the hood chaining (e.g. Cypress) (Cf. https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Chains-of-Commands).\r\nHarness authors might want to focus on these environments. In that case, they will want to use synchronous functions and keep tests and harnesses easier to read & write.\r\n\r\n### Current approach\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItems = this.locatorForAll('li');\r\n\r\n  async getItemNames() {\r\n    const items = await this.getItems();\r\n    const itemNames = await Promise.all(items.map(item => item.text()));\r\n    return itemNames;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = await loader.getHarness(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(await itemListHarness.getItemNames()).toEqual(['üçî', 'üçü']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 5.A\r\n\r\nProviding synchronous alternatives to accessors.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItemNamesSync() {\r\n    return this.getAllSync('li').map(item => item.textSync());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = loader.getHarnessSync(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(itemListHarness.getItemNamesSync()).toEqual(['üçî', 'üçü']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment ` vs. `TestBedHarnessEnvironment `\r\n\r\n`TestbedHarnessEnvironment` could be renamed to `TestBedHarnessEnvironment` to stay consistent with `TestBed` üòâ\r\n\r\n## 7. Merge `TestBed` and `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`\r\n\r\nIn some future, wouldn't it be nice to merge `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` with `TestBed` which means moving test harness to the angular repo?\r\n\r\n## 8. Cypress support\r\n\r\nAn external library could provide a `CypressHarnessEnvironment` but as presented in the 5th item, Cypress is based on an abstract chain of commands. `TestElement` doesn't seem to be the right abstraction for this use case especially for getters like `text()`, `getProperty()` etc...\r\n\r\nThis is the last item on the list but probably the most important one. One of the key features of harnesses is the test environment abstraction and harness reuse through environments (TestBed, Protractor etc...) but if I am using TestBed and Cypress and if I can't reuse my harnesses with Cypress then it somewhat defeats the purpose of harnesses. \r\n\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(@angular/cdk/testing): Component Harness Feedback\" (#20871)"},{"Id":"728306226","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-23T15:19:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20870","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): some screen readers announcing long decimal values","State":"open","Body":"Note: this is a resubmit of #20721 which renames the `aria-valuetext` input to `valueText` based on the note in #20849.\r\n\r\nIt looks like some screen readers announce the value of a slider by calculating the percentage themselves using the `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` and `aria-valuenow`.

In many cases, we want to leave the origin unchanged, but if there are cases that need the origin to be updated, allow for this with an optional origin param.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nIf the focus origin value is keyboard, and some interaction happens where we want to set focus to another element somewhere on the page by explicitly calling focus(), then in cases where the focus origin should remain the same, the current implementation causes the origin to change and the interaction to be weird.

Some of them are optional but the input `config` is required to use the component. Therefore I defined a component selector that has an element part and an attribute part (e.g. `app-my-component[config]`). Now I always need to pass a config into the component if I want to use it. Great! I started the app with `ng serve` and everything works fine. So far so good...\r\n\r\nWhile writing the component tests I'm coming in trouble. I set the config in the `beforeEach` block where the component fixture is also created. However the required input attribute `config` is always an empty string when I called `fixture.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\nHere is the Test-File of the [minimal Reproduction](https://github.com/riede/component-with-element-and-attribute-selector) I wrote that shows exactly the behaviour.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndescribe('TestComponent', () => {\r\n  let component: TestComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<TestComponent>;\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(async(() => {\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ TestComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n    .compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(TestComponent);\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    component.requiredInput = { anyKey: 'anyValue'};\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should create', () => {\r\n    expect(component).toBeTruthy();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should not fail', () => {\r\n    const expectedResult: RequiredInput = { anyKey: 'anyValue' };\r\n    expect(component.requiredInput).toEqual(expectedResult); // <-- this expectation fails\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving the attribute part of the selector solves the problem.

This work enabled a more\r\nincremental flow for template type-checking, but unintentionally introduced\r\nseveral regressions in performance, caused by poor incrementality during\r\n`ts.Program` creation.\r\n\r\n1. The `TypeCheckProgramHost` was made to rely on the `ts.CompilerHost` to\r\n   retrieve instances of `ts.SourceFile`s from the original program. If the\r\n   host does not return the original instance of such files, but instead\r\n   creates new instances, this has two negative effects: it incurs\r\n   additional parsing time, and it interferes with TypeScript's ability to\r\n   reuse information about such files.\r\n\r\n2. During the incremental creation of a `ts.Program`, TypeScript compares\r\n   the `referencedFiles` of `ts.SourceFile` instances from the old program\r\n   with those in the new program. If these arrays differ, TypeScript cannot\r\n   fully reuse the old program. The implementation of reference tagging\r\n   introduced in 4213e8d5 restores the original `referencedFiles` array\r\n   after a `ts.Program` is created, which means that future incremental\r\n   operations involving that program will always fail this comparison,\r\n   effectively limiting the incrementality TypeScript can achieve.\r\n\r\nProblem 1 exacerbates problem 2: if a new `ts.SourceFile` is created by the\r\nhost after shim generation has been disabled, it will have an untagged\r\n`referencedFiles` array even if the original file's `referencedFiles` was\r\nnot restored, triggering problem 2 when creating the template type-checking\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nTo fix these issues, `referencedFiles` arrays are no longer cleaned up.\r\nThis is safe to do (it's how View Engine worked) but it now requires\r\n`referencedFiles` to be temporarily cleaned during emit, so as not to\r\nproduce triple-slash references directives in .d.ts files (this temporary\r\ncleanup is also something that View Engine did).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `TypeCheckProgramHost` now uses the original `ts.Program`\r\nto retrieve original instances of `ts.SourceFile`s where possible,\r\npreventing issues when a host would otherwise return fresh instances.\r\n\r\nTogether, these fixes ensure that program reuse is as incremental as\r\npossible, and tests have been added to verify this for certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nAn optimization was further added to prevent the creation of a type-checking\r\n`ts.Program` in the first place if no type-checking is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the `NgTscPlugin`, there is no current API hook that notifies\r\nthe plugin of the impending emit operation. Instead, shims are removed\r\nduring the emit operation, by a transformer that the plugin inserts. In the\r\nfuture an API hook can be introduced which tsc_wrapped calls prior to emit,\r\nallowing for a cleaner integration.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37641","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(compiler-cli): fix regression in type-checking program reuse\" (#37641)"},{"Id":"641508086","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T23:05:49","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"37639","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(ngcc): shortcircuit tokenizing in ESM dependency host","State":"closed","Body":"This dependency host tokenizes files to identify all the imported\r\npaths.

To enable CSP, configure your web server to return an appropriate Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. Read more about content security policy at [An Introduction to Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) on the HTML5Rocks website.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nWe should clearly state some of the known limitations and configurations for using Angular with a CSP.\r\n\r\nHere are some related, known issues that have been around for 1-4 years now\r\n- [Inline <style> elements violate style-src Content Security Policy](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6361)\r\n- [[innerHTML] triggers CSP alert/report](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25214)\r\n- [Empty style tag generated when one or more components don't have styles](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31191)\r\n- [feat: add a customizable nonce attribute for injected style elements](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26152)\r\n\r\n## Suggested Steps\r\n\r\n1. We should clearly state that allowing `'unsafe-inline'` in `style-src` is required for Angular applications.\r\n1. We should clearly state that `'self'` is required for `style-src` and `script-src` in Angular applications.\r\n1. We should recommend `upgrade-insecure-requests`.\r\n1.

The big trouble for anyone trying to use Angular and GraphQL is that there is no way of pre-compile GraphQL documents. This way we end up with an extremely oversized bundles and increased script initialization.\r\n\r\nThere are solutions out there that compile GraphQL document into an AST:\r\n- [`graphql-tag/loader`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#webpack-loading-and-preprocessing)\r\n- [`babel-plugin-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`ts-transform-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/firede/ts-transform-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`rollup-plugin-graphql`](https://github.com/Kocal/rollup-plugin-graphql)\r\n\r\nNone of the solutions listed above can be used effectively if we intend to develop library containing GraphQL.\r\nWith application alone we could theoretically make it work with `graphql-tag/loader`. Adding library into the mix will simply not work, as `ng-packagr` is completely closed to any custom Rollup loaders.\r\n\r\nSimilar `ng-packagr` issue: https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1619\r\n\r\nDisclamer: I know the main issue is in `ng-packagr`, but I wanted to see what is the overall Angular CLI take on this, since Angular CLI is \"blocked\" by it indirectly.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIf the GraphQL is big enough in Angular it could become first class citizen.\r\nIf not (probably not), we would need some convenient way of adding loaders for both applications **and** libraries, as covering applications alone is only half of the story.\r\n\r\nI know `ng-packagr` is a complete separate project, but that is exactly the problem here. While Angular CLI is getting more open with public APIs, `ng-packagr` is as closed as ever.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe only alternative I can think of is a fork of `ng-packagr` and a custom Angular CLI packagr builder to handle this not so special case. Either that or a complete abandonment of Angular CLI.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17963","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"GraphQL support\" (#17963)"},{"Id":"641659131","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-19T07:35:05","Actor":"SethiPandi","Number":"17965","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make ng-serve Also Serve 3rdpartylicenses.txt","State":"closed","Body":"# üöÄ Feature request\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently `ng build` can generate the `3rdpartylicenses.txt`, which is great, but `ng serve` isn't able to serve the `3rdpartylicenses.txt`.

So what's happening is that the five or so <script/> tags are injecting on the first line of the file, but because that's an illegal region for html content here, the twig rendering is breaking (it has to happen between {%content%} block tags in the doc). I'm sure I can write an auxiliary task or something to find and move that snippet or just import my angular \"index\" file as a partial into a parent template.

Under the hood we use Mitt, but we extend Mitt with additional functionality to match most of the methods that Node‚Äôs EventEmitter provides. The following methods have been removed from Puppeteer classes that extend EventEmitter: \n\n-   `eventNames()`\n-   `getMaxListeners()`\n-   `listeners(eventName)`\n-   `prependListener`\n-   `prependOnceListener`\n-   `setMaxListeners(n)`\n-   `rawListeners(eventName)`\n\nAdditionally all the static methods on the EventEmitter class are not supported:\n\n-   `listenerCount(emitter, eventName)`\n-   `defaultMaxListeners`\n-   `errorMonitor`\n\nNode‚Äôs EventEmitter emitted a `newListener` event when a listener was added and a `removeListener` event when one was removed. These are not supported and will not be emitted.\n\n#### New features and improvements\n\n-   Send/receive debug logs are now split out into separate channels making the logs much clearer ([#&#8203;6017](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6017))\n-   You can now call `isJavaScriptEnabled()` on a Puppeteer `page` to find out if JS is enabled on the page ([#&#8203;5993](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5993)) \n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n-   Puppeteer is now much better at killing lingering browser processes, especially when you exit a test run with `Ctrl-C` ([#&#8203;6011](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6011))\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   We've started work on a new documentation system that uses TSDoc to generate documentation from our source code and have been porting documentation into code accordingly.\n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`5493494`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5493494) -

We're sorry for causing unexpected issues in the 3.2.0 release. If you were unable to upgrade from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0, you will be able to upgrade straight to 3.3.0 and not have any issues.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The Puppeteer `Response` class was renamed `HTTPResponse` to avoid a clash with the TS `Response` type. We don't expose this class on the main Puppeteer instance so this shouldn't affect any of your code.\n-   Similarly we have renamed `Worker` to `WebWorker` to avoid a clash with the TS `Worker` type. \n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`34c0f9b`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/34c0f9b) - chore: mark version v3.3.0\n[`309d811`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/309d811) - chore: Revert Mitt due to breaking changes ([#&#8203;5952](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5952))\n[`81e3248`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/81e3248) - chore: Defer Windows FF tests for longer ([#&#8203;5954](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5954))\n[`b874cac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b874cac) - chore: rename Worker to WebWorker ([#&#8203;5941](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5941))\n[`7862484`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/7862484) - chore: update request and response references in docs ([#&#8203;5942](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5942))\n[`232def0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/232def0) - chore: rename `Response` to `HTTPResponse` ([#&#8203;5940](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5940))\n[`cfd72ac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/cfd72ac) - chore: bump version to v3.2.0-post ([#&#8203;5938](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5938))\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/v3.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\n-   We now support emulating vision deficiency types within Puppeteer using `page.emulateVisionDeficiency`. You can read more about these [on the DevTools update blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/03/devtools#vision-deficiencies).\n\n-   We now use [Mitt](https://togithub.com/developit/mitt/) as the Event Emitter that backs many of Puppeteer's classes rather than the EventEmitter module that ships with Node. This **is potentially a breaking change if you rely on some of the less popular EventEmitter methods** as Puppeteer's [EventEmitter](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/src/EventEmitter.ts) does not support the entire suite of NodeJS EventEmitter functions. We think it's unlikely anyone has relied on these; we were able to swap out the EventEmitter in Puppeteer without any unit tests needing to change.\n\n-   Puppeteer now recognises webviews as regular pages which means you can control them just like you would control a regular page.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The `Request` class has been renamed to `HTTPRequest` to avoid a clash with TypeScript's `Request` type. We'll be making similar changes to `Response` and `Worker`. This is not a breaking change as Puppeteer doesn't directly expose these classes so you shouldn't be referring to them by name in your code.\n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`1d4d25a`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1d4d25a) -

This functionality is _so_ highly experimental it‚Äôs not even documented in the API docs ‚Äî on purpose! See [this comment](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405#issuecomment-621794572) for instructions on how to try it out. We are hoping to gather feedback on whether this API is useful for you, and how we could improve it. Please [let us know what you think](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405)!\n\n### Behind the scenes\n\n-   `src/` is now 100% TypeScript! This now lays a baseline to start working on improving Puppeteer docs by automatically generating them, shipping type definitions built in (for now we recommend `@types/puppeteer`).\n\n### Raw notes\n\n[`b2488eb`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b2488eb) -

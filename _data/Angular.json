Record specific flag for enabling selection, for example to model user specific rights, is set (for example `row.isSelectable`)\n3. Record is not currently inline edited (for example `row.isEditing`)\n4. (enough for this example)\n\nNow we have the logic if a record is selectable: `if (this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing)`. But now we have to use this logic is multiple places, for example:\n\n1. Enable/disable checkbox for selection (if you want to use checkboxes) (in template)\n2. Apply CSS class through `[ngClass]` (in template)\n3. Check if row is selectable when selection is injected using `ControlValueAccessor.writeValue` (in code)\n\nYou dont want to use a central function because using this function in the template adds a change detection overhead. This leads to code/logic duplication which is hard to maintain if you are not already familiar with the code, for example when another dev wants to add the condition that the row is not selectable when it's currently dragged around.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think about an `@Inline()` decorator. Just like in c/c++ this would not be a command but rather a request to inline. When inlined the code of the function is copied inline into the template, for example:\n```\n@Inline() public isSelectable(row) {\n    return this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing;\n}\n\n<tr\n   [ngClass]=\"{'selectable-row': this.isSelectable(row)}\">\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\nturns into (during compliation):\n```\n<tr\n   [ngClass]=\"{'selectable-row': this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing}\">\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\nSince it's only a request to inline there are scenarios when it's not usefull/possible:\n\n1. When function body contains function calls itself (does not remove overhead)\nException: inner calls are also inline (nested inlining)\n2. When function is overridden\n3. When code is defined thats not valid in the template, for example accessing enum values (maybe still inline but show error)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe explained problem can also be solved by using a pure pipe but using it in the code feels and looks kind of sloppy.\n\n```\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'isSelectable',\n  pure: true\n})\nexport class IsSelecablePipe implements PipeTransform {\n  transform(row, allowSelecting): string[] {\n    return this.allowSelecting && row.isSelectable && !row.isEditing;\n  }\n}\n\nif (new IsSelectablePipe().transform(row, allowSelecting)) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIt's still possible so inline functions would be a convenience feature.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59891","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inline functions for central logic without change detection overhead\" (#59891)"},{"Id":"2839638500","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T07:09:49","Actor":"hannah23280","Number":"59892","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make @injectable optional for components that are already added to providers","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n@angular/core\n\n### Description\n\nAngular v19 - using standalone\n\nCurrently I develop a service called AuthService and added it to the global provider (yes, i don't intend to use @Inject({providedin:'root'}, but don't need to know why, as this is not the crux).\nHowever I notice that if the AuthService  has a constructor that need to be injected with something (e.g HttpClient instance), I still need to apply @Injectable().   \n\n```\n@Injectable() <==this annotation has to be added in order for the DI to work on its constructor.\nexport class AuthService {\n    private readonly http ;\n\n    constructor(hc:HttpClient  ){\n       this.http = hc;\n    }\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nif a custom service has already been added to the provider, its constructor should be implicitly be able to be injected with another service via its constructor by default, rather than force developer to apply @Injectable() .

It's including component styles in `AllCalculator`. For example, on my example application Angular reports that the \"all\" bundle has size 10.627MB when in fact on disk the total size of all javascript and css files is 10.283MB. \n\nI noticed this when calculating stats from `stats.json` locally. If I patch the `AllCalculator`  to ignore assets that are marked as `componentStyle`, then the calculation matches what is on the disk. Those assets are not actually on the disk and their code is already included in other assets.\n\n```diff\n class AllCalculator extends Calculator {\n     calculate() {\n         const size = this.assets\n-            .filter((asset) => !asset.name.endsWith('.map'))\n+            .filter((asset) => !asset.name.endsWith('.map') && !asset.componentStyle)\n             .map((asset) => this.getAssetSize(asset))\n             .reduce((total, size) => total + size, 0);\n         return [{ size, label: 'total' }];\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/523d539c6633ab223723162f425e0ef2b7b4ff71/packages/angular/build/src/utils/bundle-calculator.ts#L241-L250\n\nIt would be also nice if the whole build didn't fail when the budget size goes over `error` threshold. It makes it impossible to update budget values programmatically. :) In Angular 18 & webpack builder, the app was built and there were stats.json even if the budget went over. With Angular 19 & esbuild builder, you don't get the result. :/ \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\ncommand: `ng build --stats-json`\n\nBuilder used: `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.6\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.6\n@angular/cdk                    19.1.3\n@angular/cdk-experimental       19.1.3\n@angular/cli                    19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThe assets in `output` look like this in `stats.json`, which should be excluded from \"all\" budget.\n\n```json\n    \"alert.component-SMKGWBDA.css\": {\n      \"imports\": [],\n      \"inputs\": {},\n      \"bytes\": 52,\n      \"ng-component\": true\n    },\n```\n\nThe test case could be something like\n\n```ts\n    it('does not exceed the total budget', () => {\n      const budgets: BudgetEntry[] = [\n        {\n          type: BudgetType.All,\n          maximumError: '1kb',\n        },\n      ];\n      const stats = {\n        chunks: [\n          {\n            id: 0,\n            initial: true,\n            names: ['foo'],\n            files: ['foo.js', 'bar.css'],\n          },\n        ],\n        assets: [\n          {\n            name: 'foo.js',\n            size: 0.5 * BYTES_IN_KILOBYTE,\n          },\n          {\n            name: 'bar.css',\n            size: 0.5 * BYTES_IN_KILOBYTE,\n          },\n          {\n            name: 'bar2.css',\n            size: 0.75 * BYTES_IN_KILOBYTE,\n            componentStyle: true,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n\n      const failures = Array.from(checkBudgets(budgets, stats));\n\n      expect(failures).toHaveSize(0);\n    });\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29609","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"all\" budget calculation should not include component styles\" (#29609)"},{"Id":"2845789720","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-11T16:47:38","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"29608","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: add aot option to karma","State":"closed","Body":"Rebase version of https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28854/commits.\r\n\r\nConflicts were resolved via running `yarn public-api:update`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29608","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat: add aot option to karma\" (#29608)"},{"Id":"2845009259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-11T16:08:33","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29605","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): remove outdated `allowedHosts` warning","State":"closed","Body":"The warning is no longer accurate, as `allowedHosts` is now used in Vite.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29605","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): remove outdated `allowedHosts` warning\" (#29605)"},{"Id":"2845204380","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-11T12:10:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29607","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): configure Vite CORS option","State":"open","Body":"Vite's `allowedHosts` option does not enable CORS; instead, it allows the dev server to respond to requests with a matching hostname (e.g., http://example.com/main.js).

Examples of such setups include those that use reverse proxies or custom host names during development. The change within a patch release was made by Vite to address a security vulnerability. For projects that directly access the development server via `localhost`, no changes should be needed. However, some development setups may now need to adjust the `allowedHosts` development server option. This option can include an array of host names that are allowed to communicate with the development server. The option sets the corresponding Vite option within the Angular CLI.

When we started using this form of translation we were still using de webpack builder. For testing functionality we were using \"ng build --watch --configuration=developent....\" with in angular.json \"localize\": true for the development configuration. Changed files were the only ones used in an incremental build and we could copy the build to a test-server for functional testing.\nAfter changing to esbuild (as of Angular 17) we noticed a change in behaviour when using the build in watch mode. If only 1 source file changed a whole new rebuild was made. When trying to find the cause of this change we also noticed this complete rebuild after using the touch command an a source file. Disabling localize in the development configuration will solve this change in behaviour, but then we can not test the translations with a regular development build.\n\nIs this change in watch-mode behaviour as it should be? We consider it a bug as this change in behaviour isn't documented.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nReproduction is simple.\nCreate a new app with \"ng new repro-app\" with defaults (CSS and no SSR).\nAdd localization with \"ng add @angular/localize\".\nMake no changes to angular.json.\n\nStart build in watch mode with \"ng build --watch --configuration development --localize=true\"\nMake a change to the stylesheet and see the complete rebuild.\n\nEnd the watch mode and start a new one with localize=false.\nMake another change to the stylesheet and see the incremental build (only stylesheet).\nThis is the same as using the webpack builder with localize=true.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.6\nNode: 20.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.6\n@angular/cli                    19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nWe're currently using Angular 18 for building web-apps but will be migrating to 19 soon.

In this case we would have to change code in our development tool how dev. builds are made and how watch mode is started.\n\nThanks in advance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29586","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Different behaviour build in watch-mode between webpack and esbuild when using @angular/localize\" (#29586)"},{"Id":"2842382637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T15:31:06","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29596","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): exclude unmodified files from logs with `--local…","State":"closed","Body":"Ensures that only modified files are displayed in logs when using the `--localize` flag, preventing unnecessary noise.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29586","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29596","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): exclude unmodified files from logs with `--local…\" (#29596)"},{"Id":"2842560896","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T15:29:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29600","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29600","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies\" (#29600)"},{"Id":"2840238350","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T15:26:22","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29591","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update schematics dependencies to ~5.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm)) | devDependencies | minor | [`~5.5.0` -> `~5.6.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine/5.5.0/5.6.0) |\n| [jasmine-core](https://jasmine.github.io) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine)) | dependencies | minor | [`~5.5.0` -> `~5.6.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/jasmine-core/5.5.0/5.6.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine-npm (jasmine)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/releases/tag/v5.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/compare/v5.5.0...v5.6.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/main/release_notes/5.6.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine (jasmine-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v5.5.0...v5.6.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://redirect.github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.6.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

As far as I can tell, AngularNodeAppEngine removes these \"CR\" characters from the response body but sets the \"Content-Length\" header to be the same as the original index.html file size (as if no modification was performed).\n\nTo reproduce the problem:\n1. Create a fresh Angular project with SSR and server routing;\n2. Run build; \n3. Go to the dist folder and add some CRs (or CRLFs) to index.html and index_html.mjs files;\n4. Run serve:ssr:[project-name];\n5.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.24.2...v0.25.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.24.0` or `~0.24.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Restrict access to esbuild's development server ([GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99))\n\n    This change addresses esbuild's first security vulnerability report. Previously esbuild set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*` to allow esbuild's development server to be flexible in how it's used for development. However, this allows the websites you visit to make HTTP requests to esbuild's local development server, which gives read-only access to your source code if the website were to fetch your source code's specific URL. You can read more information in [the report](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99).\n\n    Starting with this release, [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) will now be disabled, and requests will now be denied if the host does not match the one provided to `--serve=`. The default host is `0.0.0.0`, which refers to all of the IP addresses that represent the local machine (e.g. both `127.0.0.1` and `192.168.0.1`). If you want to customize anything about esbuild's development server, you can [put a proxy in front of esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#serve-proxy) and modify the incoming and/or outgoing requests.\n\n    In addition, the `serve()` API call has been changed to return an array of `hosts` instead of a single `host` string. This makes it possible to determine all of the hosts that esbuild's development server will accept.\n\n    Thanks to [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://redirect.github.com/sapphi-red) for reporting this issue.\n\n-   Delete output files when a build fails in watch mode ([#&#8203;3643](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3643))\n\n    It has been requested for esbuild to delete files when a build fails in watch mode. Previously esbuild left the old files in place, which could cause people to not immediately realize that the most recent build failed. With this release, esbuild will now delete all output files if a rebuild fails. Fixing the build error and triggering another rebuild will restore all output files again.\n\n-   Fix correctness issues with the CSS nesting transform ([#&#8203;3620](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3620), [#&#8203;3877](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3877), [#&#8203;3933](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3933), [#&#8203;3997](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3997), [#&#8203;4005](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4005), [#&#8203;4037](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4037), [#&#8203;4038](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4038))\n\n    This release fixes the following problems:\n\n    -   Naive expansion of CSS nesting can result in an exponential blow-up of generated CSS if each nesting level has multiple selectors. Previously esbuild sometimes collapsed individual nesting levels using `:is()` to limit expansion. However, this collapsing wasn't correct in some cases, so it has been removed to fix correctness issues.\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        .parent {\n          > .a,\n          > .b1 > .b2 {\n            color: red;\n          }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        .parent > :is(.a, .b1 > .b2) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        .parent > .a,\n        .parent > .b1 > .b2 {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Thanks to [@&#8203;tim-we](https://redirect.github.com/tim-we) for working on a fix.\n\n    -   The `&` CSS nesting selector can be repeated multiple times to increase CSS specificity. Previously esbuild ignored this possibility and incorrectly considered `&&` to have the same specificity as `&`. With this release, this should now work correctly:\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code (color should be red) */\n        div {\n          && { color: red }\n          & { color: blue }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        div {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        div {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        div:is(div) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        div {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Thanks to [@&#8203;CPunisher](https://redirect.github.com/CPunisher) for working on a fix.\n\n    -   Previously transforming nested CSS incorrectly removed leading combinators from within pseudoclass selectors such as `:where()`. This edge case has been fixed and how has test coverage.\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        a b:has(> span) {\n          a & {\n            color: green;\n          }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        a :is(a b:has(span)) {\n          color: green;\n        }\n\n        /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n        a :is(a b:has(> span)) {\n          color: green;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;NoremacNergfol](https://redirect.github.com/NoremacNergfol).\n\n    -   The CSS minifier contains logic to remove the `&` selector when it can be implied, which happens when there is only one and it's the leading token. However, this logic was incorrectly also applied to selector lists inside of pseudo-class selectors such as `:where()`. With this release, the minifier will now avoid applying this logic in this edge case:\n\n        ```css\n        /* Original code */\n        .a {\n          & .b { color: red }\n          :where(& .b) { color: blue }\n        }\n\n        /* Old output (with --minify) */\n        .a{.b{color:red}:where(.b){color:#&#8203;00f}}\n\n        /* New output (with --minify) */\n        .a{.b{color:red}:where(& .b){color:#&#8203;00f}}\n        ```\n\n-   Fix some correctness issues with source maps ([#&#8203;1745](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1745), [#&#8203;3183](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3183), [#&#8203;3613](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3613), [#&#8203;3982](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3982))\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly treated source map path references as file paths instead of as URLs. With this release, esbuild will now treat source map path references as URLs. This fixes the following problems with source maps:\n\n    -   File names in `sourceMappingURL` that contained a space previously did not encode the space as `%20`, which resulted in JavaScript tools (including esbuild) failing to read that path back in when consuming the generated output file. This should now be fixed.\n\n    -   Absolute URLs in `sourceMappingURL` that use the `file://` scheme previously attempted to read from a folder called `file:`. These URLs should now be recognized and parsed correctly.\n\n    -   Entries in the `sources` array in the source map are now treated as URLs instead of file paths. The correct behavior for this is much more clear now that source maps has a [formal specification](https://tc39.es/ecma426/). Many thanks to those who worked on the specification.\n\n-   Fix incorrect package for `@esbuild/netbsd-arm64` ([#&#8203;4018](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4018))\n\n    Due to a copy+paste typo, the binary published to `@esbuild/netbsd-arm64` was not actually for `arm64`, and didn't run in that environment. This release should fix running esbuild in that environment (NetBSD on 64-bit ARM). Sorry about the mistake.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with bitwise operators and bigints ([#&#8203;4065](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4065))\n\n    This change removes an incorrect assumption in esbuild that all bitwise operators result in a numeric integer. That assumption was correct up until the introduction of bigints in ES2020, but is no longer correct because almost all bitwise operators now operate on both numbers and bigints. Here's an example of the incorrect minification:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if ((a & b) !== 0) found = true\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    a&b&&(found=!0);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    (a&b)!==0&&(found=!0);\n    ```\n\n-   Fix esbuild incorrectly rejecting valid TypeScript edge case ([#&#8203;4027](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4027))\n\n    The following TypeScript code is valid:\n\n    ```ts\n    export function open(async?: boolean): void {\n      console.log(async as boolean)\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Before this version, esbuild would fail to parse this with a syntax error as it expected the token sequence `async as ...` to be the start of an async arrow function expression `async as => ...`. This edge case should be parsed correctly by esbuild starting with this release.\n\n-   Transform BigInt values into constructor calls when unsupported ([#&#8203;4049](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4049))\n\n    Previously esbuild would refuse to compile the BigInt literals (such as `123n`) if they are unsupported in the configured target environment (such as with `--target=es6`). The rationale was that they cannot be polyfilled effectively because they change the behavior of JavaScript's arithmetic operators and JavaScript doesn't have operator overloading.\n\n    However, this prevents using esbuild with certain libraries that would otherwise work if BigInt literals were ignored, such as with old versions of the [`buffer` library](https://redirect.github.com/feross/buffer) before the library fixed support for running in environments without BigInt support. So with this release, esbuild will now turn BigInt literals into BigInt constructor calls (so `123n` becomes `BigInt(123)`) and generate a warning in this case. You can turn off the warning with `--log-override:bigint=silent` or restore the warning to an error with `--log-override:bigint=error` if needed.\n\n-   Change how `console` API dropping works ([#&#8203;4020](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4020))\n\n    Previously the `--drop:console` feature replaced all method calls off of the `console` global with `undefined` regardless of how long the property access chain was (so it applied to `console.log()` and `console.log.call(console)` and `console.log.not.a.method()`). However, it was pointed out that this breaks uses of `console.log.bind(console)`. That's also incompatible with Terser's implementation of the feature, which is where this feature originally came from (it does support `bind`). So with this release, using this feature with esbuild will now only replace one level of method call (unless extended by `call` or `apply`) and will replace the method being called with an empty function in complex cases:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const x = console.log('x')\n    const y = console.log.call(console, 'y')\n    const z = console.log.bind(console)('z')\n\n    // Old output (with --drop-console)\n    const x = void 0;\n    const y = void 0;\n    const z = (void 0)(\"z\");\n\n    // New output (with --drop-console)\n    const x = void 0;\n    const y = void 0;\n    const z = (() => {\n    }).bind(console)(\"z\");\n    ```\n\n    This should more closely match Terser's existing behavior.\n\n-   Allow BigInt literals as `define` values\n\n    With this release, you can now use BigInt literals as define values, such as with `--define:FOO=123n`. Previously trying to do this resulted in a syntax error.\n\n-   Fix a bug with resolve extensions in `node_modules` ([#&#8203;4053](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4053))\n\n    The `--resolve-extensions=` option lets you specify the order in which to try resolving implicit file extensions. For complicated reasons, esbuild reorders TypeScript file extensions after JavaScript ones inside of `node_modules` so that JavaScript source code is always preferred to TypeScript source code inside of dependencies. However, this reordering had a bug that could accidentally change the relative order of TypeScript file extensions if one of them was a prefix of the other. That bug has been fixed in this release. You can see the issue for details.\n\n-   Better minification of statically-determined `switch` cases ([#&#8203;4028](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4028))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now try to trim unused code within `switch` statements when the test expression and `case` expressions are primitive literals. This can arise when the test expression is an identifier that is substituted for a primitive literal at compile time. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    switch (MODE) {\n      case 'dev':\n        installDevToolsConsole()\n        break\n      case 'prod':\n        return\n      default:\n        throw new Error\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify '--define:MODE=\"prod\"')\n    switch(\"prod\"){case\"dev\":installDevToolsConsole();break;case\"prod\":return;default:throw new Error}\n\n    // New output (with --minify '--define:MODE=\"prod\"')\n    return;\n    ```\n\n-   Emit `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` for string literals derived from property names ([#&#8203;4034](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4034))\n\n    Property name mangling is an advanced feature that shortens certain property names for better minification (I say \"advanced feature\" because it's very easy to break your code with it). Sometimes you need to store a property name in a string, such as `obj.get('foo')` instead of `obj.foo`. JavaScript minifiers such as esbuild and [Terser](https://terser.org/) have a convention where a `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comment before the string makes it behave like a property name. So `obj.get(/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */ 'foo')` allows the contents of the string `'foo'` to be shortened.\n\n    However, esbuild sometimes itself generates string literals containing property names when transforming code, such as when lowering class fields to ES6 or when transforming TypeScript decorators. Previously esbuild didn't generate its own `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comments in this case, which means that minifying your code by running esbuild again on its own output wouldn't work correctly (this does not affect people that both minify and transform their code in a single step).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now generate `/* @&#8203;__KEY__ */` comments for property names in generated string literals. To avoid lots of unnecessary output for people that don't use this advanced feature, the generated comments will only be present when the feature is active. If you want to generate the comments but not actually mangle any property names, you can use a flag that has no effect such as `--reserve-props=.`, which tells esbuild to not mangle any property names (but still activates this feature).\n\n-   The `text` loader now strips the UTF-8 BOM if present ([#&#8203;3935](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3935))\n\n    Some software (such as Notepad on Windows) can create text files that start with the three bytes `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF`, which is referred to as the \"byte order mark\". This prefix is intended to be removed before using the text. Previously esbuild's `text` loader included this byte sequence in the string, which turns into a prefix of `\\uFEFF` in a JavaScript string when decoded from UTF-8. With this release, esbuild's `text` loader will now remove these bytes when they occur at the start of the file.\n\n-   Omit legal comment output files when empty ([#&#8203;3670](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3670))\n\n    Previously configuring esbuild with `--legal-comment=external` or `--legal-comment=linked` would always generate a `.LEGAL.txt` output file even if it was empty. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only do this if the file will be non-empty. This should result in a more organized output directory in some cases.\n\n-   Update Go from 1.23.1 to 1.23.5 ([#&#8203;4056](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4056), [#&#8203;4057](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4057))\n\n    This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain reports from vulnerability scanners that detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n    This PR was contributed by [@&#8203;MikeWillCook](https://redirect.github.com/MikeWillCook).\n\n-   Allow passing a port of 0 to the development server ([#&#8203;3692](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3692))\n\n    Unix sockets interpret a port of 0 to mean \"pick a random unused port in the [ephemeral port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port) range\". However, esbuild's default behavior when the port is not specified is to pick the first unused port starting from 8000 and upward. This is more convenient because port 8000 is typically free, so you can for example restart the development server and reload your app in the browser without needing to change the port in the URL. Since esbuild is written in Go (which does not have optional fields like JavaScript), not specifying the port in Go means it defaults to 0, so previously passing a port of 0 to esbuild caused port 8000 to be picked.\n\n    Starting with this release, passing a port of 0 to esbuild when using the CLI or the JS API will now pass port 0 to the OS, which will pick a random ephemeral port. To make this possible, the `Port` option in the Go API has been changed from `uint16` to `int` (to allow for additional sentinel values) and passing a port of -1 in Go now picks a random port. Both the CLI and JS APIs now remap an explicitly-provided port of 0 into -1 for the internal Go API.\n\n    Another option would have been to change `Port` in Go from `uint16` to `*uint16` (Go's closest equivalent of `number | undefined`). However, that would make the common case of providing an explicit port in Go very awkward as Go doesn't support taking the address of integer constants. This tradeoff isn't worth it as picking a random ephemeral port is a rare use case. So the CLI and JS APIs should now match standard Unix behavior when the port is 0, but you need to use -1 instead with Go API.\n\n-   Minification now avoids inlining constants with direct `eval` ([#&#8203;4055](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4055))\n\n    Direct `eval` can be used to introduce a new variable like this:\n\n    ```js\n    const variable = false\n    ;(function () {\n      eval(\"var variable = true\")\n      console.log(variable)\n    })()\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild inlined `variable` here (which became `false`), which changed the behavior of the code. This inlining is now avoided, but please keep in mind that direct `eval` breaks many assumptions that JavaScript tools hold about normal code (especially when bundling) and I do not recommend using it. There are usually better alternatives that have a more localized impact on your code.

These changes update the docs and `peerDependencies` not to require it.\r\n\r\nThis means that users can remove the BrowserAnimationsModule from their apps, if they weren't using Angular's animations system in their own code or in other dependencies. This has a few advantages:\r\n1. It removes ~16kb of minified JS from production bundle.\r\n2. It resolves a bunch of bugs and memory leaks that were caused by the animations.

Developers must manually add conditional logic in their templates to display a \"No records found\" or similar message.\n\nThis feature request proposes adding a `matNoDataNode `directive to <mat-tree>, similar to the `matNoDataRow `directive available for tables. The `matNoDataNode `directive would allow developers to define a template that is displayed when the tree's data source is empty.\n\nProposed Implementation:\n\n- A new directive, `matNoDataNode`, that conditionally renders a template when the tree's data source is empty.\n\n- Seamless integration with the existing mat-tree API, ensuring consistency with other Angular Material components.\n\n### Use Case\n\nhe `matNoDataNode `directive would enable the following use cases:\n\n1. Displaying a \"No Records Found\" Message\n\nWhen a tree has no data, developers can use `matNoDataNode `to display a user-friendly message, such as \"No records found\" or \"No data available.\"\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\">\n  <!-- Regular tree node definitions -->\n  <mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef=\"let node\">\n    {{ node.name }}\n  </mat-tree-node>\n\n  <!-- NoDataNode template -->\n  <ng-template matNoDataNode>\n    <div class=\"no-data-message\">No records found</div>\n  </ng-template>\n</mat-tree>\n```\n\n2. Custom Empty-State Templates\n\nDevelopers can define custom templates for empty states, including icons, buttons, or additional instructions.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n<ng-template matNoDataNode>\n  <div class=\"no-data-message\">\n    <mat-icon>info</mat-icon>\n    <p>No data available.

The tree is now fully expanded.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMatTree's expandAll() should expand all nodes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the first level nodes are expanded.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.2\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTree): expandAll() only expand the first level\" (#30445)"},{"Id":"2829580732","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-04T09:22:44","Actor":"kai1992cool","Number":"30444","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen applying a theme like below:\n\n```\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  // font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n\n  @include mat.theme(\n    (\n      color: (\n        theme-type: light,\n        primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n      ),\n      typography: Roboto,\n      density: 0,\n    )\n  );\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nWithout the commented code in body tag, the `h1 to h6` tags do not have the default font-family.\n\n\n[Stackblitz mat.theme](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1?file=src%2Fstyles.scss)\n\n---\n\nIn the old method we had the `typography-hierarchy`, set this up and it works great:\n\n\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\n    $theme: mat.define-theme(\n      (\n        color: (\n          theme-type: light,\n          primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n        ),\n        typography: (\n          plain-family: Roboto,\n          brand-family: Open Sans,\n          bold-weight: 900,\n          medium-weight: 500,\n          regular-weight: 300,\n        ),\n        density: (\n          scale: 0,\n        ),\n      )\n    );\n    body {\n      @include mat.core();\n      @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\n    }\n\n    @include mat.typography-hierarchy($theme);\n\n    html {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n[Stackblitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1-ul8bwde7?file=src%2Fstyles.scss,src%2Fmain.ts)\n\nSo the question is how to define the typography for `h1-h6` with `mat.theme(`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nway to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nno way to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material:19\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30444","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`\" (#30444)"},{"Id":"2828749072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T23:09:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30443","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix failing test","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a test that's failing at head.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix failing test\" (#30443)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-02-12T03:30:02.5938467Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1607}

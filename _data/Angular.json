In that source file, `value` is typed in the constructor code as `any` (as seen with the input and return types of the `normalizeTriggerValue` function). In the field declarations of the class however, it is typed as a `string`. Likewise the `input` property for the constructor is typed as `any`.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nWhen looking through the documentation, I was looking for what inputs are accepted for the animation trigger binding. All I could find was this excerpt from the Introduction page:\r\n\r\n> Then, you can bind the trigger to a template expression using standard Angular property binding syntax as shown below, where triggerName is the name of the trigger, and expression evaluates to a defined animation state.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nIn my project, I have on the lint rule that requires all functions to have a defined return type. That proved difficult when I was trying to define functions that return the state name and animation params like so:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@HostBinding('@rotateIcon')\r\nget rotateIconBinding() {\r\n  return this.rotateDegrees === 0 ? this.getDefaultAnimationState : this.getRotatedAnimationState;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected get getDefaultAnimationState() {\r\n  return { value: 'default', params: { rotateDegrees: this.rotateDegrees } };\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected get getRotatedAnimationState() {\r\n  return { value: 'rotated', params: { rotateDegrees: this.rotateDegrees } };\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nAny (preferably all) of the following would help alleviate the issue for me or others that are struggling with the state of the current animation docs:\r\n\r\n1. Create a type definition for the `input` property of `StateValue` like so:\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  import { AnimationOptions } from '@angular/animations';\r\n\r\n  export type AnimationStateInput = string | ({ value: string } & AnimationOptions);\r\n  ```\r\n2. Add a section in the Introduction docs explaining what inputs can be provided (aka the name or an object defined like step 1)\r\n\r\nThe above solutions would fix the documentation problem, but it would also be fantastic if there was some sort of IDE support that could detect available animation states so that when you work with animations, it detects issues at compile time.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No

The server logs the the params correctly\r\n\r\n2nd approach: \r\nMake a get call to the express API:\r\n```typescript\r\n server.get('/api/query-params', (req, res, next) => {\r\n    console.log(queryParams);\r\n    res.send(queryParams);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n``` \r\nThe queryparams are set when the base URL is called. I'm not sure if this is even possible as the timing should be a factor here. \r\nThe API GET will be called in the ngOnInit function. \r\nThis works, but the API call will be done in the client, not before server side rendering.\r\n\r\nAnother strange behavior in this case:\r\nWhen I run ng build, there is an error that the api route is not available. I didn't expect that the ng-build command executes the code but this should be done at runtime?!\r\n\r\nSo there are three questions: \r\n1. Why are the providers always null?\r\n2. Is there an option to make the GET call based on the URL and render it on server side?\r\n3. Why does ng-build execute API calls?!\r\n\r\nI'am new to Angular SSR, but the rare documentation for the new Angular 17 SSR functionality and the not working providers make me struggle.\r\nIf there are any better approaches to solve this?

I prepared a simple repo here: https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss .

However if i define SCSS variable with the same path-value I'm getting error (path can't be resolved), also when it is changed to path relative to app.component.scss (`../angular.png`) it works again. \r\n\r\nIs the new behaviour intentional? \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Path declared in SCSS variable is incorrectly resolved\" (#27007)"},{"Id":"2107838156","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-31T16:51:16","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26995","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add JSON build logs when using the application builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis change implements the capability to display JSON build logs in the terminal instead of a format readable by humans.

Files present in the project root will have priority over a workspace root file. If using a custom postcss configuration file, the automatic tailwind integration will be disabled. To use both a custom postcss configuration and tailwind, the tailwind setup must be included in the custom postcss configuration file.\r\n\r\nThe configuration files must be JSON and named one of the following:\r\n* `postcss.config.json`\r\n* `.postcssrc.json`\r\n\r\nA configuration file can use either an array form or an object form to setup plugins. An example of the array form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"tailwindcss\",\r\n        [\"rtlcss\", { \"useCalc\": true }]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same in an object form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": {\r\n        \"tailwindcss\": {},\r\n        \"rtlcss\": { \"useCalc\": true }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using a custom postcss configuration may result in reduced build and rebuild\r\nperformance.

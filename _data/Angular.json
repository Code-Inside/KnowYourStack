This configuration only affects the URL written to the browser history; the `Location` service continues to normalize paths by stripping trailing slashes when reading from the browser.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```typescript\r\nproviders: [\r\n  {provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: TrailingSlashPathLocationStrategy}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach to the trailing slash problem isolates the changes to the\r\nexisting LocationStrategy abstraction without changes to Router, as was\r\nattempted in two other options (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66452 and https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66423).\r\n\r\nFrom an architectural perspective, this is the cleanest approach for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Separation of Concerns and \"Router Purity\": The Router's primary job is to map a URL structure to an application state (ActivatedRoutes). It shouldn't necessarily be burdened with the formatting nuances of the underlying platform unless those nuances affect the state itself. By pushing trailing slash handling to the LocationStrategy, you treat the trailing slash as a \"platform serialization format\" rather than a \"router state\" concern. This avoids the \"weirdness\" in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66423 where the UrlTree (serialization format) disagrees with the ActivatedRouteSnapshot (logical state).\r\n\r\n2. Tree Shakability: If an application doesn't care about trailing slashes (which is the default \"never\" behavior), they don't pay the cost for that logic. It essentially becomes a swappable \"driver\" for the URL interaction.\r\n\r\n3. Simplicity for the Router: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66452 (consuming the slash as a segment) bleeds into the matching logic, potentially causing issues with child routes or wildcards effectively \"eating\" a segment that should be invisible. This option leaves the matching logic purely focused on meaningful path segments by continuing to strip the trailing slash on read.\r\n\r\n4. Consistency with Existing Patterns: Angular already uses LocationStrategy to handle Hash vs Path routing. Adding \"Trailing Slash\" nuances there is a natural extension of that pattern—it's just another variation of \"how do we represent this logic in the browser's address bar?\"\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16051","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66490","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): Add location strategies to manage trailing slash on write\" (#66490)"},{"Id":"3805426980","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T18:18:19","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"66486","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add doc for typescript-configuration","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nPreviously We've doc like https://v17.angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66486","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add doc for typescript-configuration\" (#66486)"},{"Id":"3805213621","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T18:04:14","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"66483","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs): correct line number highlighting in query examples","State":"closed","Body":"Updates incorrect highlighted line numbers so they match the intended code being referenced in the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1704\" height=\"796\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a486eb01-a04d-48cc-bab2-4d4375a08b2e\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<img width=\"1682\" height=\"752\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d407140-4e31-4df7-a894-98a983800028\" />\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66483","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(docs): correct line number highlighting in query examples\" (#66483)"},{"Id":"3804047572","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:12","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"66475","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): prevent from showing duplicate usage blocks in func…","State":"closed","Body":"…tions API docs\r\n\r\nfixes #66398\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66475","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): prevent from showing duplicate usage blocks in func…\" (#66475)"},{"Id":"3804319647","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:41:25","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"66477","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Show API decorators docs","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #66129\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The API rendering pipeline really needs a refactoring, it's becoming a bit of a mess.

Header/footer appear twice.\n\nDevTools shows **two sibling `app-shell` elements under a single `app-root`** (the root is not duplicated; only the layout is duplicated).

Open the app in the browser.\n5. Edit `src/app/app.html` (add a comment or whitespace), save.\n6. Refresh the browser.\n7. Observe duplicated layout (header/footer). In DevTools, `app-shell` appears twice under a single `app-root`.\n\n### Important\n- This only reproduces with SSR enabled.\n- A non-SSR project does not reproduce the issue.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNo exception is thrown.

This is not the case with a list of small options. This may be partially a mat-option issue as well.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. view page with Talkback on Android\n2. attempt to move through the list (note the jittering and incorrectly moving content)\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSwiping left and right should provide consistent navigation without large UI jumps and page jittering. The element that is being focused should be indicated to the user.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSwipping left and right with standard mobile screen reader navigation on long dropdowns results in UI reloading errors and focus issues. Occasionally, the first or last few elements will function normally but issues occur at the midpoints of these lists.\n\nLooking at other UIs that have a similar element the Multiple Search Selection \"state\" field [here](https://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html) seems very good, UI focus is maintained and there are no large reloading jumps when navigating. Though this is an arbatray dropdown example, and I am sure there are other ones that could be identified.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.0.6\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.9\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): Talkback cannot navigate long dropdowns\" (#32628)"},{"Id":"3796964876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T13:31:58","Actor":"ChristianScheibe","Number":"32627","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatCalendar): Calling \"updateTodaysDate()\" from an effect causes an \"Cannot read properties of undefined\" error","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2\n\n### Description\n\nWe are using the a combination of the viewChildren signal, the input signal and an effect to dynamically update the dates that can be selected by the user and if an css class should be added to a date.\n\nIn the previouse version this worked without problems but after an update this stopped and instead throws an error.

For a better Developer eXperience, I recompiled the docs with this custom theme.\n\nMy understanding is as follows:\n* For a custom theme, there isn't necessarily a direct, systematic relationship between `primary` and `primary-container` colors.\n* `background` properties should ideally use `--mat-sys-*` or `--mat-sys-*-container` color tokens, while the corresponding color properties should use the \"on\" variants (e.g., `--mat-sys-on-primary`) of these tokens to ensure sufficient contrast and semantic consistency.\n\n## Docs Rendering (Custom Theme)\n\nIn the live documentation at https://material.angular.dev/, you can observe an issue by modifying the CSS in the Developer Tools. Setting the following variables:\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  --mat-sys-primary: #005cbb;\n  --mat-sys-primary-container: #096bd0; /* Close to #005cbb, or even equal to it */\n  --mat-sys-on-primary: #fff;\n  --mat-sys-on-primary-container: #fff;\n}\n```\n\ncauses the navbar items to become nearly invisible, especially when `--mat-sys-primary-container` is identical to `--mat-sys-primary`.\n\n<img width=\"734\" height=\"492\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6f0115e-5e80-4683-b33a-199fc876dc9c\" />\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe `app-navbar` component applies the following style:\n\n```css\n[_nghost-ng-c3920750817] {\n  color:var(--mat-sys-primary);\n  background:var(--mat-sys-primary-container);\n}\n```\n\nChanging the `color` to `var(--mat-sys-on-primary-container)` only affects the theme selector:\n\n<img width=\"750\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56b35260-b032-4b9d-a285-6c10ae566ffb\" />\n\nThe other navbar items are affected by this rule, which defaults to the primary color:\n\n```css\n.mat-mdc-button:not(:disabled) {\n  color:var(--mat-button-text-label-text-color, var(--mat-sys-primary))\n}\n```\n\nFrom my current understanding, the theme selector and the buttons should rather use a \"--mat-sys-on-*\" value, as they are used for a text/foreground color.\n\n## Possible fixes\n\nBased on this analysis, several approaches could address the button color issue:\n\n- Use tonal buttons instead of basic buttons in the navbar.\n- Override the `.mat-mdc-button:not(:disabled)` rule specifically within the navbar to use a different color, such as a \"--mat-sys-on-*\" value.\n- Modify the overall background color of the navbar.\n\nIf any of the button solutions are applied, the theme selector's styling should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Next steps\n\nPlease feel free to close this issue if this behavior is intentional or already known, considered a minor issue, or if my understanding of the primary and primary container color usage is incorrect.\n\nIf this issue worth to be fixed, I am willing to create a PR. Please indicate which of the proposed approaches (or any others) would be the most suitable solution.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32619","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(navbar): navbar color usage (primary and primary-container tokens)\" (#32619)"},{"Id":"3786840147","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T23:30:15","Actor":"5am4llen","Number":"32618","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Select): option-overrides style does not propagate down to multi-select options","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n```\n// theme.scss\n\n@include mat.option-overrides((\n    selected-state-label-text-color: red,\n));\n```\n\nWhen multiple selection is enabled in a mat-select component, the options override styling for selected label text color is not applied to the selected options in the drop-down.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/cq2psz5v?file=src%2Fexample%2Fselect-multiple-example.html)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. select one or more options from toppings\n2. select an option from Favorite food\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nthe selected option labels in both drop down menus will appear red. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe selected option labels in the favorite food drop down turn red, and the selected options labels under toppings remain the default green color. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.15\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.14\n- Browser(s): firefox\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Rocky Linux\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32618","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Select): option-overrides style does not propagate down to multi-select options\" (#32618)"},{"Id":"3780824512","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T06:28:59","Actor":"esb-dev","Number":"32615","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(aria/menu): Callback onSelect in menu is not called","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI try to get the selected menuitem:\nIn app.html:\n```\n<div ngMenu class=\"menu\" #formatMenu=\"ngMenu\" (onSelect)=\"onSelect($event)\">\n```\nIn app.ts:\n```\n  onSelect(value: string) {\n    console.log(value);\n    alert('value');\n  }\n```\nbut the function onSelect is not called.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/esb-dev/menu\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

This issue occurs at certain browser zoom levels (e.g., 110%) where fractional pixel values get truncated by the browser.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is in the `_measureScrollHeight()` method, which subtracts `4` from the measured `scrollHeight` to account for the 2px top and bottom padding added by the measuring class. However, when the browser truncates fractional pixels (e.g., `20.4px` becomes `20px`), subtracting `4` can result in a height that's slightly less than what's actually needed, causing a scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChanged the subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()`. This provides a small margin that accounts for fractional pixel truncation, preventing scrollbars from appearing when using decimal line-height values.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.ts`**: Changed subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()` method\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.spec.ts`**: Added test `'should not show scrollbar with decimal line-height values at 110% zoom'` that verifies the fix and would fail if the value was `4`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added a unit test that simulates the fractional pixel truncation scenario\r\n- Test verifies that no scrollbar appears when using decimal line-height values\r\n- Test would fail if the subtraction value was `4`, ensuring the fix is properly validated\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- **Breaking changes**: None\r\n- **Behavior change**: Textareas with decimal line-height values will no longer show unnecessary scrollbars\r\n- **Browser compatibility**: Fixes the issue in Chrome and Edge (and potentially other browsers) at certain zoom levels","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/text-field): fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom\" (#32611)"},{"Id":"3774439243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-02T13:32:21","Actor":"g-cheishvili","Number":"32609","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/accordion): make `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` members protected for extensibility","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request refactors the `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` classes to improve extensibility and internal access for derived classes.

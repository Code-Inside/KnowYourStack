I saw discussions about `@Input` and `Signal` in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50190 and https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49682#:~:text=request%20for%20Angular.-,Signal%2Dbased%20inputs,-In%20signal%2Dbased but they only said about creating a new different decorator for signal inputs or create a totally different component with signal inputs which I think it's not necessary, we can just use what Angular already have and just add an extra option.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy proposal is to add one extra prop to the `@Input()` decorator options called `signal` which will tell Angular to not reassign the input but use the current signal reference to `set` the new value. See this rewrite of the RFC proposal:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'user-profile',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>Name: {{ firstName() }} {{ lastName() }}</p>\r\n    <p>Account suspended: {{ suspended() }}</p>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class UserProfile {\r\n  // Create an optional input without an initial value.\r\n  @Input({ signal: true })\r\n  firstName = signal<string | undefined>(undefined); // Signal<string | undefined>\r\n\r\n  // Create an input with a default value\r\n  @Input({ signal: true })\r\n  lastName = signal('Smith'); // Signal<string>\r\n\r\n  // Create an input with options.\r\n  @Input({ signal: true, alias: 'disabled' })\r\n  suspended = signal(false); // Signal<boolean>\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe proposed solution would work just like if you had used getter and setter to set a private `Signal` value.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Input()\r\nget name(): string {\r\n  return this._name();\r\n}\r\nset name(value: string) {\r\n  this._name.set(value);\r\n}\r\nprivate _name = signal('');\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease, I ask to consider this, I've been waiting for reactive inputs so long, we already have the tools in our hands to make it possible üôè ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50746","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: @Input with signals\" (#50746)"},{"Id":"1760614483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-16T13:11:23","Actor":"devversion","Number":"50745","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: setup to run benchmarks and perform comparisons","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50745","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: setup to run benchmarks and perform comparisons\" (#50745)"},{"Id":"1760294861","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-16T11:06:27","Actor":"infacto","Number":"50743","RawContent":null,"Title":"Get element inside ng-template.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50743","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Get element inside ng-template.\" (#50743)"},{"Id":"1760280015","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-16T09:40:20","Actor":"stanchev89","Number":"50742","RawContent":null,"Title":"NG0908 error observed","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nzone.js, Don't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHey everyone! About a month and a half ago, we included monitoring events in the Angular bootstrap failure events to gain a clearer understanding of all the cases where the app is broken. \r\nWe‚Äôre already aware of the typical errors for unsupported (old) browsers like ‚Äúut.flat is not a function,‚Äù and they‚Äôre not a major concern. \r\nHowever, in the past 3-4 weeks, we‚Äôve been noticing errors named **NG0908**, and their count has reached around 850 per week.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve been trying to gather more information about this particular error, but there isn‚Äôt much available. It‚Äôs not documented in the official Angular error list https://angular.io/errors. The only source I found mentioning this error is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75485862/error-conflict-multiple-chunks-emit-assets-to-the-same-filename-app-js-chunks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you provide assistance in identifying the source of the issue and suggesting appropriate actions to resolve it?\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: NG0908\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.2\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.2.9\r\n@angular/material               15.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n\r\n\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50742","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NG0908 error observed\" (#50742)"},{"Id":"1760276443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-16T09:37:40","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"50741","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update build-tooling package and re-enable RBE for http tests","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the build-tooling package which contains fixes for RBE on Node.js 18.

Angular renders just empty structural directives and doesn't emit any errors.\r\nProblems were spotted with:\r\n```\r\n@ngui/map\r\nng2-file-upload\r\n@ngx-gallery/core\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n1. It is working well in case scss loaders group is working slow and reproducable if it is working fast. Basically we uncovered it when reduced our scss loader build time by 50%.\r\n2. It magically started to work after some random build, then was broken again. So it is 99% compilation related. It seems View Engine modules are compiled in a wrong way from time to time.\r\nIt may be angular/compiler, webpack, nx, ngcc related.\r\n\r\nI've tried to create a minimal reproduction but it was working on a smaller app with exactly same architecture.\r\nSo this issue is looking like a race condition. It seems like scss loaders delayed other loaders but now it isn't doing it causing this issue.\r\nMaybe something `ngcc --create-ivy-entry-points` related.\r\n\r\nIf there are any suggestions or similar issues have been seen it would be great. At least answer on a question: \"how and why View Engine angular libraries may stop working silently on Angular 15?\" will help a lot\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exceptions\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.0\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 8.5.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.7\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, google-maps, language-service, localize\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/builders           15.2.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     15.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modules processed by ngcc aren't working (v15)\" (#50735)"},{"Id":"1759208484","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T16:46:15","Actor":"devversion","Number":"50734","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: speed up remote execution by allowing more concurrent jobs","State":"open","Body":"Bazel detects maximum number of jobs based on host resources.

If I'm navigating through Angular's router no problems, I can go in my root-app, the child-app's router does not react.\r\n\r\nBut, when I'm in my child-app, if I'm modifying the browser url to point to another route of my root-app, the child-app's router is triggered, and cause errors (redirection to a custom made 404 page, and/or errors in console logs).\r\n\r\nI've found nothing in Angular 15 code that filters popState.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if Angular should do the filtering (like done in my alternative solution), or provide a clean way to active/define it.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nSo in my child-app, I came up with this solution, to filter the `LocationStrategy.onPopState` before sending the event to the router.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// there are  // @ts-ignore because I'm accessing private properties\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class CustomHashLocationStrategy extends HashLocationStrategy {\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        platformLocation: PlatformLocation,\r\n        @Optional() @Inject(APP_BASE_HREF) baseHref?: string) {\r\n        super(platformLocation, baseHref);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    override onPopState(fn: LocationChangeListener): void {\r\n        const filteredFn = (event: any) => {\r\n            // we only execute the callback if the browser url contains the this._baseHref\r\n            // @ts-ignore\r\n            if (location.hash.indexOf(this._baseHref) !== -1) {\r\n                fn(event);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        super.onPopState(filteredFn);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nNgModule({\r\n    ...\r\n    providers: [\r\n        {provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: environment.baseUrl},\r\n        {provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: CustomHashLocationStrategy},\r\n        ...\r\n    ]\r\n})\r\n\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50733","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Should LocationStrategy.onPopState filter with APP_BASE_HREF ?\" (#50733)"},{"Id":"1758748691","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T14:15:20","Actor":"shaikhshehzad","Number":"50731","RawContent":null,"Title":"query params subscription fires twice continously for a single query param change ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nquery params subscription fires twice for a single query param change resulting in unnecessary api calls and unwanted execution of code\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nSaw this behavior while debugging\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNONE seen\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nOn load things works fine after adding  or removing params issue is replicable \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nconstructor(\r\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,  \r\n    private router: Router,\r\n) { \r\n\r\nthis.route.paramMap.subscribe((params) => {\r\n   \r\n          this.fnGetQueryParams();\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {}\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nfnGetQueryParams() {\r\n    this.route.queryParams.subscribe((urlparams) => {\r\n})\r\n\r\n}\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50731","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"query params subscription fires twice continously for a single query param change \" (#50731)"},{"Id":"1757172388","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T13:35:23","Actor":"devversion","Number":"50718","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: mark ngtsc test target as flaky","State":"closed","Body":"A larger investigation on why this is flaky is needed.

user .email : null\r\n    }          \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter build become, eg.:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass u extends w.PV {\r\n    constructor(_, t) {\r\n        super(),\r\n        this.translationService = _,\r\n        this.authService = t\r\n    }\r\n    getActiveLang() {\r\n        return this.translationService.getActiveLang()\r\n    }\r\n    getUserMail() {\r\n        const _ = this.authService.currentUser();\r\n        return _ ? _.email : null\r\n    }          \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrivate properties `translationService`, `authService` aren't minify/uglify, the expected output is eg.:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass u extends w.PV {\r\n    constructor(_, t) {\r\n        super(),\r\n        this._ = _,\r\n        this.t = t\r\n    }\r\n    getActiveLang() {\r\n        return this.t.getActiveLang()\r\n    }\r\n    getUserMail() {\r\n        const _ = this._.currentUser();\r\n        return _ ? _.email : null\r\n    }          \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happen because instance properties can leak into basically anywhere, where the minifier is not guaranteed to have applied a consistent minification, eg.:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwindow.svc = new MyService();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then some global script uses `window.svc.translationService` to be available. The private marker does not prevent this; it is a TypeScript only keyword that minifiers don't see.\r\n\r\nSome optimizers are capable of this minification, like Closure Compiler using Advanced optimizations, but you have to follow its strict rules to make everything work that way. **Angular does not integrate/support Closure Compiler though**.\r\n\r\nAll class members declared as protected/private can be uglified. However, since the uglification made by Terser works on .js file there can be no distinction between public and protected/private members.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to prefix after Typescript/Angular-cli build the protected/private members with an underscore or something alike, eg.:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass u extends w.PV {\r\n    constructor(_, t) {\r\n        super(),\r\n        this._translationService = _,\r\n        this._authService = t\r\n    }\r\n    getActiveLang() {\r\n        return this._translationService.getActiveLang()\r\n    }\r\n    getUserMail() {\r\n        const _ = this._authService.currentUser();\r\n        return _ ? _.email : null\r\n    }          \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand pass an option to terser telling it to uglify only members which start with underscore.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n[writing small name for private field](https://github.com/timocov/ts-transformer-minify-privates/issues/26)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25368","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Optimize bundle size by minify/uglify private field\" (#25368)"},{"Id":"1754274843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T09:13:05","Actor":"gultyayev","Number":"25370","RawContent":null,"Title":"Jest compile out folder is not cleared between runs","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWith Jest enabled for the tests the CLI does not clear the `dist` folder from test output.

So why is this added when I'm using legacy?\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'm not really using the legacy button and imported it explicitly in the module where this component is used:\r\n`import { MatLegacyButtonModule } from '@angular/material/legacy-button';\r\nimports: [\r\n\t\tMatInputModule,\r\n\t\tMatFormFieldModule,\r\n\t\tMatButtonModule,\r\n\t\tMatDatepickerModule,\r\n\t]`\r\n\r\nBut that didn't change anything.

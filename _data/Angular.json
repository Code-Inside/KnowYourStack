No error or warning is emitted, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually wanted to do was:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>The count is: {{count}}</div>\r\n<button (click)=\"increment()\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the parenthesis added to `increment()`.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing because it is very easy to think that Angular will call the function in the event binding, when it is really executing the expression, and `increment` is a no-op expression.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAngular should emit an extended diagnostic which it sees an event binding bound to an expression with a callable signature. This would flag the mistake and clearly denote that the developer's intention was to invoke the function with `()`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nA slight variation would be to emit a diagnostic only when the expression is a callable _identifier_, as opposed to any expression. The main difference is whether or not Angular should warn in scenarios where the expression is not an identifier, but we know it's a function such as:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"counter.increment\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's reasonable to emit in this situation. A related issue is where a function returns which the developer doesn't care about such as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-component',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>The count is: {{count()}}</div>\r\n    <button (click)=\"incrementAndLaterDecrement()\">Increment</button>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  protected readonly count = signal(0);\r\n  protected incrementAndLaterDecrement(): () -> void {\r\n    this.count.update((c) => c + 1);\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      this.count.update((c) => c - 1);\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `incrementAndLaterDecrement` does return a function. Should it emit the diagnostic in this scenario?\r\n\r\nI think it should, as the developer is likely misusing `incrementAndLaterDecrement`, but there may be instances where they don't care about the returned function. In those cases I'm thinking they should drop the return value with `void` or maybe just add a semicolon?\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"void incrementAndLaterDecrement()\">Increment</button>\r\n\r\n<button (click)=\"incrementAndLaterDecrement();\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeither of those are super clear to future readers why they are necessary. I kinda like `void` as I tend to see as a mechanism to \"swallow this value so the caller does not consume it\", which seems to fit the intention of \"ignore the curried function\". But `void` isn't super commonly used so I can understand it being unintuitive to others. Also I have no idea if our template syntax supports `void`, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't.\r\n\r\nBasically, we can consider whether we want to restrict this to purely callable _identifiers_ or any callable _expression_. I'm inclined to go with the later, but worth discussing for sure.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended diagnostic error when binding an event to an uncalled function\" (#56293)"},{"Id":"2336805838","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:55:35","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56292","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56292","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release\" (#56292)"},{"Id":"2336760978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:18:06","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56291","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.\" (#56291)"},{"Id":"2336740291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:03:55","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"56290","RawContent":null,"Title":"ComponentFixture.whenStable doesn't detect event emitted from async output in zoneless CD","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn zoneless mode (i.e. with `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()`), a test using autoDetectChanges does not detect the changes caused by the emission of an event by a child output using an async EventEmitter (i.e. `new EventEmitter(true)`).\r\n\r\nTo make things clearer, use the minimal reproduction (see below), and execute the following commands in the terminal:\r\n\r\n- `cd app`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `ng serve`\r\n\r\nNote at this point that clicking the two buttons works as expected: the associated \"hello\" message becomes \"world\".\r\n\r\nNow run `ng test`.\r\n\r\nThe test for the \"Async\" section fails. The difference between the first and the second section is that the first one reacts to a sync output from the child component, whereas the second one reacts to an async output.\r\n\r\nUsing async outputs might seem weird (BTW, this option deoesn't exist with the new `output()` function), but this issue comes from a real use-case where it is actually used (ng-bootstrap's pagination

If so, I would greatly appreciate some advice. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. ng new test-project --ssr\r\n2. update angular.json with \"sourceMap\": true in the production build configuration.  \r\n3. ng build\r\n4. Set a breakpoint in server.ts - it will be red\r\n5. Add \"Launch Program\" configuration to launch.json, with \"program\" pointing to server.mjs and \"sourceMaps\": true \r\n6. Execute \"Launch Program\" debug. \r\n7. The server will start, but the breakpoint in server.ts will become an empty circle - Unbound breakpoint. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI don't think it matters, but I'm using macOS 14.5, VS Code 1.89.1, npm 10.8.1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27773","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't debug Server Typescript in an Angular SSR project  \" (#27773)"},{"Id":"2335469438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T15:12:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add `--inspect` option to the dev-server","State":"closed","Body":"This commit introduces an `--inspect` option to the dev-server, enabling debugging of server-side code when using SSR or SSG.

Create a fresh angular 17 app\r\n1. In VSCode add a `console.error({error})` in the AngularCLI's file `node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.js` in line 80 (inside this `catch` block):\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ea843ebfeaa2e1a232bf199b624f7084e35399b9/packages/angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.ts#L102-L106\r\nsee example:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/4001059/2117bcfa-35b5-4521-a1f1-4170c6bf85f0)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. (run `npm install @my/lib` - to mitigate the bug https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16320 - but ideally this step shouldn't be needed when this other bug is fixed)\r\n1. run `ng add @my/library@<with-version-here>`\r\n1. See an error in the console `error: CollectionCannotBeResolvedException [Error]: Collection \"@my/lib@1.2.3\" cannot be resolved.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27766","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"A silent error is thrown in `AddCommandModule.builder`, when passing a version to the command `ng add @my/lib@<version>`\" (#27766)"},{"Id":"2331207055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-04T18:20:34","Actor":"Platonn","Number":"27767","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): add `schema.json` options to parsed command, also when a version is passed to `ng add <package>@<version>`","State":"closed","Body":"This commit fixes the method `AddCommandModule.getCollectionName()`, so it now returns only the package name, but remove the specified version (if present).\r\n\r\nPreviously, a `@<version>` specified in the const `collectionName` was causing a (silenced) error during the invocation of `workflow.engine.createCollection(collectionName)`, which lead to skipping eventually the invocation of the method `this.addSchemaOptionsToCommand()` in the try/catch block.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27766\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] N/A Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

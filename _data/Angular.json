Two components each use the `CONSTANT_VALIDATORS` export, but form 1 also uses `AbstractControl.addValidators` to apply additional validation to its control. This third validator is unexpectedly pushed into `CONSTANT_VALIDATORS` so form 2 has 3 validation rules rather than the expected 2.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that constructing an AbstractControl with an array of validators would create a shallow copy of the array that can be modified safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.0\r\nNode: 16.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... google-maps, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... youtube-player\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nIn our app a \"required\" validator is added or removed from controls depending on whether they are visible on the screen. This allows us to mark controls that are permission controlled as required via template driven markup such that they are _not required_ for users without permission to view the control or in any other case where the control is not rendered. \r\n\r\nWe also use `FormBuilder` and many forms include controls that are shared from constant (or so we thought) `FormBuilder` configs. For example, `fb.group({ name: null, age: null, ...UserProfileFormGroupConfig })` where individual controls within `UserProfileFormGroupConfig` may have an array of validators.\r\n\r\nWhen these two things are combined we end up with the conditional required validator getting pushed into `UserProfileFormGroupConfig` control validator arrays and stuck there. Forms are marked invalid because of controls that are in the `FormGroup` but not on the screen because they inherited this required validator.\r\n\r\nOur workaround was to refactor the form group config as a function that returns a new config every time to avoid constants. For cases where we were using a shared array of validators like in the StackBlitz example we made sure that the `AbstractControl` constructor received a spread copy rather than the original array.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AbstractControl constructed with an array of validators mutates the original array on control.addValidators()\" (#47827)"},{"Id":"1417161467","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-20T19:44:20","Actor":"kormide","Number":"47826","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(bazel): support ibazel for AIO example playgrounds","State":"open","Body":"@devversion @josephperrott @gregmagolan \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Those have transition of background color defined on them meant to run when user is hovering or clicking. But in our app this transition is running on initial rendering also which results in an annoying flash-like effect (as it transitions from default user-agent defined background to the one set in the css class).\r\nAfter 2 days of debugging I figured that it is related to the fact that we are adding our classes using `[class]` binding as we don't use the emulated encapsulation we have our own engine that creates unique class names. And this doesn't happen consistently e.g. we have 2 elemnts of the same component in the template and only the first one would be rendered without flash and the consequent ones would have a flash. \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15785773/196486750-70dc824d-5f35-496e-9def-5dce36e2a358.mov\r\n\r\nOn the video above you can see the rendering order of the elements. The buttons with `TEXT` written on them have `class=\"myclass\"` hardcoded on them and are rendered instantly with the first cycle. The other 2 are buttons of the select element and classes are applied on them using `[class]=\"'myclass'\"`. And what would happen if I would refreshed the page without breakpoints is that the first element with `[class]=\"'myclass'\"` would appear to be rendered instantly just like `TEXT` but the second one (fourth if you count all of them from top to bottom) would have animation on it.\r\nThis is can be observed in the minimal repro with a much simpler setup (check `extra.component.ts`). What I realized causes it here is the `[style.width.px]=\"ref.offsetWidth\"` somewhere in the template before the element that uses `[style]` binding. But as I remove this in my app I still have the flashing effect until I remove the resolvers from the page, but I obviously need those. So it looks like this happens whenever something is delaying the rerendering of components (as initial Ivy render doesn't apply the bindings).\r\n\r\nI suppose we can work this issue around by adding `transition` into `:hover` and `:active` blocks but would be great if this can be somehow fixed in a normal way. Why does Ivy not apply bindings in the first rendering cycle even though the value for it is already available?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-e2z8fp?file=src/app/extra.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.6\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage manager: npm 8.5.5\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47803","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"In some cases using bindings to add styles/classses leads to unintentional transitions\" (#47803)"},{"Id":"1416530852","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-20T12:24:53","Actor":"malvandi","Number":"47823","RawContent":null,"Title":"instanceof a class in angular library not working","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have an angular project `angular-library-project`([link](https://github.com/malvandi/angular-library-project)).

Our use case in particular is a website builder that allows the user to edit the page inline (and eventually in realtime).

These edge cases are listed below:\n\n    ```js\n    async function test() {\n      class Foo { foo() { return this } }\n      class Bar extends Foo {\n        a = async () => super.foo``\n        b = async () => super['foo']``\n        c = async (foo) => super[foo]``\n      }\n      function foo() { return this }\n      const obj = { foo }\n      const bar = new Bar\n      console.log(\n        (await bar.a()) === bar,\n        (await bar.b()) === bar,\n        (await bar.c('foo')) === bar,\n        { foo }.foo``.foo === foo,\n        (true && obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (false || obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (null ?? obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n      )\n    }\n    test()\n    ```\n\n    Each edge case in the code above previously incorrectly printed `false` when run through esbuild with `--minify --target=es6` but now correctly prints `true`. These edge cases are unlikely to have affected real-world code.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But I have an idea: Angular Material Component could provide a overlay in component context. I'm still not sure what exactly the problem is. Any idea is appreciated. Currently I try to avoid dialogs.

Initially I thought it was just the presence of `*ngIf=\"...\"` on the `mat-radio-button`, but after trying to reproduce I found it was somewhat more subtle than that and seems to require another mat-radio-group in some specific arrangement to trigger the problem.\r\n\r\nI was eventually able to reliably reproduce the error by including a specific element before radio group, which you can see in the stackblitz example, although presumably there are other ways to trigger the issue. For example, in my attached example, the issue only occurs if the broken radio group is placed after the container, but when I originally produced this issue, it did not seem to matter where in the template I placed the broken radio group. \r\n\r\nI found a work around to resolve the issue for the time being, if I use `[value]=\"'value'\"` instead of `value=\"value\"` the component once again works as expected, which you can see in the \"Fixed Radio Group\" in the stackblitz example. Even with this fix, I hope we can identify the underlying issue because it seems tricky enough that other developers could run into it and it may be causing other problems beyond what I'm observing here.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ntbc1n?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,angular.json,src%2Fstyles.css,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ntbc1n?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,angular.json,src%2Fstyles.css,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n2. Notice that although the \"Broken\" and \"Fixed\" Radio Group both use nearly identical code, the \"Broken\" radio group has no checked option initially, but the \"Fixed\" Radio Group works as expected.\r\n3. Try modifying the template to observe how sensitive this issue is to seemingly unrelated context. For example:\r\n4. Removing `*ngIf=\"true\"` from the broken radio group option A will fix the issue.\r\n5. Removing  `*ngIf=\"true\"` from the ngContainer around \"Some Mode\" Radio Group will fix the issue.\r\n6. Deleting the \"Some Mode\" Radio Group (while leaving the container) will fix the issue.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Radio Button that matches the initial value in the FormControl should be selected initially, and the state of seemingly unrelated elements should have no impact on this.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo Radio Button is initially checked in the \"Broken Radio Group\" example, despite using code that seems like it should be functionally identical to the \"Fixed Radio Group\", which is working as expected.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.2.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 106.0.5249.119\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25831","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatRadioGroup): MatRadioButton sometimes not checked initially when using a FormControl\" (#25831)"},{"Id":"1411032818","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-18T12:27:44","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25821","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): animations not disabled with NoopAnimationsModule","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the animations of the slide toggle weren't disabled when using the `NoopAnimationsModule`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): animations not disabled with NoopAnimationsModule\" (#25821)"},{"Id":"1412885012","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-18T09:31:30","Actor":"Arti3DPlayer","Number":"25830","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): Custom input validation message not showing with mat-stepper","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI implemented custom control based on official guides using `ControlValueAccessor`:\r\n\r\n- https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control\r\n- https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-custom-form-controls/\r\n\r\nThe issue that validation error is not showing until we touch our custom field.

This cannot be easily explained by pointing at memory possibly used by other services.\r\n\r\nAttached are two cpu profiles, named appropriately. These were taken on an M1 Max with 32GB RAM.

Absolute files paths are always output with the same basename in the root of the output directory.\r\n* `browser-esbuild` now allows `index` to be optional. It already supported `index` not being set, this just updates the schema.\r\n* `browser-esbuild` now supports an `outExtension` option to configure the output file extension.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR

[`v0.17.17`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01717)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.16...v0.17.17)\n\n-   Fix CSS nesting transform for top-level `&` ([#&#8203;3052](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3052))\n\n    Previously esbuild could crash with a stack overflow when lowering CSS nesting rules with a top-level `&`, such as in the code below. This happened because esbuild's CSS nesting transform didn't handle top-level `&`, causing esbuild to inline the top-level selector into itself. This release handles top-level `&` by replacing it with [the `:scope` pseudo-class](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-scope-pseudo):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    &,\n    a {\n      .b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :is(:scope, a) .b {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Support `exports` in `package.json` for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3058](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3058))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 added the ability to use `extends` in `tsconfig.json` to reference a path in a package whose `package.json` file contains an `exports` map that points to the correct location. This doesn't automatically work in esbuild because `tsconfig.json` affects esbuild's path resolution, so esbuild's normal path resolution logic doesn't apply.\n\n    This release adds support for doing this by adding some additional code that attempts to resolve the `extends` path using the `exports` field. The behavior should be similar enough to esbuild's main path resolution logic to work as expected.\n\n    Note that esbuild always treats this `extends` import as a `require()` import since that's what TypeScript appears to do. Specifically the `require` condition will be active and the `import` condition will be inactive.\n\n-   Fix watch mode with `NODE_PATH` ([#&#8203;3062](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3062))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATH` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously a bug prevented esbuild's watch mode from picking up changes to imported files that were contained directly in a `NODE_PATH` directory. You're supposed to use `NODE_PATH` for packages, but some people abuse this feature by putting files in that directory instead (e.g. `node_modules/some-file.js` instead of `node_modules/some-pkg/some-file.js`). The watch mode bug happens when you do this because esbuild first tries to read `some-file.js` as a directory and then as a file. Watch mode was incorrectly waiting for `some-file.js` to become a valid directory. This release fixes this edge case bug by changing watch mode to watch `some-file.js` as a file when this happens.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/ini</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;410-httpsgithubcomnpminicomparev400v410-2023-04-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`622106a`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/622106a1a0bcd2bc32bfd2e6f9cc45a1a1cb53f7) [#&#8203;205](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/205) add \"align\" and \"sort\" options ([#&#8203;205](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/205)) ([@&#8203;rquadling](https://togithub.com/rquadling))\n-   [`dc64a1a`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/dc64a1a3aa322c0c258383bedcae738aaa67028d) [#&#8203;204](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/204) add bracketedArray option ([#&#8203;204](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/204)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n-   [`6a3cb38`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/6a3cb38b134f674dff1a7b5d3732553e8bace777) [#&#8203;199](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/199) add platform option to force line endings ([#&#8203;199](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/199)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), Francois-Xavier Kowalski)\n-   [`b363ae6`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/b363ae67ddf9b1232daafb3cc2b2b1e5cb656406) [#&#8203;198](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/198) add newline option ([#&#8203;198](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/198)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), Francois-Xavier Kowalski)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`ad4b5d8`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/ad4b5d8423f67d67b8683ac8e809b9dd23fe82e2) [#&#8203;200](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/200) Refactored section split logic ([#&#8203;200](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/200)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), [@&#8203;platinumazure](https://togithub.com/platinumazure))\n-   [`5b5c9b7`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/5b5c9b777209bae480f62fb80149008350d37bc5) [#&#8203;123](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/123) residual space after section causes bad parsing ([#&#8203;123](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/123)) ([@&#8203;Nautigsam](https://togithub.com/Nautigsam))\n-   [`fa2c17e`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/fa2c17e6e5f4ebaec30e08653b9603049c8cf0c3) [#&#8203;201](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/201) ignore all whitespace lines ([#&#8203;201](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/201)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.22`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8422)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.21...8.4.22)\n\n-   Fixed TypeScript support with `node16` (by Remco Haszing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/node-semver</summary>\n\n### [`v7.5.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;750-httpsgithubcomnpmnode-semvercomparev740v750-2023-04-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/compare/v7.4.0...v7.5.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`503a4e5`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/503a4e52fe2b1c6ed1400d33149f7733c8361eed) [#&#8203;548](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/548) allow identifierBase to be false ([#&#8203;548](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/548)) ([@&#8203;lsvalina](https://togithub.com/lsvalina))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`e219bb4`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/e219bb454036a0c23e34407591f921c8edb688e7) [#&#8203;552](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/552) throw on bad version with correct error message ([#&#8203;552](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/552)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n-   [`fc2f3df`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/fc2f3df0b5d25253b3580607e111a9a280d888ca) [#&#8203;546](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/546) incorrect results from diff sometimes with prerelease versions ([#&#8203;546](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/546)) ([@&#8203;tjenkinson](https://togithub.com/tjenkinson))\n-   [`2781767`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/27817677794f592b592bf6181a80a4824ff762b2) [#&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/547) avoid re-instantiating SemVer during diff compare ([#&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/547)) ([@&#8203;macno](https://togithub.com/macno))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.13.3`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4133-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4132v4133-2023-04-15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.13.2...v4.13.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

The first visible index is now calculated based on the relation from the current scrollOffset to the max scrollOffset.\r\nSince the total content size can be off for a larger amount, it is now smoothly corrected and no longer just set to the estimated total content size.\r\n\r\nThe `virtual-for-of.ts` had a bug (?) which made it impossible to measure the size of the last item. This is now fixed, but probably a breaking change.\r\n\r\nScrolling to an index is now implemented. When scrolling to an index, the target offset for the index is calculated based in the estimated item size and a correction in case there is already a difference between the current offset and the current estimated offset. When smooth scrolling is activated, multiple scroll events will occur.\r\n\r\nWhile scrolling to an index, the behavior is different from normal user scrolling. The problem that needs to be solved in this case is, that we are scrolling to an estimated offset, which could be off but cannot be corrected anymore. Therefore, we need to adjust the content offset, even if it increases the amount of error.\r\nThis is done in two steps:\r\n- while scrolling, the rendered range is calculated based in the already scrolled amount in relation to the max scroll distance\r\n- once the target index is rendered for the first time, the content will be ideally adjusted and then no longer modified till the scroll is completed\r\n\r\nThere are some special cases, that need extra care:\r\n- target index is already rendered --> scrolling precisely by the amount of pixels\r\n- estimated target scroll offset is already rendered, but target index is not --> scroll by sizes of rendered items in between  - estimated item sizes for non-rendered items in between\r\n- scrolling to an index which close to the end of the list, so that the remaining items are smaller than the viewport --> scroll to the end as far as possible\r\n\r\nSee #10113\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@mmalerba Can you please provide some feedback here.

So, I am not sure whether it is a real bug or I am missing something.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, this code works in `Stackblits` [(https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-rubl8b)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-rubl8b), but if you try to download this project in your desktop, install and run the Server, it does not work either. So, what am I missing here? Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty Angular 15.2.5\r\n2. Add this code to `app.component.html`: `<div><button mat-button id=\"myId\" (click)=\"loadModule()\">Load Module</button></div><ng-template #container></ng-template>`\r\n3. Add this code to `àpp.component.ts`: \r\n```\r\n@ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef })\r\ncontainer!: ViewContainerRef;\r\n\r\nloadModule() {\r\n    this.container.clear();\r\n    const compMetadata = new Component({\r\n      standalone: true,\r\n      selector: 'selector',\r\n      imports:[NgIf,\r\n        MatFormFieldModule,\r\n        MatInputModule,\r\n        ReactiveFormsModule],\r\n      schemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ],\r\n      template: `\r\n      <mat-form-field class=\"example-full-width\">\r\n        <mat-label>First name</mat-label>\r\n        <input matInput maxlength=\"10\">\r\n        <mat-hint>Errors appear instantly!</mat-hint>\r\n        <mat-error *ngIf=\"true\">\r\n          First Name is <strong>required</strong>\r\n        </mat-error>\r\n      </mat-form-field>`,\r\n      styles: [''],\r\n    });\r\n    const dynamicComponent = Component(compMetadata)(class MyCustomComponent {});\r\n    const ref = this.container.createComponent(dynamicComponent as Type<unknown>);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Add `import \"@angular/compiler\";` to `main.ts`\r\n4. Run Server\r\n5. Test\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should show the `Input` with the Angular Material styles and behavior\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt only shows a regular `Input` with the labels and no behavior.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.2.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Edge and Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26944","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material: Not rendering using `new Component()`\" (#26944)"},{"Id":"1670087587","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-16T18:39:17","Actor":"ibrahimgabsi","Number":"26943","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-bottom-sheet): custom form validation is executed multiple times","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n13.3.9\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor one single change inside a form with custom validation, the `validate()` method is triggered multiple times.\r\nThe parameter is, first time, the form control where the change is applied, then the parent form group, and finaly the abstracted control.\r\nThis behavior occurs only within a form inside `mat-bottom-sheet` and starting from the version **14.x.x**.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

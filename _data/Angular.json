Each sub-feature, whether static or dynamic, requires its own instances of the providers. To ensure this, I need a distinct `<router-outlet>` for each sub-feature so that the component attached there can access its parent component's providers.\n\nProviding these providers via the route configuration is not feasible because the instances need to be tied to the lifecycle of the parent component:\n=> The providers must be destroyed along with their parent component.\n=> The providers must be re-initialized when their parent component is initialized.\n\n### Example:\n```html\n<app-feature-page>\n  <app-static-sub-feature> <!-- declared in its own @Component({ providers: [...] }) -->\n    <router-outlet name=\"staticSubFeature\" />\n  </app-static-sub-feature>\n\n  @for (item of items; track item.id) {\n    <app-dynamic-sub-feature> <!-- declared in its own @Component({ providers: [...] }) -->\n      <router-outlet name=\"dynamicSubFeature-{{ item.id }}\" />\n    </app-dynamic-sub-feature>\n  }\n</app-feature-page>\n```\n> This example is intentionally simplified to illustrate the problem. I can provide a more concrete use case if needed.\n\nThe core issue lies in the route configuration. While it's possible to have a dynamic `name` attribute in the HTML template, this doesn't work at the route configuration level:\n```ts\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  // ... other routes ...\n  { path: '...', outlet: 'dynamicSubFeature-xxx' } // <= No way to tell Angular how to retrieve a dynamically named outlet\n];\n```\n\n#### Angular doesn't provide a mechanism to define route targets for dynamically named `<router-outlet>`s in the route configuration. This prevents proper routing to `<router-outlet>`s that are created dynamically in the template.\n\n### Current Workaround and its Drawbacks:\n\nCurrently, to achieve the desired behavior of conditionally displaying components within dynamically generated sub-features while maintaining distinct provider scopes, I've implemented a workaround using `*ngComponentOutlet` and query parameters.\n\nInstead of relying on named `<router-outlet>`s and path-based routing for the sub-feature components, I dynamically render components using `*ngComponentOutlet` based on a query parameter:\n```ts\n@Component({\n    ....,\n    providers: [Foo, Bar] // <= the providers used by either/both this component or/and its sub components, etc.\n    template: `\n        ....\n        @if (displaySubFeatureSubComponent$ | async) {\n            <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"SubFeatureSubComponent\" />\n        }\n    `,\n})\nexport class SubFeature {\n    protected readonly SubFeatureSubComponenp = SubFeatureSubComponent;\n\n    readonly id = input.required<string>();\n\n    private readonly activatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);\n    protected readonly displaySubFeatureSubComponent$ = this.activatedRoute.queryParamMap().pipe(\n        map((queryParams) => queryParams.get('subfeature') === this.id()) // instead of { path: 'subfeature/:id' }\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThis approach involves:\n- Replacing `<router-outlet>` within each sub-feature with `<ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"...\">`\n- Instead of defining routes with specific paths for sub-components, the display of these components is controlled by a query parameter (e.g., `?subfeature=someId`)\n- The `displaySubFeatureSubComponent$` observable checks the query parameter against the sub-feature's ID to determine whether to render the sub-component.\n\nWhile this workaround functions as expected in terms of achieving isolated provider instances and conditional rendering, it is **unconventional and introduces several drawbacks** like the loss of standard routing semantics: It deviates from the standard Angular routing paradigm, making the application's navigation logic less intuitive and harder to understand for new developers on the project\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nTo address the limitation of targeting dynamically named `<router-outlet>`s, I propose enhancing the `Route['outlet']` configuration to support regular expressions or a dedicated pattern-matching syntax. This would enable developers to define route targets that can match outlet names based on a defined pattern.\n\nOne potential implementation involves allowing a `RegExp` object to be assigned to the outlet property in the route configuration:\n```ts\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  // ... other routes ...\n  { path: '...', outlet: /^dynamicSubFeature-\\d+$/ }\n];\n```\n\nIn the template, the dynamic outlet would be set like this:\n```html\n<a [routerLink]=\"['', { outlets: { [`dynamicSubFeature-${id}`]: [''] } }]\">...</a>\n\n<router-outlet name=\"dynamicSubFeature-{{id}}\" />\n```\n\nMy initial investigation of the Angular Router's source code suggests that this approach is technically feasible with relatively minor modifications. Specifically, the [`getOutlet` and `sortByMatchingOutlets` methods](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages%2Frouter%2Fsrc%2Futils%2Fconfig.ts#L225-L237) could be adapted to handle RegExp objects:\n```diff\nexport function getOutlet(route: Route): RegExp {\n- return route.outlet || PRIMARY_OUTLET;\n+ const outlet = route.outlet || PRIMARY_OUTLET;\n+ return typeof outlet === 'string' ? RegExp(outlet) : outlet;\n}\n\nexport function sortByMatchingOutlets(routes: Routes, outletName: string): Routes {\n- const sortedConfig = routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r) === outletName);\n+ const sortedConfig = routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r).test(outletName));\n- sortedConfig.push(...routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r) !== outletName));\n+ sortedConfig.push(...routes.filter((r) => !getOutlet(r).test(outletName)));\n  return sortedConfig;\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile using `RegExp` is my initial thought, other approaches could be considered:\n\n- Special Syntax: Introducing a specific syntax within the outlet string (similar to path wildcards or parameters) to define patterns. For example: `'dynamicSubFeature-*'`, `'dynamicSubFeature-{id}'`.\n- Dedicated identifier Key: Adding a new identifier key to the Route configuration specifically for matching dynamic outlet names. This could potentially leverage the `@for` `track` expression's logic or a similar mechanism.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60770","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow `RegExp` (or Pattern Matching) for named router outlet targets in route configuration\" (#60770)"},{"Id":"2976230932","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T09:33:12","Actor":"coder-ashwin","Number":"60768","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: Debounce in signal / httpResource","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to make a get API call whenever the user searches but with a debounce time in httpResource.\n\nI am open to contributing a PR for this, I wanted to know if this is a right thing to ask and if yes then I wanted to discuss which approach would be the best\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI could think of these 2 solutions, let me know if there's anything better: \n1. debounceTrack function similar to untracked function\n2. debounce property in the options of signal primitive\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere is a workaround to do this -> toSignal(toObservable(searchSignal()).pipe(debounceTime(500)))\n\n2 Reasons I am not doing this:\n- After signals, I was using RxJs only for 3 things, switchMap, takeUntil and debounce.

Maybe your safe from chapter 11. I seen chapt 11 (led by bright eyes JUNIORS) committing to javascript/closure/functional programming it does not scale... its scaled right into chapt11 too big to manage or get under control. It's UNMANAGEABLE. If google has placed such trust in its juniors they may know there are good design consultants in the field fuming.\n\nAngular and NgRX need to be rolled back to version 12 and revisited architecturally and use classes instead of throwing functions at the wall. There is not a shred of object oriented design well unless your an object/property javascripter thats all they see for object oriented and thats as far as it goes. Angular is an object oriented framework. The neglect and omission of es6 classes is outright tragic and cites short sighted architecture of incredibly biased react/javascript/closure hands on. Anyone can throw together interfaces and do some generic and inheritance but thats the brick wall it goes no further. And thats the short-sighted design. The NgRX action worked flawlessly as a class and its regressed just like this... gone. And having used angular since 2014 its high velocity is now being driven into the slow lane or breakdown lane by JAVASCRIPT.\n\nUnless someone is going to take accountability to the impact the bloat and the regressions they are imposing onto the field.\n\nIf property descriptors & decorators can be processed by Signals please send me off with my tail between my legs.\n\nThanks for your responsible solution to my model above.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60759","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"no interfaces signal for property descriptors\" (#60759)"},{"Id":"2974908195","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-06T13:36:06","Actor":"ph360","Number":"60762","RawContent":null,"Title":"npm deprecated warning when i run: npm ci","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n\nHi\n\n**If i run** \nC:\\pr360-portal-v3\\pr360>**npm install**  all ok\n\nup to date, audited 935 packages in 3s\n\n156 packages are looking for funding\n  run `npm fund` for details\n\nfound 0 vulnerabilities\n\n_**but**_\n\n**if i run: i show me the follow warm**\n\nC:\\pr360-portal-v3\\pr360>**npm ci**\nnpm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory.

Each major version will choose a date shortly before release and pin its version support to the \"widely available\" Baseline of that date.\r\n\r\nThere's a few motivations behind this policy change:\r\n1. This gives a more explicit and well-defined browser support policy.\r\n2. This pins the support policy for each major version. Historically, \"2 most recent versions\" is vague about what date it is most recent to. Is it the release date of a particular major version, a particular patch version, the current date?\r\n3. This aligns us with the rest of the web ecosystem, which is moving towards Baseline as a mechanism for defining feature/browser support.\r\n4.

Prior to this, expressions like \"last 2 Chrome versions\" were relative to the installed `caniuse-lite` version and could update at any time. By pinning `.browserslistrc`, we're ensuring that supported browsers only change during Angular major version updates, not arbitrary `caniuse-lite` updates.\r\n\r\nAngular CLI now warns if users define a custom `.browserslistrc` which includes browsers beyond Angular's support policy, however we do not error or prevent it, given that Angular is pretty stable as a framework and generally does not _require_ newly released web features, so targeting older browser versions is very likely to work. However we still warn in this case because it is explicitly outside Angular's support policy and is not _guaranteed_ to work.\r\n\r\n`bl2bl` is used as a dev dependency which generates a `.browserslistrc` that is vendored in the NPM package. This reduces proliferation of the dependency where not needed. Shout out to @tonypconway for building `bl2bl`, which makes managing this configuration significantly easier.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for notes on the implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30036","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update `.browserslistrc` to use Baseline\" (#30036)"},{"Id":"2973372338","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T21:08:58","Actor":"atscott","Number":"30034","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove \"experimental\" from zoneless and add prompt for new apps","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits. \r\n\r\nBlocked by https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60748","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30034","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove \"experimental\" from zoneless and add prompt for new apps\" (#30034)"},{"Id":"2972787503","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T18:27:23","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30032","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): generate resolvers with a dash type separator","State":"closed","Body":"To align with the updated style guide, Angular v20 will generate resolvers with file extension `resolver` type prefixed with a `-` separator instead of a `.` by default.

The ordering of the layer always needs to be the first @layer rule, otherwise it's ignored.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n(with @angular/cli@18.2.3 active) \n* run `ng new layertest`\n* Add a few lines of css to `src/styles.scss`:\n```css\n@layer layer1,layer2;\n\n@layer layer1 {\n  * {\n    outline-style: none;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n  }\n\n  .layertest {\n    background: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n\nhtml,\nbody {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\nhtml {\n  min-height: 100%;\n}\n\n\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n@layer layer2 {\n  @-webkit-keyframes p-fadein {\n    0% {\n      opacity: 0;\n    }\n    100% {\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  .layertest {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\n.layertest {\n  height: 200px;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n````\n\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\n* Load the page in the browser, view the HTML code served\n* Update Angular to 19.2.5 by `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\n* Load the page in the browser, view the HTML code served and recognize that the layer ordering (`@layer layer1,layer2;`) is missing\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.6\n@angular/cli                    19.2.6\n@schematics/angular             19.2.6\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30031","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"inlineCritical CSS breaks CSS layer order\" (#30031)"},{"Id":"2971673340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T14:49:05","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30027","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): provide a default for the ng-packagr project option","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis option is now considered optional\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30027","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): provide a default for the ng-packagr project option\" (#30027)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2978269107","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T00:15:48","Actor":"mantism","Number":"30823","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): Add \"disabledInteractive\" input to \"mat-chip-option\"","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nI want to be able to set \"disabledInteractive\" on `mat-chip-option` similarly to how the `mat-button` component allows tooltips for disabled buttons when \"disabledInteractive\" is passed as an input.\n\nSee `disabledInteractive` in https://material.angular.io/components/button/api\n\n### Use Case\n\n I find myself dynamically disabling chips, and it'd be nice to be able to explain to users why a chip option is disabled with a tooltip instead of having to place the error somewhere else in the DOM or use some element-wrapping workaround.

Configure `<mat-table>` tag with `cdkDropList cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\"` attribute\n2. Configure columns `<mat-header-cell>` tag with `cdkDrag` attribute\n3.

You should see an error in provided code of mat-table\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected that mat-table should work normally with undefined dataSource. If source is empty, no rows exists, it's simple. Why I need to write some workaround like `<mat-table [dataSource]=\"dataSource || []\"`? It's one of weakness of mat-table. And I think while data didn't load, it shouldn't start to render rows.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`mat-table` tries to render undefined rows, so error happened. After this error mat-table work in unexpected way. For example becomes something wrong with fixed columns.

This enhancement would allow dialogs to expand to occupy the entire viewport, providing a more immersive experience for content-heavy dialogs while maintaining the existing Dialog API.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0eea513-124c-4de1-af8d-6f20db23351d)\n\n#### Problem Statement\nThe current Angular Material Dialog component is limited to fixed or responsive sizing within the viewport. While this works well for typical dialog use cases, there are scenarios where a full-screen dialog would provide a better user experience.\n\nDevelopers currently work around this limitation by:\n- Creating custom full-screen components outside the Dialog system\n- Using CSS hacks to force dialogs to expand beyond their intended size\n- Implementing non-standard patterns that break Material Design guidelines\n\nThese workarounds lead to inconsistent implementations, maintenance overhead, and potential accessibility issues.\n\n#### Proposed Solution\nEnhance the MatDialog service and related components to support a new `fullScreen` configuration option that, when enabled, renders the dialog at 100% width and height of the viewport, with appropriate transitions and behaviors aligned with Material Design principles.\n\n#### References\n- [Material Design Dialog component](https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/overview)\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Complex forms\n- Detail views with rich content or multiple sections\n- Mobile-friendly interfaces\n- Media viewers (images, videos, documents)\n- Workflow wizards with complex steps\n- Rich text editors\n- Content creation interfaces","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30819","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(dialog): Full-screen dialog\" (#30819)"},{"Id":"2971426366","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T13:00:24","Actor":"lvjoebro","Number":"30794","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(matTooltip): Tooltip doesnt work when page is launched in mobile mode","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTooltips don't work if the page is opened in mobile mode.\n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.

Hence, everything else from the form up to its container (component, modal, or anything else) are not being garbage collected. Hence, memory is hugely leaking (See image below of nodes piling up).\r\nA very simple sample demo has been uploaded as an example to represent this issue in its minimum expression. It is a very simple two page app: an auth page with a single input field (template driven form) and the explore page to simplify things up. There are 2 buttons inside the auth page; one of them is the submit button of the form. Both buttons navigate to the explore page. (Is done this way to detect the possible issue). \r\nThe explore page has a button to navigate back to the auth page and close the loop. \r\n\r\nTo prove the issue, we navigate back and forth using only the buttons (completely ignoring the input field). \r\nWe just keep routing back and forth pressing the buttons. The result is the expected behaviour where garbage is collected.\r\nThis also proves that the issue is unrelated to the router.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711021-00cb4f00-af2b-11ea-8939-5d23e895b9b3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711492-1f7e1580-af2c-11ea-9abd-87bba4a84baa.png)\r\n\r\nPROBLEM DETECTED:\r\nThe memory leaks bubbles out whenever the form is dirty, in other words, when something is typed in the input field and the form is dirty before navigating. If we navigate back and forth and we keep typing in the simple input field, then the memory leak clarifies.\r\n\r\nFirst Iteration:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711267-8b13b300-af2b-11ea-978f-0b35c11e0a64.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711440-fe1d2980-af2b-11ea-90d7-ff879a1bc94d.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84714593-c1553080-af33-11ea-8fa5-82285e3574ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Iteration:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711378-d037e500-af2b-11ea-93b4-1b88b7bbc366.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711459-08d7be80-af2c-11ea-9553-91287fab404c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84714614-cd40f280-af33-11ea-9bd8-391f3bbaf258.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please note that this demo was created solely to describe and mark up this bug behavior. The actions described here may not represent actual practical uses for angular forms.

The compiler has to ability to statically evaluate expressions\r\nthe best it can, but there can be occurrences when an expression cannot be\r\nevaluated statically. For instance, the evaluation could depend on a dynamic\r\nvalue or syntax is used that the compiler does not understand. Alternatively,\r\nit is possible that an expression could be statically evaluated but the\r\nresulting value would be of an incorrect type.\r\n\r\nIn these situations, it would be helpful if the compiler could explain why it\r\nis unable to evaluate an expression. To this extend, the static interpreter\r\nin Ivy keeps track of a trail of `DynamicValue`s which follow the path of nodes\r\nthat were considered all the way to the node that causes an expression to be\r\nconsidered dynamic. Up until this commit, this rich trail of information was\r\nnot surfaced to a developer so the compiler was of little help to explain\r\nwhy static evaluation failed, resulting in situations that are hard to debug\r\nand resolve.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds much more insight to the diagnostic that is produced for static\r\nevaluation errors. For dynamic values, the trail of `DynamicValue` instances\r\nis presented to the user in a meaningful way.

That has been fixed through a few PRs but the docs on these PRs by themselves are now incorrect and do not clarify a few things:\r\n\r\n[`SwRegistrationOptions`](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions) docs need to be updated for the `registrationStrategy` key.\r\n\r\n- The default registration strategy is now wait for app to stabilize or 30 seconds whichever comes first. It does not mention this very important second part about the 30 second timeout.\r\n- `registerWhenStable` actually supports `registerWhenStable:<timeout>`, this is how the above is implemented. See here for internally using [this](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/service-worker/src/module.ts#L104)\r\n- It should be safe to use the example [here](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-communications#checking-for-updates) due to the above default strategy change. This should be noted if you use a custom strategy that it can potentially break things.\r\n  - Previously the examples using intervals were unsafe\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to go down a rabbit hole of issues and PRs to figure out that it is actually now safe to use interval to check for updates. I am happy the actual code is fixed but it would be nice to get the docs updated to reflect this more clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13351\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34464\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/commit/29e8a64cf02fa9b80d38c30091e0b730403c54c8#diff-d3f0f5f34efd2b679fc85854b84a281a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37580","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Update service worker registration docs to reflect update interval fixes\" (#37580)"},{"Id":"638443353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-14T22:29:41","Actor":"marianazangrossi","Number":"37579","RawContent":null,"Title":"Include the injector name in error: Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding Angular module","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> This feature request is for @angular/upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn the project I'm working we are migrating AngularJS to Angular 2+ and we face this error often: `Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding Angular module.` It would be very helpful to include the injector name in the error message, it would save a lot of time instead of search each injector until finding the one which is throwing this error.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n`Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding 'Angular module.

However there is a specific situation in the upgrade package that could arguably be considered a bug.\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/core.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`NgZone.isInAngularZone()`, is a static method, which means that it can only answer if we are currently running in any Angular Zone, rather than the one for the \"current\" application.\r\n\r\nAngular has always been designed to support multiple applications running on a single page. While the CLI is not particularly conducive to this situation, that does not change this design intent. \r\n\r\nHowever, by default, each application will have its own NgZone, and underlying zone. Thus if you have two apps called App1 and App2, they will have different zones, unless you go out of your way to avoid that.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you cannot tell which one you are running in. `NgZone.isInAngularZone()` will return true regardless of which of App1 or App2's zone you are running in. Now this is not always a particularly huge deal. That API is only used twice in angular outside the tests or assertions. The first is to print a warning message if navigation is triggered \r\n\r\nHowever, if used in a pattern like this: `NgZone.isInAngularZone() ? cb() : ngZone.run(cb)`, that is a problem, since the zone we are currently running in could be the one for App2, when the callback needs to run in the zone for App1. If that code seems at all unlikely, it shouldn't, since it came from this repository. It only runs when using `downgradeModule()`, but it is still arguably buggy:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d1ea1f4c7f3358b730b0d94e65b00bc28cae279c/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component.ts#L90\r\n\r\nI expect a very similar pattern occurs from time to time in third party libraries, or even in application code. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIdeally there would be an instance method on NgZone that would return true if you are running in that specific zone.\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally the existing static methods would be deprecated, in favor of new versions named something like `IsInAnyAngularZone`, to indicate that it returns true if you are in any such zone. This would encourage existing users of this api to decide if they they are concerned with running in the zone for a specific app, or if they care about running in any angular zone. For example, some code may simply want to make sure it is running outside of any angular zone for performance or correctness reasons. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nA different possibility would be to move the zone to the platform level, and force all apps to use the same zone. That would be a big breaking change, with implications on several other apis. It also eliminates the change-detection speedup that comes from each app having their own zone.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to distinguish between different NgZones used on the same page\" (#37577)"},{"Id":"638338646","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-14T12:02:10","Actor":"h3d0","Number":"37576","RawContent":null,"Title":"Lazy-loaded module import increases the size of main.js","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\nUnable to specify which package exactly might cause the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nUnable to confirm whether this is a regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdding imports in the lazy-loaded module increases the size of the **main.js** file, although one would expect to increase the size of **the lazy-loaded chunk instead**.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n1.

But the wrong http headers information is set (or overwritten) by the information which is set in the sockjs-node. \r\n\r\nMy get call in the service looks like this:\r\n```\r\n  getUsers(): Observable<IUser[]> {\r\n    const url = `${this.backendApiUrl}/api/users`;\r\n    const token = this.authService.getTokenFromLocalStorage();\r\n    console.log('####-user-service', token);\r\n    return this.http.get<IUser[]>(url, {\r\n      headers: new HttpHeaders().set('authtoken', token),\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe token property from local storage is the correct token but the sockjs-node call has a different token and that is applied to my HttpHeader.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nIf you have in the sockjs-node info call the same request header set, this will be transferred to the set Headers in backend call.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nnot authorized because wrong auth token is provided\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.2\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                     6.0.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17938","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"socksjs-node caches old information, setting HTTP Headers fails\" (#17938)"},{"Id":"638919324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T14:55:23","Actor":"clydin","Number":"17937","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions","State":"open","Body":"This adds links to current migration guides for several of the migrations as well as adjusts some of the descriptions to provide additional inline information.\r\n\r\nBlocked on migration guide inclusions:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37512\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37429\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37402","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17937","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions\" (#17937)"},{"Id":"638610335","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T13:17:04","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17936","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to version","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n:wrench: This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Specifically, color support checking is now done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1cd51e64c7331a9cc48d59e8fd6df74d3c6c48f3/packages/angular/cli/utilities/color.ts#L11-L14\r\n\r\nAlas, when node is run within a MINGW terminal (as installed by git for windows), `process.stdout` is a `Socket`, causing `instanceof WriteStream` to return false, and all use of colors by the angular CLI to be disabled, even though the MINGW terminal supports colors just fine ...\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Typings do not contain the function call (added in Node.js v9.9.0)\r\nexport const supportsColor =\r\n  process.stdout instanceof WriteStream\r\n  && ((process.stdout as unknown) as { getColorDepth(): number }).getColorDepth() > 1 \r\n  || process.env.MSYSTEM; // MINGW terminals support color even though nodejs mistakes them for a Socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can submit a PR to that effect.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might prefer to delegate to angular_devkit/core/src/terminal/caps.ts instead, whose vendored implementation of `supportsColor` still contains my earlier fix. However, not knowing your policy for dependencies across npm packages I don't feel comfortable submitting a PR to that effect.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17924","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"webpack output is no longer colored in git bash (again)\" (#17924)"},{"Id":"637946662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T18:58:17","Actor":"kgajera","Number":"17922","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): throw error when specified project does not exist","State":"open","Body":"Adds a check to see if the specified project exists, otherwise throws an error.

Description\r\nHey\r\n\r\nCurrently I have been using Nginx with my Angular build and its directly pointed towards Angular output path i.e. /dist folder and serving it from there itself.\r\n\r\nBut what happens is when I run `ng build --prod` on the server then it remove the old build first from the output folder and then compile the new build from the source code and till the time the process completed my Nginx throws `internal server error`.\r\n\r\nI know the option `--deleteOutputPath=false` where you can specify ng build to not delete the output path files but it just keeps on adding files which I think is not a good option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere should be an option in ng build like `--preserveOutputPath=true` where if given will not delete any content from the output path until the compilation is done and then replaces the new build files with the old build files.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAs I am using Ansible to deploy and build angular app on server I have to specify different output path while building app and then replaces that one's files with the output path (/dist) files which is an additional task needed to perform.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option in ng build to preserve build files until compilation is

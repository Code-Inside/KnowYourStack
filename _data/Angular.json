There is no ergonomic, first-class way to work with “reactive collections” like `SignalMap<K, V>`, `SignalArray<T>`, or `SignalSet<T>` that:\n\n- track dependencies **per key / per index / per element** (fine-grained invalidation),\n- support structural reads like `size`, `length`, `keys()`, `entries()`, etc.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nOn top of the existing primitives in `@angular/core/primitives/signals`, provide **reactive collection types** (or official patterns) such as:\n\n- `SignalMap<K, V>` – keyed collection with per-key and structural reactivity;\n- `SignalArray<T>` – array-like collection with per-index and structural reactivity;\n- `SignalSet<T>` – set-like collection with per-element membership and structural reactivity.\n\n#### Desired semantics for SignalMap<K, V>\n\n1. **Per-key dependency tracking**\n\n   - `map.get(key)` should register a dependency on *that key*.\n   - `map.set(key, value)` should only invalidate consumers that actually read this key.\n\n2. **Structural reactivity**\n\n   - Structural reads like `map.size`, `map.keys()`, `map.entries()` should depend on the \"structure node\" of the map (they update when keys are added/removed).\n   - Reads of `map.values()` / `map.entries()` should depend on both structure and each per-key value.\n\n3. **No leaks for non-existent keys**\n\n   - Calling `map.get(key)` for a key that does not exist should not create a “phantom” node for that key.\n   - Instead, it should depend on a structural node that is notified when the key first appears.\n\n#### Desired semantics for SignalArray<T>\n\n1. **Per-index dependency tracking**\n\n   - `array.at(index)` (or `array[index]`) should register a dependency on that index.\n   - `array[index] = value` invalidates only consumers that read that index.\n\n2. **Structural reactivity**\n\n   - Structural reads like `array.length`, `array.keys()`, `array.entries()`, `array.forEach(...)` depend on a structural node.\n   - Operations like `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `insert`, `remove` should update the structural node and appropriately adjust dependencies (e.g. consumers of indices that shift).\n\n#### Desired semantics for SignalSet<T>\n\n1. **Per-element membership tracking**\n\n   - `set.has(value)` should register a dependency on the membership of that value.\n   - `set.add(value)` / `set.delete(value)` invalidates only consumers that care about that element.\n\n2. **Structural reactivity**\n\n   - `set.size`, `set.values()`, `set.entries()` depend on a structural node.\n   - \n### Example implementation: SignalMap<K, V>\n\nBelow is a **reference implementation** of a `SignalMap<K, V>` built using `@angular/core/primitives/signals`.  \nThis is only a proof of concept, but it illustrates the desired semantics and the kind of functionality that would be useful as a built-in.\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  REACTIVE_NODE,\n  type ReactiveNode,\n  type ValueEqualityFn,\n  defaultEquals,\n  producerAccessed,,\n  producerIncrementEpoch,\n  producerNotifyConsumers,\n} from '@angular/core/primitives/signals';\n\ntype SignalMapEntryNode<V> = ReactiveNode & {\n  value: V;\n  equal: ValueEqualityFn<V>;\n};\n\nexport class SignalMap<K, V> {\n  readonly #entries = new Map<K, SignalMapEntryNode<V>>();\n\n  /**\n   * Global \"structural\" node for the map:\n   * -

need to manage lifecycle of each per-key/element signal (creation, deletion),\n   - need separate structures for structure vs. values,\n   - cannot easily express collections-of-signals in a reusable, composable way.\n- Hand-rolled abstractions on top of @angular/core/primitives/signals\n   Possible (and the example above shows how), but:\n  - everyone has to reinvent essentially the same patterns,\n  - there’s no shared, documented set of best practices for reactive collections,\n  - many teams would prefer a higher-level API similar in ergonomics to signal().\n\n### Additional\n\nWe can think about how to match this with `model()`. Maybe do `modelMap()`... etc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65549","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add reactive collection helpers\" (#65549)"},{"Id":"3654070480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-22T14:10:55","Actor":"hussein-m-kandil","Number":"65541","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix router event subscription in error handler example","State":"closed","Body":"The example incorrectly persisted the error message after a successful navigation retry because the stream only emitted NavigationError events.

I am working on getting an Angular zoneless based testing mount/harness together for Cypress. For the most part, I think the migration outlined in https://angular.dev/guide/zoneless works very well as I was able to play around with what this would look like in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/pull/58/commits/ec6a5fe0c338603d1c33e4073c0eb075d0eef4a0.\n\nAll the other components change detect correctly except the `app.component`, which doesn't appear to rerender after the component has been updated. Is there something I have configured incorrectly on the mentioned commit or is this a bug? I originally thought this might be due to a shallow render / real click events issue but that doesn't seem to be the case. Oddly enough, actually clicking on the button rerenders the component.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/pull/58\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n* clone/fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps\n*  checkout the `chore/angular-zoneless` branch. \n* Change directories into `angular-zoneless` and run `npm install` on at least Node `22.19.0`.\n*  Then, run `npx cypress open`, click component testing -> chrome or electron -> and then click the `app.component.cy.ts`. Notice that the component is not updated after clicking the login button, though the service logic and updates are called in the component.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 21.0.0\nNode: 22.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm@11\nAngular: 21.0.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96fbdeab-ef2c-40fe-babd-fa86997f91e6","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65531","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular zoneless change detection doesn't appear to work correctly inside TestBed/Cypress\" (#65531)"},{"Id":"3652630320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T20:48:42","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"65482","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: format JSON examples and replace <docs-code> with fenced code b…","State":"closed","Body":"…locks\r\n\r\nReplaced <docs-code language=\"json\" header=\".postcssrc.json\"> with fenced JSON code blocks using ```json {header: '.postcssrc.json'} for improved readability and consistency across documentation.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Another user points out that it may be related to \"the sequence of events the CDK sends to it\", but the issue died without any proper investigation.\n\n2. **Fixes attempted**\n  - The FocusMonitor bug #25188 (Jun 2022) where `cdk-program-focused` is incorrectly applied on mouse click was marked as completed\n  - The associated PR #25232 improved focus detection, especially when a label is clicked, but it doesn’t entirely solve the visual persistence issue for all components.\n\n3. **Version testing on the Angular Material doc site**\nAfter checking each latest minor version on the material.angular.dev website: \n- For checkboxes, the issue does not appear in earlier **latest** minor versions (before v15), but is present again from v15 onward (tested in v16, v17… up to v21 RC). A few issues also indicate this bug actually existed in version like v14 but got fixed before the latest minor, hence why I couldn't check it today.\n- For radio buttons, the bug is visible from v11 to v13, was fixed in v14 (see #23807), but was reintroduced somewhen during v15 until today\n\n4. **Accessibility & UX concerns**\n  - The persistent indicator can be confusing: after clicking, the element looks like it’s still “active” or focused, which might not reflect its real state\n  - Most other libraries I've checked fade out ripples after *mouse* click, so this behavior is surprising for people used to other websites\n- According to the CSS `:focus-visible` mechanism, focus indication should ideally reflect input modality (e.g. keyboard vs mouse). The MDN spec explains that `:focus-visible` is designed to show focus rings only when useful (e.g. keyboard navigation), precisely to differentiate when focus indicators should be shown depending on input modality (y'know, on the contrary to `:focus`...).\n- Persistent focus indicators can degrade usability or cause visual noise, especially in complex UI flows (I actually got several bug reports from customers confused by it)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-dqjhk5mq?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Angular Material (e.g. version 15+)\n2. Render a component like `<mat-radio-button>` or `<mat-checkbox>`\n3. Click the element with the mouse\n4. Observe that the ripple or focus ring stays visible after the click completes\n5. Click somewhere else (outside the element) to unfocus and notice how the focus indicator disappears\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After a mouse click, the ripple/focus indicator should fade out (or be removed) even if the component remains focused.\n- The behavior should be consistent across input types: mouse clicks vs keyboard interactions\n- Persistent focus indicators should align with modern focus pseudo-attributes (`:focus` vs `:focus-visible`), showing visible indicators only when needed and not “sticking” unnecessarily after click interactions\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Ripple or focus ring remains on the component after click and only goes away when the component loses focus (when clicking away)\n- This behavior is visible on both checkboxes, radio buttons and actual buttons\n- The bug has appeared, disappeared, and reappeared across versions, suggesting regression or incomplete fix\n\n### Environment\n\nDoesn't really matter that much but here's the linked Stackblitz env.\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Firefox 145.0\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11, macOS 26\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(focus): Persistent focus/ripple indicator stays visible on click\" (#32365)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-23T03:30:02.841193Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2149}

The requirements are:\n1. Structure: backdrop > container > content\n2. The container animation must be longer than the backdrop animation \n3. I need to know when the animations (both enter and leave) have finished\n\n### 1. `animate.leave` doesn't emit animationend\nReferring to the comment (https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/62212#discussioncomment-13595428), the preferred way to react to animation events is now through native browser events. Unfortunately, in the case of `animate.leave`, it seems that neither `animationend` nor `animationcancel` is emitted.\n\n### 2. Nested animations\nI want to add animations to the 'backdrop ' and 'container'. I've tested two ways to achieve my goal:\n1. Nested attributes `animate`\n```\n<backdrop animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n    <container animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n        ...content\n    </container>\n</backdrop>\n```\n2. Nested styles with animation\n```\n<style>\n    backdrop.enter { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.enter > container { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.leave { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.leave > container { animation: ... }\n</style>\n\n<backdrop animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n    <container>\n        ...content\n    </container>\n</backdrop>\n```\n\nIn the first approach, `animate.enter` works correctly, but `animate.leave` for the `container` does not fire at all.\nIn the second attempt, the enter and leave animations for the `container` are interrupted.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how this situation with nested animations should work, but I think the more natural approach is the first one, and the nested 'animate' should also be notified when the parent is destroyed. The question remains whether a nested animation should prevent its parent from being destroyed.\n\nI am aware that I can achieve this with `(animate)` or a second approach with animations of equal duration.\n\n### 3. Class-based animation termination\nAccording to documentation (https://angular.dev/guide/animations#event-bindings-functions-and-third-party-libraries):\n\n> If you don't call animationComplete() when using [animate.leave](https://angular.dev/api/animations/animate#leave), Angular calls the function automatically after a four-second delay.\n\nThis information is incomplete, as animations based on CSS classes also terminate after 4 seconds. This can be misleading, as the documentation suggests that the timeout only serves as a safeguard against a missing call `animationComplete()`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/kyent3r4?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.2.0\nNode: 22.17.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\n\nAngular: 20.2.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2002.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.2.0\n@angular-devkit/core            20.2.0 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.2.0\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.0\n@angular/cli                    20.2.0\n@schematics/angular             20.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"animate.leave doesn't emit animationend, nested animation and timeout docs\" (#63388)"},{"Id":"3353173477","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-25T20:48:34","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"63387","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): wrap `checkNoChanges` body in `if (ngDevMode)` for better tree-shaking","State":"open","Body":"The `checkNoChanges` method previously used an early-return guard:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  if (!ngDevMode) return;\r\n  // dev-only code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn production builds, `ngDevMode` is replaced with `false`, so the guard compiles to `return;`.

Even in production builds, esbuild and other bundlers must keep their factory code because they are referenced with `new Optional()` / `new SkipSelf()`. With `inject()`, those classes are no longer referenced, allowing them and the `makeParamDecorator` scaffolding to be tree-shaken when unused.\r\n\r\nAs a result, production bundles can drop both `Optional`, `SkipSelf`, and their supporting factory code when not used elsewhere, reducing code size while keeping the same behavior.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63386","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): replace Optional/SkipSelf deps with inject() flags\" (#63386)"},{"Id":"3353021203","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-25T19:50:04","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63382","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): Remove Zone-based change provider from internals by default","State":"open","Body":"This change removes the internally provided `ZoneJS`-based change detection scheduler.

I love the idea and simple animations convert across very easily. Single use animations are also simply converted. The new animations are extremely elegant.\n\nI have an issue with more complex re-usable animations though, specifically those that use AUTO_STYLE (I do know about the grid CSS trick).\n\nHere is a simple example of an animation used everywhere in our application. It simply expands an inline element, pushing other inline content to the right as it expands. We have many other animations that also use AUTO_STYLE for them to work.\n\n```\nexport const horizontalExpandAnimation: AnimationTriggerMetadata = trigger('horizontalExpandAnimation', [\n  transition(\n    ':enter',\n    [\n      style({ transform: 'scaleX(0)', width: 0, 'transform-origin': 'left' }),\n      animate('{{ time }} ease-in-out', style({ transform: 'scaleX(100%)', width: AUTO_STYLE }))\n    ],\n    { params: { time: '250ms' } }\n  ),\n  transition(\n    ':leave',\n    [\n      style({ transform: 'scaleX(100%)', 'transform-origin': 'left' }),\n      animate('{{ time }} ease-in-out', style({ transform: 'scaleX(0)', width: 0 }))\n    ],\n    { params: { time: '250ms' } }\n  )\n]);\n```\n\nThis can be replicated using CSS grid with 0fr to 1fr animation. However for this to work, i need two elements - the parent with the grid styling and the content that is being animated.\n\nSo my two options currently are:\n1. Create a component that does the animation. This is a bit messy as now i need to add an additional component that wraps the various many elements that can be expanded.\n2. Implicitly \"know\" that this animation type only works as a direct child of a specific class that i need to apply to the parent element.\n\nBoth of these options are not as elegant as putting `@horizontalExpandAnimation` on the element i want to expand.\n\nMaybe I've missed something here as information is a bit sparse (understandably so as 20.2 is quite young) and the examples everyone provides are simplistic. I'm always happy to be told I'm wrong :)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCould we have an animate.enter and .leave events include a copy of the content that angular is about to render in to the DOM so i can measure it? \nI tried reading `target` in the enter event but this is provided without any children content, so is always width 0. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone that i can think of.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63362","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CSS animations in 20.2 missing key functionality\"

bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHi, we are using one package named @wagmi/connectors in multiple apps, it imports some of its dependencies using dynamic import like this (in some functions): \n```ts\n const { EthereumProvider } = await import('@walletconnect/ethereum-provider')\n```\nAll things works correctly while running app in dev mode. but bundled code has some issues. \none of our app is generating incorrect code while bundling this import.\npossibly invalid code:\n```ts\n   var Nn = class s {\n        constructor() {\n            tt(this, \"events\", new zE.EventEmitter),\n            tt(this, \"namespace\", \"eip155\"),\n            tt(this, \"accounts\", []),\n            tt(this, \"signer\"),\n            tt(this, \"chainId\", 1),\n          // other code\n        }\n        static init(e) {\n            return h(this, null, function*() {\n                let t = new s;\n                return yield t.initialize(e),\n                t\n            })\n        }\n        // ... other code\n      }\n\n// related import code from other chunk:\nlet { EthereumProvider: v } = yield import(\"./chunk-ZPGDBFJA.js\")\n\n```\nvalid generated code (from other app):\n```ts\nvar Ro = class s {\n    constructor() {\n        Ve(this, \"events\", new hl.EventEmitter),\n        Ve(this, \"namespace\", \"eip155\"),\n        Ve(this, \"accounts\", []),\n        Ve(this, \"signer\"),\n        Ve(this, \"chainId\", 1),\n        // other code\n    }\n    static async init(e) {\n        let t = new s;\n        return await t.initialize(e),\n        t\n    }\n    // ... other code\n  }\n// related import code from other chunk:\nlet { EthereumProvider: g } = await import(\"./chunk-3H7TA2LI.js\")\n```\n\nAs you can see working code uses await import and async init fn, while non working version uses yield import and normal init() func,  Both apps are using same Angular version (20.2) and also same imported lib version and same tsconfig. \nnon working version had .browserslistrc before but I have now removed it and tried again multiple times.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\ncurrently none, issue only occurs in some apps/setup.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nyield import('chunk...') returns undefined so imported lib doesn't work in affected app.\nerror:  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'init')\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.2.0\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.2.1\n... animations, common, compiler,

change:** `meta.inspect()` (as well as other systems\n  that use it such as `@debug` and certain error messages) now emits numbers\n  with as high precision as is available instead of rounding to the nearest\n  1e⁻¹⁰ as we do when serializing to CSS. This better fits the purpose of\n  `meta.inspect()`, which is to provide full information about the structure of\n  a Sass value.\n\n- Passing a rest argument (`$arg...`) before a positional or named argument when\n  calling a function or mixin is now deprecated. This was always outside the\n  specified syntax, but it was historically treated the same as passing the rest\n  argument at the end of the argument list whether or not that matched the\n  visual order of the arguments.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, Angular does not include things manually correctly.\n\nFortunately, the Vite's default behavior is easy to get back:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/e899bc7c73a27cdf327875e5d696c50d396a7fc2/packages/vite/src/node/server/index.ts#L1126-L1127\n\nTheir default calls `searchForWorkspaceRoot()`, which is exposed by Vite and can be called manually as documented in https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-allow.\n\nI confirmed that updating the Angular code to the following fixes the issue:\n\n```diff\n- join(serverOptions.workspaceRoot, 'node_modules'),\n+ searchForWorkspaceRoot(serverOptions.workspaceRoot),\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Serve fails to serve node_modules assets in monorepos\" (#31016)"},{"Id":"3346096166","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-22T18:42:06","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31014","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.2.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `d28edf0` -> `3a48544` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `029d16b` -> `cb03391` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `029d16b` -> `cb03391` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

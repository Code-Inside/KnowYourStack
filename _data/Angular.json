I am having an issue with the following code. I posted on stackoverflow and it was suggested this is a bug that I should post here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  authService = inject(AuthService)\r\n\r\n  isLoggedIn$ = new BehaviorSubject<Boolean>(false);\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    console.log('IS INIT');\r\n    this.authService.authStatus().pipe(\r\n      tap( console.log ),\r\n      tap( res => {\r\n          this.isLoggedIn$.next(!!res?.body)\r\n      } )\r\n    ).subscribe(\r\n      () => {},\r\n      ( err ) => {\r\n        console.log( err );\r\n        this.isLoggedIn$.next( false );\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  authStatus(): Observable<HttpResponse<object>> {\r\n    return this.http.get(`${apiUrls.authServiceApi}/status`,\r\n      { observe: 'response', withCredentials: true });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in the template:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n   <ng-container *ngIf=\"!(isLoggedIn$ | async)\">\r\n      <span\r\n        [routerLink]=\"['/login']\"\r\n        routerLinkActive=\"router-link-active\"\r\n        class=\"text-xl cursor-pointer text-gray-200 font-bold m-3 hover:underline hover:text-indigo-200\"\r\n        >Login</span\r\n      >\r\n      <span\r\n        [routerLink]=\"['/register']\"\r\n        routerLinkActive=\"router-link-active\"\r\n        class=\"text-xl cursor-pointer text-gray-200 font-bold m-3 hover:underline hover:text-indigo-200\"\r\n        >Register</span\r\n      >\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the header template is not immediately updated on logging in (logging in correctly saves an httponly cookie, then used to poke the api through the header component). it's only updated after a page refresh to hide the login/register links.\r\n\r\nstackoverflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78096543/monitoring-api-response-from-angular/78099204\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.2\r\n@angular/cli                    17.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54686","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to react to an API response.\" (#54686)"},{"Id":"2167528978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T18:57:20","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54694","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use the right path for first-app images","State":"open","Body":"Before : https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app\r\nAfter : https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-54694-adev-prev-dtghxpbl.web.app/tutorials/first-app\r\n\r\nNotice the image in `Conceptual preview of your first Angular app` was missing.

I have recently migrated to OnPush, and found that setting properties directly on the input (`component.myInput = newValue; fixture.detectChanges()`) does not trigger change detection. Instead, I found two alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. `fixture.componentRef.setInput('myInput', newValue)`\r\n2. `component.myInput = newValue; fixture.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck(); fixture.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\n№ 2 adds boilerplate, and will not work with signals. Therefore № 1 is preferable. However, it does not offer any typesafety.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following type signature for setInput:\r\n\r\n``` ts\r\nabstract class ComponentRef<C> {\r\n  abstract setInput<K extends MutableKeys<C>>(name: K, value: C[K]): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype MutableKeys<T> = {\r\n  [P in keyof T]-?: \r\n    // Check if trying to assign a value to the property P after it's been initialized\r\n    // does not result in a type error (indicating it's mutable). If it's mutable, include the key P.\r\n    // We use a conditional type here, where we try to assign a different type to the property P\r\n    // and check if it's assignable to the original type T. If it is, it means the property is mutable.\r\n    IfEquals<{ [Q in P]: T[P] }, { -readonly [Q in P]: T[P] }, P>\r\n}[keyof T];\r\n\r\n// Utility type to check if two types are exactly the same\r\ntype IfEquals<X, Y, A = X, B = never> = \r\n  (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends \r\n  (<T>() => T extends Y ? 1 : 2) ? A : B;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample usage:\r\n```ts\r\nclass X {\r\n  readonly a = 1;\r\n  b = 2;\r\n  c?: number;\r\n  protected d = 4;\r\n  private e = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare let componentRef: ComponentRef<X>;\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - a is readonly\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"a\", 1);\r\n\r\n// b is mutable\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"b\", 2);\r\n\r\n// c is mutable and optional\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"c\", 3);\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"c\", undefined);\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - d is protected\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"d\", 4);\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - e is protected\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"e\", 5);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Typescript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?ssl=10&ssc=1&pln=12&pc=1#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-Jh0hPJRbQwZ8EAaBAAEYEBsAAmGCFEQ1QEHAyDTBgrI4IQlQMDfVCMKwhBcNo78bH-WcOBQV0EBQtgM2bVsL3mHJ0NnLgQCA7CRKQJpgPEXBLigST4yUeBXi+ICABZFN9ZwlDkICAFZZyiOd2AZDjj20RBBQIYh9SoagbBwGzSHIeyXwYNj2E+AABCAwDqBR4ngALYR9BA6ghZMED44h23YvBCBcygaAJQQRDESQTAAImALKHHQ3xPM+MSoopFJ4ucuyUrS0QJAgbKQDyhjCuiLzOlgcNsVTBIbTtLYRXMZAKsSqrqFSoRasyrLYCagBmFr2GskbXOqiaMvq6amvEW0aBKV4FvnTpfP8wLeggEK4XCtSoqUs7XmG2yVrGmr1uy5QmvUg62oQY6AvkILzphS6IoSG7NmUpQ3kWhLHuS561rq7KSCa-TCqAA)\r\n\r\nOpen points:\r\n\r\n1. support for signals\r\n2. support for aliasing (though it would be acceptable for me to pass the property name rather than the alias)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`component.myInput = newValue; fixture.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck(); fixture.detectChanges()`\r\n\r\n- no support for signals\r\n- extra boilerplate","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54693","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Provide typesafety for ComponentRef.setInput\" (#54693)"},{"Id":"2162557668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T17:55:46","Actor":"CrazyNoobCat","Number":"54668","RawContent":null,"Title":"Learn Angular Tutorial Broken","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe Learn Angular tutorial preview dies everytime the webpage is loaded regardless of computer used. \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/19902080/b1b58f28-a9ba-4da9-a3db-7b63a7a88690)\r\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nWorking tutorial.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nOpening the tutorial\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nPreviously the tutorial worked without any effort.

I created `PrivacyPolicyComponent` and after that I just simply copied it to use it as `CookiesPolicyComponent` (of course I changed name everywhere). After all needed changes I just simply added it to module routing so my two routes for policies looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpath: 'privacy-policy',\r\n\t\tcomponent: PrivacyPolicyComponent,\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpath: 'cookies-policy',\r\n\t\tcomponent: CookiesPolicyComponent,\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked my `https://localhost:4200/privacy-policy` url and it worked fine but `https://localhost:4200/cookies-policy` didn't, so I started looking for problems. I simply opened dev tools to inspect if there are some console errors but there were none. I decided to check DOM if component is there and I found it but when I hoovered it there was nothing to look at (standard tooltip with dimensions were not displayed) in my viewport and I noticed some strange user agent stylesheet added: `display: none !important;`. After that I added some simple console logs in `ngOnInit` and in constructor but nothing happened and I couldn't see it in console.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging I thought that I did some spelling mistake or something strange happened so I decided to just simply generate new component so I did it with Angular CLI and I added it in module routing to my `cookies-policy` route but... nothing has changed and I still couldn't see my component beeing rendered on my route.\r\n\r\nI decided to do some more debugging and I just simply changed places of routes in array etc but still nothing helped to fix it, and then I just used the same component for both routes like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpath: 'privacy-policy',\r\n\t\tcomponent: PrivacyPolicyComponent,\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpath: 'cookies-policy',\r\n\t\tcomponent: PrivacyPolicyComponent,\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and it worked, so my conclusion was: \"Ok, routing works fine so why the heck my newly generated component don't work?\".\r\n\r\nI don't know why but I decided to generate a few components with 'cookie' in name like: `CookiesComponent, CookiesPolicyComponent, CookieComponent, CookiePolicyComponent` and none of these worked, but when I generated component with some random name like `BlahBlahComponent` then it worked fine.\r\n\r\nI also checked it with rendering component with \"cookie\" in name directly in html file like `<app-cookie></app-cookie>` and there is still the same problem - component is not rendered.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: is this feature or bug? And if it is a feature then why?\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.1\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.1\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54675","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Weird behavior with components with 'cookie' in name\" (#54675)"},{"Id":"2164638911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-02T06:27:17","Actor":"damiansire","Number":"54674","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add damian sire to GDE resources","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Instead, loading it dynamically we met an issue.\nWe just update our app from angular 17 to 19 and it worked correctly using the below code:\n```typescript\nconst localeData = await import(`@angular/common/locales/${locale}.mjs`);\n```\nIs there something that i'm not understanding or we met an issue?\n\nHere below, the codes suggested on angular 19  for dynamic localization that reproduce the issue.\nThis example has been created from an angular empty project.\n\n// locale.service.ts\n```typescript\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\nimport en from '@angular/common/locales/en';\n\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class LocaleService {\n  async loadLocale(locale: string): Promise<void> {\n    try {\n      const a = en;\n      console.log(a);\n      const localeData = await import(`@angular/common/locales/${locale}`);\n      registerLocaleData(localeData.default);\n      console.log(`Locale ${locale} loaded!`);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(`Error while loading locale: ${error}`);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n// app.component.ts\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { LocaleService } from '../locale.service';\nimport {DatePipe} from '@angular/common';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `\n

}}</p>\n  `,\n  imports: [\n    DatePipe\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  today = new Date();\n\n  constructor(private localeService: LocaleService) {}\n\n  changeLocale(locale: string) {\n    this.localeService.loadLocale(locale).then(() => {\n      // After loading the locale, Angular will apply the locale formatting automatically.\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n//

were signal equivalents to things like `data`/`paramMap`/`queryParams`/`routerEvents` etc. on the `ActivatedRoute` and `Router`.\n\nCurrently I have to do a lot of this kinda thing:\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nparams = toSignal(this.activatedRoute.paramMap)\nqueryParams = toSignal(this.activatedRouter.queryParamMap)\nuserId = computed(() => this.params()?.get('userId'))\nviewingTab = computed(() => this.queryParams()?.get('tab'))\n```\n\nOr even sometimes something like this (say if I want to read the params of a child route):\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nrouter = inject(Router)\nrouterEvents = toSignal(this.router.events)\nuserId = linkedSignal({\n  source: () => this.routerEvents(),\n  computation: () => this.activatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.paramMap.get('userId')\n})\n```\n\nWhich can get quite annoying and boilerplatey, and I end up with a lot more things being defined that I really want.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBe able to access a signal based values of these. I don't have a strong opinion on the naming of such things I'm just prefixing things with `signal` to illustrate the idea.\n\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute)\nuserId = computed(() => this.activatedRoute.signalParamMap()?.get('userId'))\nviewingTab = computed(() => this.activatedRoute.signalQueryParamMap()?.get('tab'))\n```\n\n```ts\nactivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);\nrouter = inject(Router)\nuserId = linkedSignal({\n  source: () => this.router.signalEvents(),\n  computation: () => this.activatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.paramMap.get('userId')\n})\n```\n\nThis assumes that the signal and observable properties would live next to each other in the existing class.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nHave different injectables eg. `SignalActivatedRoute`/`SignalRouter` or maybe even better would be something like `import {ActivatedRoute, Router} from '@angular/router/signals'` so that then you just need to change your return type.\n\nJust to note that I'm only suggesting these things because they are the ones that I use the most often might be more router related things that could benefit from this that I'm not aware of.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59877","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose signal version of `ActivatedRoute` and `Router` observable class properties\" (#59877)"},{"Id":"2836909876","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-07T00:13:22","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"59876","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): introduce experimental `httpResource`","State":"open","Body":"`httpResource` is a new frontend to the `HttpClient` infrastructure.

The WebGL animation on the home page is completely removed.\r\n2. A new animation processor/player is implemented and added to `adev` web app (`.../app/features/home/animation`) + tests.\r\n3. A new CSS+JS-based animation substitutes the existing WebGL one.\r\n\r\n### 1. Getting rid of the old WebGL animation\r\n\r\nPretty self-explanatory – all of the code has been removed, including the resources like textures and gradients, and more importantly, the external dependencies `ogl` and `gsap`.\r\n\r\n### 2. New animation processor (`Animation`)\r\n\r\nSince I had to replicate the existing WebGL animation with CSS+JS, I created an animation player/processor that uses a simple, similar to CSS `@keyframes`, API. Basically, additionally to setting the `from` and `to` styles, you have the option to specify timing (what we needed in order to replicate the current animation + the finer controls like starting, pausing and seeking): \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst definition: AnimationDefinition = [\r\n  {\r\n    selector: 'element',\r\n    timeframe: [0, 5], // seconds\r\n    from: { /* styles */ },\r\n    to: {/* styles */},\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone capable of writing CSS should be able to create new or alter the existing animation.\r\n\r\nWhat the animation player does is parse the animation definition initially to an internal model. After that it performs calculations (linear change) based on a provided time/timestamp (calculates frames). There is a plugin system that provides scroll control. More information can be found in the [README in the diff](https://github.com/hawkgs/angular/blob/docs/rework-home-page-animation/adev/src/app/features/home/animation/README.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. New CSS+JS-based animation\r\n\r\nThe animation replicates the existing one as closely as possible. Of course, there are some minor discrepancies, some a matter of further fine-tuning, others – caused by HTML/CSS/`Animation` limitations:\r\n\r\n- The gradients of the meteors and \"Build for everyone\" are not animated (the colors don't shift) but I suspect that not many people will notice that.\r\n- The amount of meteors is reduced since they are now HTML elements and animating a large amount of them might cause some lag spikes.\r\n- The amount of meteors is fixed on page load (i.e. resizing the viewport won't render more of them; `Animation` limitation).\r\n- (Plus) The UwU logo is now integrated into the new interactive animation.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nResource-wise there is a decrease by **232 KB** (transferred: **77KB** decrease) on home page load after the removal of the existing animation and the introduction of the new one. The chunk with the the animation player and the home page + animation definition is **38.1KB** (12KB compressed).\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise the execution overhead of the WebGL animation initialization on page load, which was ~**145 ms** (M1 Max), is now gone. It's worth mentioning that these computations happen after FCP.\r\n\r\nThe parsing of the current animation takes **~0.5ms** (M1 Max) and around **~20ms** with a x20 CPU slowdown.\r\n\r\nThe frame update calculations for both the WebGL and CSS animations are cheap to begin with, so the change is insignificant.\r\n\r\n### Potential room for improvements\r\n\r\nIn theory, the CSS parser code and execution could be moved to the build phase of `adev`. Though the improvements will be negligible, so I rather think it will be a micro optimization. Also, with this potential change, we will lose the browser context during animation definition, which is handy in some situations (like the meteor field).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59865","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): replace the WebGL home page animation with a CSS+JS version of it\"

The resource resolves the previous load before its `effect()` reacts to the request change.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the window for this race is small, because the request change in (1) will schedule the effect in (2) immediately. However, it's easier to trigger this sequencing in tests, especially when one resource depends on the output of another.\r\n\r\nTo fix the race condition, the resource impl is refactored to track the request in its state, and ignore resolved values or streams for stale requests.

An error event can be received when defining a callback for `Worker.onerror` but this isn't of much help. The issue only occurs with external dependencies (even if the dependency is unused). In the minimal reproduction example I am using `comlink` but the same happens when importing something from `lodash`. Importing local scripts is working fine though.\nI have tried other major UI libraries like react, svelte and vue that have no problems with the any of the workers (despite the `optimizeDeps` issue with the vite bundler).\n\nProblematic code:\n```ts\nimport * as Comlink from 'comlink'; // even failing when not used further down\n\nconst obj = {\n    test() {\n        console.log(\"hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nonmessage = (message) => {\n    console.log(message.data, \"from worker with import\");\n}\n\nComlink.expose(obj);\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023b5238-7fbb-46f9-89bb-f9df50ac7a29)\n\nLoading the worker script had to be achieved by setting these settings in the `angular.json`:\n```json\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n        ...\n            \"assets\": [\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                \"input\": \"public\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                \"input\": \"node_modules/worker_package/dist\"\n              }\n            ],\n        ...\n        \"serve\": {\n          \"options\": {\n            \"prebundle\": false\n          },\n         ...\n```\nOtherwise I would be stuck with this issue: [https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994)\nI don't know if this would lead to the error condition I am experiencing.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created a repository for reproducing the problem: https://github.com/varfoer/comlink_worker_issues\nThe worker packages is already build there, so you can go ahead and try `npm i` and `npm start` or `npm run dev` in the several folders for the different UI libraries. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.5\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                    19.1.5\n@schematics/angular             19.1.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29574","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Importing packages with workers: workers that import external packages fail silently when called\" (#29574)"},{"Id":"2836437470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-06T20:25:54","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29582","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): also add `server.preTransformRequests`","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/5c1360179cec2f0fad6b2adb4a8e4d6930738976 moved `preTransformRequests` from the `server` to `dev` section.

The tree is now fully expanded.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMatTree's expandAll() should expand all nodes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the first level nodes are expanded.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.2\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTree): expandAll() only expand the first level\" (#30445)"},{"Id":"2829580732","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-04T09:22:44","Actor":"kai1992cool","Number":"30444","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen applying a theme like below:\n\n```\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  // font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n\n  @include mat.theme(\n    (\n      color: (\n        theme-type: light,\n        primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n      ),\n      typography: Roboto,\n      density: 0,\n    )\n  );\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nWithout the commented code in body tag, the `h1 to h6` tags do not have the default font-family.\n\n\n[Stackblitz mat.theme](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1?file=src%2Fstyles.scss)\n\n---\n\nIn the old method we had the `typography-hierarchy`, set this up and it works great:\n\n\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\n    $theme: mat.define-theme(\n      (\n        color: (\n          theme-type: light,\n          primary: mat.$spring-green-palette,\n        ),\n        typography: (\n          plain-family: Roboto,\n          brand-family: Open Sans,\n          bold-weight: 900,\n          medium-weight: 500,\n          regular-weight: 300,\n        ),\n        density: (\n          scale: 0,\n        ),\n      )\n    );\n    body {\n      @include mat.core();\n      @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\n    }\n\n    @include mat.typography-hierarchy($theme);\n\n    html {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n[Stackblitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ktjgmit1-ul8bwde7?file=src%2Fstyles.scss,src%2Fmain.ts)\n\nSo the question is how to define the typography for `h1-h6` with `mat.theme(`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nway to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nno way to configure typography with define-theme\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material:19\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30444","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theming): When creating a theme using `mat.theme(` there is no way to configure typography like how we have with `mat.define-theme`\" (#30444)"},{"Id":"2828749072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T23:09:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30443","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix failing test","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a test that's failing at head.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix failing test\" (#30443)"},{"Id":"2828419177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T20:07:44","Actor":"pcurrivan","Number":"30442","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(MatFormFieldControl): Update \"Creating a Custom Form Field Control\" for Signals","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThis is probably already on your TODO list, but in [this guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control), the first example (\"Form field with custom telephone number input control.\") has a typescript file using Signals and Signal effects, but the rest of the guide does not mention Signals.

Under the hood, the Router calls `document.startViewTransition` but does not make the `ViewTransition` object that is returned from the function available in the public API. This means that skipping a transition with [skipTransition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/skipTransition) or applying and removing styles when the transition is [finished](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/finished) is not possible/difficult.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExpose the `ViewTransition` in some way in the public API. This may not need to be the `ViewTransition` object itself. For example, the different states of the view transition in the react [useViewTransitions](https://github.com/noamr/use-view-transitions/blob/main/src/react-vt.ts#L113) are exposed through `transitionState` and managed internally. To keep things similarly a bit more locked down/hidden, the transition state could be exposed as a `signal` in Angular.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- use timeouts to guess when the transition is finished / update callback is done\r\n- skip transitions by applying CSS class to the HTML which disable the animation and then removing the class before the next transition\r\n- attempt to call `startViewTransition` at the right time without turning on the Router feature","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose the ViewTransition object created during Router navigation\" (#51827)"},{"Id":"1903469549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-19T17:51:14","Actor":"atscott","Number":"51826","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): Remove deprecated setupTestingRouter function","State":"open","Body":"The `setupTestingRouter` function is a factory function for creating a new instance of the `Router`.

Such cases are very difficult to debug as the dev has no clue why the component was not rendered. As bad as this pattern is, fixing all such tools for a better error handling is beyond the scope of our effort. Instead, in this change we print the error messages coming from calculating component dependencies (part of component rendering) to the console for a better visibility into the error. This change only affects local compilation where the component dependencies are calculated in runtime. This change can potentially shed light into many failures of local compilation in g3.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The majority of the changes is around reworking the `R3TargetBinder` to consider `if`, `switch` and `defer` blocks (plus the sub-blocks) as separate embedded views. This allows us to properly resolve references within their scope and is consistent with how they behave at runtime. Split up across the following commits to make it easier to review:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): require a reference in interaction and hover triggers\r\nUpdates the parsing for `interaction` and `hover` triggers to require a reference to an element.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): update binder to account for new semantics\r\nWhen the `TargetBinder` was written, the only embedded-view-based nodes were templates, but now we have `{#if}`, `{#switch}` and `{#defer}` which have similar semantics. These changes rework the binder to account for the new nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): add utility to resolve the deferred block trigger element\r\nAdds a utility to the `BoundTarget` that helps with resolving which element a deferred block is pointing to.

However, when working with server-rendered responses, it introduces a noticeable flickering effect. Here's what happens: when server-side rendering (SSR) is enabled and the client receives a server-rendered markup, the browser starts rendering the page on the client side.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the Angular bundles are downloaded on the client. If we're using the router with `withViewTransitions`, the View Transition is applied. This transition aims to switch from the view painted using the SSR response to the view painted by the client app. Since both views are essentially the same, it results in an unwanted flickering effect. Even with the default cross-fade view transition, we observe the same page fading out and then fading back in, contributing to the flickering issue.\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular 17.0.0-next.4\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51815","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add option to skip the initial view transition to avoid flicker-like appearance of initial content render\" (#51815)"},{"Id":"1900864891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-18T13:37:17","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"51813","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): ensure reactive node constants are considered pure (#…","State":"closed","Body":"This is 16.2.x version of PR #51809\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51813","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): ensure reactive node constants are considered pure (#…\" (#51813)"},{"Id":"1900748189","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-18T13:17:27","Actor":"e-oz","Number":"51812","RawContent":null,"Title":"computed() is not being recomputed when the dependencies are conditional","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nStarting from 17.0.0.next-3:\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-wejrta?devToolsHeight=33&file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nPlease note my comment on line 43.\r\n\r\nIn short, this version works wrong:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nisProcessing = computed(\r\n    () =>\r\n      this.isMutating() || this.isReading() || this.refreshingItems().length > 0\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this works fine:\r\n```ts\r\nisProcessing = computed(() => {\r\n    const isMutating = this.isMutating();\r\n    const isReading = this.isReading();\r\n    const isRefreshing = this.refreshingItems().length > 0;\r\n    return isMutating || isReading || isRefreshing;\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose it's caused by the fact that `this.isReading()` dependency is being removed dynamically from the graph (in the first function).\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-wejrta?devToolsHeight=33&file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nEverything: 17.0.0-next.4 (please see package.json in repro)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51812","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"computed() is not being recomputed when the dependencies are conditional\" (#51812)"},{"Id":"1900607977","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-18T12:42:21","Actor":"devversion","Number":"51809","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): ensure reactive node constants are considered pure","State":"closed","Body":"Currently when ESBuild bundles an application importing from `@angular/core`, the signals library will be discovered during export analysis.

When `files` isn't passed in, we don't hit the file path that sets up the `MockFileSystem`. With these changes I make it so that we always initialize the mock file system.\r\n2.

Create a new standalone project using `ng new reproduction --standalone` (I'm currently using CLI version 16.2.2)\r\n2. In app.config.ts change line 7 to `providers: [provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())]` (or at least add withComponentInputBinding() to provideRouter)\r\n3. add the folder `src/app/components` with the following two files:\r\nparent.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-parent',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet],\r\n  template: `<p>p: {{p}}</p>\r\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet>`,\r\n  styles: []\r\n})\r\nexport default class ParentComponent {\r\n  @Input() p!: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nchild.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input, inject } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-child',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>p: {{p}}<br/>c: {{c}}</p>\r\n    <button (click)=\"changeC()\">Update C only</button><button (click)=\"changeP()\">Update P only</button><button (click)=\"changePC()\">Update P and C</button>`,\r\n  styles: []\r\n})\r\nexport default class ChildComponent {\r\n  @Input() p!: string;\r\n  @Input() c!: string;\r\n\r\n  router = inject(Router);\r\n\r\n  changeC() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([this.p, Math.random()]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changeP() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([Math.random(), this.c]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changePC() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([Math.random(), Math.random()]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. replace the content of app.route.ts with (redirectTo is added for convenience, not required to reproduce the issue):\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':p',\r\n        loadComponent: () => import('./components/parent.component'),\r\n        children: [\r\n            {\r\n                path: ':c',\r\n                loadComponent: () => import('./components/child.component')\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        path: '',\r\n        redirectTo: 'initial/value',\r\n        pathMatch: 'full'\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n5. run `ng serve --open`\r\n\r\nNotice when you click any of the buttons to navigate, ChildComponent gets undefined as a value for `p`, even though it initially got the correct value from the route. Hitting F5 will also cause ChildComponent to get the correct value again.\r\n\r\n**work-around**\r\nIf you are sure that the child component is only rendered when the params are provided, you can rewrite it to this to work around this issue:\r\n```\r\n/// imports and decorator.\r\nexport default class ChildComponent {\r\n    private _p: string = '';\r\n    @Input() \r\n    get p(): string {return this._p; }\r\n    set p(p: string) {\r\n        if(p !== undefined) {\r\n            this._p = p; // avoid setting undefined, keeping the initial value (this is the work around)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // etc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nNode: v18.16.1\r\nNode Version Manager: nvm 1.1.10\r\nOS: Windows 11\r\nAngular: 16.2.0 (only the default packages are required to reproduce)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51800","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component Input Binding gets param as undefined\" (#51800)"},{"Id":"1898457614","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T13:43:02","Actor":"mmu094","Number":"51799","RawContent":null,"Title":"rizqshops.com","State":"closed","Body":"Google Cloud\r\nRizq Cloudness\r\nOverview\r\nSolutions\r\nProducts\r\nPricing\r\nResources\r\nDocs\r\nOverview\r\nGuides\r\nReference\r\nResources\r\nSupport\r\nDiscover\r\nCloud Load Balancing overview\r\nChoose a load balancer\r\nLoad balancer feature comparison\r\nGet started\r\nRoles and permissions\r\nIAM Conditions for forwarding rules\r\nOrganization policy constraints\r\nApplication Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nLoad testing backends\r\nProxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL proxy)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nView metrics\r\nPassthrough Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nProtocol forwarding\r\nSecure\r\nSSL certificates\r\nSSL policies\r\nMutual TLS\r\nCustomize load balancer\r\nAdvanced load balancing optimizations\r\nBackend services\r\nConnection draining\r\nFirewall rules\r\nForwarding rules\r\nHealth checks\r\nInternal DNS names\r\nIPv6 termination\r\nNetwork endpoint groups\r\nProxy-only subnets\r\nTags\r\nTarget pools\r\nTarget proxies\r\nURL maps\r\nOperate and maintain\r\nAudit logging information\r\nHealth check logging information\r\nClean up a load balancer setup\r\nCloud Load Balancing \r\nDocumentation \r\nGuides\r\nWas this helpful?\r\n\r\nSend feedbackOrganization policy constraints for Cloud Load Balancing On this page\r\nRestrict load balancer types\r\nGKE error messages\r\nDisable global load balancing\r\nRestrict protocol forwarding types\r\nEnforce Shared VPC restrictions\r\nRestrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nRestrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nRestrict cross-project backend services\r\n\r\nThis page provides supplemental information about organization policy constraints that apply to Cloud Load Balancing. You use organization policy constraints to enforce settings across an entire project, folder, or organization.\r\n\r\nOrganization policies only apply to new resources. Constraints are not enforced retroactively. If you have pre-existing load-balancing resources that are in violation of a new organization policy, you will need to address such violations manually.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of available constraints, see Organization policy constraints.\r\n\r\nRestrict load balancer types\r\nUse an organization policy to restrict the Cloud Load Balancing types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Load Balancer Types ID:constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes When you set the compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the Cloud Load Balancing types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:\r\n\r\nINTERNAL_TCP_UDP for the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer INTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional internal Application Load Balancer GLOBAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the cross-region internal Application Load Balancer EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP for the external passthrough Network Load Balancer EXTERNAL_TCP_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with a TCP proxy EXTERNAL_SSL_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with an SSL proxy EXTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the classic Application Load Balancer EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional external Application Load Balancer REGIONAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional external proxy Network Load Balancer REGIONAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer GLOBAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the global external Application Load Balancer To include all internal or all external load balancer types, use the in: prefix followed by INTERNAL or EXTERNAL. For example, allowing in:INTERNAL allows all internal load balancers from the preceding list.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nAfter you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing Cloud Load Balancing configurations.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to create a load balancer of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:\r\n\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME of type SCHEME is not allowed.\r\nIf you set multiple restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypesconstraints at different resource levels, they are enforced hierarchically. For this reason, we recommended that you set the inheritFromParent field to true, which ensures that policies at higher layers are also considered.\r\n\r\nGKE error messages\r\nIf you are using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Service and Ingress objects, using this organization policy to restrict load balancer creation results in an error message similar to the following:\r\n\r\nWarning  Sync    28s   loadbalancer-controller  Error during sync: error running\r\nload balancer syncing routine: loadbalancer FORWARDING_RULE_NAME\r\ndoes not exist: googleapi: Error 412:\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes violated for\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID. Forwarding Rule\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/global/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME\r\nof type LOAD_BALANCER_TYPE is not allowed, conditionNotMet\r\nYou can view GKE error messages by running the following commands:\r\n\r\nkubectl get events -w\r\nkubectl describe RESOURCE_KIND NAME\r\nReplace the following:\r\n\r\nRESOURCE_KIND: the kind of load balancer, ingress or service NAME: the name of the load balancer\r\nDisable global load balancing\r\nThis boolean constraint disables creation of global load-balancing products. When enforced, only regional load-balancing products without global dependencies can be created.\r\n\r\n* Name: Disable Global Load Balancing\r\n* ID:constraints/compute.disableGlobalLoadBalancing By default, users are allowed to create global load-balancing products.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict protocol forwarding types\r\nUse an organization policy to restrict the protocol forwarding types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Protocol Forwarding Based on type of IP Address ID:constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes When you set the compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the protocol forwarding types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:\r\n\r\nINTERNAL\r\nEXTERNAL\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nAfter you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing protocol forwarding configurations.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to create a protocol forwarding deployment of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:\r\n\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME of type SCHEME is not allowed.\r\nIf you set multiple restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraints at different resource levels, and if you set the inheritFromParent field to true, then the constraints are enforced hierarchically.\r\n\r\nEnforce Shared VPC restrictions\r\nUse the following organization policies to restrict how users are allowed to set up Shared VPC deployments.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nThis list constraint lets you restrict the Shared VPC host projects that a resource can attach to.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjects By default, a project can attach to any host project in the same organization, thereby becoming a service project. When you set thecompute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjectsconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of host projects in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify a project in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID\r\nSpecify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all projects under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nThis list constraint defines the set of Shared VPC subnets that eligible resources can use. This constraint does not apply to resources within the same project.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks By default, eligible resources can use any Shared VPC subnet. When you set the compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworksconstraint, you specify a restricted list of subnets in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify a subnet in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME. Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all subnets under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nunder:projects/PROJECT_ID\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict cross-project backend services\r\nNote: This constraint only applies to Shared VPC deployments that use cross-project service referencing. Currently, cross-project service referencing is only supported by internal Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers. You can use this constraint to limit the backend services that a URL map can reference. This constraint does not apply to backend services within the same project as the URL map.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict cross-project backend services\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcBackendServices By default, URL maps in all host or service projects can reference compatible backend services from other service projects or the host project in the same Shared VPC deployment as long as the user performing the action has thecompute.backendServices.usepermission. When you set therestrictSharedVpcBackendServicesconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of backend services in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify backend services in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/backendServices/BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all backend services under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nunder:projects/PROJECT_ID\r\nAfter you set up an organization policy with this constraint, the constraint goes into effect the next time you use the gcloud compute url-maps command to attach a backend service to a URL map. The constraint does not retroactively affect existing references to any cross-project backend services.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC project lien removal\r\nThis boolean constraint restricts the set of users that can remove a Shared VPC host project lien without organization-level permission where this constraint is already set to True.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC project lien removal\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval By default, any user with the permission to update liens can remove a Shared VPC host project lien. Enforcing this constraint requires that permission be granted at the organization level.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nSet up boolean constraints with organization policies Permissions required for this task\r\nConsolegcloud\r\nTo set an organization policy from the console, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nIn the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page.

The initial implementation is still experimental and lacks a lot of features, but it is sufficient to run tests generated by `ng new`.\r\n\r\nThere's no docs or setup instructions yet, however the main path to trying this out is to replace `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in `angular.json`. Since Web Test Runner is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Karma, options should mostly align. Currently only a couple options are actually supported right now, but more will be added over time.\r\n\r\nThe commit messages go more in detail on the implementation. In particular, Web Test Runner integration is done via a custom HTML page which explicitly loads the user's JavaScript in a very particular order. This allows our custom Jasmine integration, sets up Zone.js to patch those symbols correctly, configures `TestBed`, and then runs the user's tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently some unrelated unit tests appear to be failing due to Web Test Runner pulling in `@types/mocha` which is conflicting with `@types/jasmine`.

The process to configure and enable the i18n system is the same as with the Webpack-based `browser` builder. The implementation uses a similar approach to the `browser` builder in which the application is built once and then post-processed for each active locale. In addition to inlining translations, the locale identifier is injected and the locale specific data is added to the applications. Currently, this implementation adds all the locale specific data to each application during the initial building. While this may cause a small increase in the polyfills bundle (locale data is very small in size), it has a benefit of faster builds and a significantly less complicated build process. Additional size optimizations to the data itself are also being considered to even further reduce impact. Also, with the eventual shift towards the standard `Intl` web APIs, the need for the locale data will become obsolete in addition to the build time code necessary to add it to the application.\r\nWhile build capabilities are functional, there are several areas which have not yet been fully implemented but will be in future changes. These include console progress information, efficient watch support, and app-shell/service worker support.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25859","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder\" (#25859)"},{"Id":"1898864251","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T20:12:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25858","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis is to align with the `serviceWorker` option.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25858","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option\" (#25858)"},{"Id":"1898129588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T19:01:36","Actor":"Athorcis","Number":"25852","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): fix recursion in webpack resolve","State":"closed","Body":"fix a recursion in webpack resolve when resolving absolute paths on windows\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

That included identifiers such as `none` which have special meaning in CSS, and which should not be treated as custom local identifiers. This release fixes this bug:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    ul { list-style-type: none }\n\n    /* Old output (with --loader=local-css) */\n    ul {\n      list-style-type: stdin_none;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --loader=local-css) */\n    ul {\n      list-style-type: none;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that this bug only affected code using the `local-css` loader. It did not affect code using the `css` loader.\n\n-   Avoid inserting temporary variables before `use strict` ([#&#8203;3322](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3322))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild could incorrectly insert automatically-generated temporary variables before `use strict` directives:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function foo() {\n      'use strict'\n      a.b?.c()\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    function foo() {\n      var _a;\n      \"use strict\";\n      (_a = a.b) == null ? void 0 : _a.c();\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    function foo() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      var _a;\n      (_a = a.b) == null ? void 0 : _a.c();\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Adjust TypeScript `enum` output to better approximate `tsc` ([#&#8203;3329](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3329))\n\n    TypeScript enum values can be either number literals or string literals. Numbers create a bidirectional mapping between the name and the value but strings only create a unidirectional mapping from the name to the value. When the enum value is neither a number literal nor a string literal, TypeScript and esbuild both default to treating it as a number:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    declare const foo: any\n    enum Foo {\n      NUMBER = 1,\n      STRING = 'a',\n      OTHER = foo,\n    }\n\n    // Compiled JavaScript code (from \"tsc\")\n    var Foo;\n    (function (Foo) {\n      Foo[Foo[\"NUMBER\"] = 1] = \"NUMBER\";\n      Foo[\"STRING\"] = \"a\";\n      Foo[Foo[\"OTHER\"] = foo] = \"OTHER\";\n    })(Foo || (Foo = {}));\n    ```\n\n    However, TypeScript does constant folding slightly differently than esbuild. For example, it may consider template literals to be string literals in some cases:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    declare const foo = 'foo'\n    enum Foo {\n      PRESENT = `${foo}`,\n      MISSING = `${bar}`,\n    }\n\n    // Compiled JavaScript code (from \"tsc\")\n    var Foo;\n    (function (Foo) {\n      Foo[\"PRESENT\"] = \"foo\";\n      Foo[Foo[\"MISSING\"] = `${bar}`] = \"MISSING\";\n    })(Foo || (Foo = {}));\n    ```\n\n    The template literal initializer for `PRESENT` is treated as a string while the template literal initializer for `MISSING` is treated as a number. Previously esbuild treated both of these cases as a number but starting with this release, esbuild will now treat both of these cases as a string. This doesn't exactly match the behavior of `tsc` but in the case where the behavior diverges `tsc` reports a compile error, so this seems like acceptible behavior for esbuild. Note that handling these cases completely correctly would require esbuild to parse type declarations (see the `declare` keyword), which esbuild deliberately doesn't do.\n\n-   Ignore case in CSS in more places ([#&#8203;3316](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3316))\n\n    This release makes esbuild's CSS support more case-agnostic, which better matches how browsers work. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo { From { OpaCity: 0 } To { OpaCity: 1 } }\n    body { CoLoR: YeLLoW }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo{From {OpaCity: 0} To {OpaCity: 1}}body{CoLoR:YeLLoW}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo{0%{OpaCity:0}To{OpaCity:1}}body{CoLoR:#ff0}\n    ```\n\n    Please never actually write code like this.\n\n-   Improve the error message for `null` entries in `exports` ([#&#8203;3377](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3377))\n\n    Package authors can disable package export paths with the `exports` map in `package.json`. With this release, esbuild now has a clearer error message that points to the `null` token in `package.json` itself instead of to the surrounding context. Here is an example of the new error message:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"msw/browser\"\n\n            lib/msw-config.ts:2:28:\n              2 │ import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser';\n                ╵                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          The path \"./browser\" cannot be imported from package \"msw\" because it was explicitly disabled by\n          the package author here:\n\n            node_modules/msw/package.json:17:14:\n              17 │       \"node\": null,\n                 ╵               ~~~~\n\n          You can mark the path \"msw/browser\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove\n          this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n\n-   Parse and print the `with` keyword in `import` statements\n\n    JavaScript was going to have a feature called \"import assertions\" that adds an `assert` keyword to `import` statements. It looked like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import stuff from './stuff.json' assert { type: 'json' }\n    ```\n\n    The feature provided a way to assert that the imported file is of a certain type (but was not allowed to affect how the import is interpreted, even though that's how everyone expected it to behave). The feature was fully specified and then actually implemented and shipped in Chrome before the people behind the feature realized that they should allow it to affect how the import is interpreted after all. So import assertions are no longer going to be added to the language.\n\n    Instead, the [current proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes) is to add a feature called \"import attributes\" instead that adds a `with` keyword to import statements. It looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import stuff from './stuff.json' with { type: 'json' }\n    ```\n\n    This feature provides a way to affect how the import is interpreted. With this release, esbuild now has preliminary support for parsing and printing this new `with` keyword. The `with` keyword is not yet interpreted by esbuild, however, so bundling code with it will generate a build error. All this release does is allow you to use esbuild to process code containing it (such as removing types from TypeScript code). Note that this syntax is not yet a part of JavaScript and may be removed or altered in the future if the specification changes (which it already has once, as described above). If that happens, esbuild reserves the right to remove or alter its support for this syntax too.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.67.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1670)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.66.1...1.67.0)\n\n-   All functions defined in CSS Values and Units 4 are now once again parsed as\n    calculation objects: `round()`, `mod()`, `rem()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`,\n    `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`, `hypot()`,\n    `log()`, `exp()`, `abs()`, and `sign()`.\n\n    Unlike in 1.65.0, function calls are *not* locked into being parsed as\n    calculations or plain Sass functions at parse-time. This means that\n    user-defined functions will take precedence over CSS calculations of the same\n    name. Although the function names `calc()` and `clamp()` are still forbidden,\n    users may continue to freely define functions whose names overlap with other\n    CSS calculations (including `abs()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `round()` whose\n    names overlap with global Sass functions).\n\n-   As a consequence of the change in calculation parsing described above,\n    calculation functions containing interpolation are now parsed more strictly\n    than before. However, all interpolations that would have produced valid CSS\n    will continue to work, so this is not considered a breaking change.\n\n-   Interpolations in calculation functions that aren't used in a position that\n    could also have a normal calculation value are now deprecated. For example,\n    `calc(1px #{\"+ 2px\"})` is deprecated, but `calc(1px + #{\"2px\"})` is still\n    allowed. This deprecation is named `calc-interp`. See [the Sass website] for\n    more information.\n\n    [the Sass website]: https://sass-lang.com/d/calc-interp\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix**: The importer used to load a given file is no\n    longer used to load absolute URLs that appear in that file. This was\n    unintented behavior that contradicted the Sass specification. Absolute URLs\n    will now correctly be loaded only from the global importer list. This applies\n    to the modern JS API, the Dart API, and the embedded protocol.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Substantially improve the embedded compiler's performance when compiling many\n    files or files that require many importer or function call round-trips with\n    the embedded host.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

So I use simple the `cdkDrag` directive like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"test\">\r\n  <div class=\"example-box\" cdkDrag>Drag me around</div>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <!-- Copyright 2019 Google LLC.

So its content is scrollable. If I now drag the object and while I dragging I scroll the page, too (with mousewheel as example) the position of the object gets wrong - the object scrolls with the container so to say.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-hv5vd8-qca8ht?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-drag-drop-overview-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nUse a `div` with only `cdkDrag` directive in a scrollable container (or main page)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe object will hold her position under the mouse. So it should not scrolling with the parent container.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe position of the object holds the position of the viewport.

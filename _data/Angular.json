— the field is still editable even though it should be disabled.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe password input field should be disabled and not accept any input after calling the disabled() method.\n\nActual Behavior\n\nThe password input remains editable.\nInspecting the DOM shows that the attribute is rendered as disable instead of disabled.\n\nEnvironment\n\nAngular version:

interoperability standard for Angular, React, and other SPAs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAs modern enterprises increasingly go through mergers and acquisitions, integrating UI applications built with different SPA frameworks (e.g., Angular, React, Vue) has become a frequent challenge.\n\nIn such scenarios, the acquiring company and the acquired company often use different front-end stacks, and the immediate business goal is to integrate both applications quickly—usually before backend systems are merged. This is done to give customers a unified experience under a single domain and accelerate go-to-market objectives.\n\nHowever, when these applications are built using different frameworks, ensuring runtime stability, routing consistency, and isolation becomes extremely difficult.\n\nThis is particularly important for Angular-based applications, since React is currently the most widely used SPA framework. As a result, Angular applications are more likely to need to coexist with React apps during integration phases. Angular developers face the dual challenge of integrating quickly while guaranteeing that Angular code cannot, under any circumstance, destabilize the parent React application.\n\nCurrently, there is no standard or official contract that defines how multiple SPA frameworks can safely run together within the same browser window or page. This lack of guidance leads to uncertainty, trial-and-error approaches, and potential instability in production environments.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose that the Angular team define, document, and implement an official interop contract for running Angular alongside other SPA frameworks—especially React—in the same browser instance.\n\nThis initiative could focus on establishing clear stability guarantees and best practices for framework coexistence, potentially serving as the foundation for a broader industry-wide standard.\n\nKey areas to address:\n\nRuntime stability: Ensure Angular and React can operate concurrently without global side effects or conflicts (e.g., DOM events, polyfills).\n\nRouter isolation and synchronization: Define how both frameworks can manage or isolate routing and browser history state cleanly.\n\nContext sharing: Establish safe and standardized ways to share context (e.g., user session, theme, i18n) between frameworks.\n\nSandbox boundaries: Clarify how Angular’s internals—signals, change detection, styles—can be sandboxed or encapsulated when coexisting with other frameworks.\n\nInterop checklist: Provide a checklist or diagnostic tool to validate a safe integration setup.\n\nReference architecture: Publish a working sample or starter template demonstrating React–Angular coexistence using best practices.\n\nI am willing to contribute engineering effort from my company to collaborate on this feature, should the Angular team choose to lead this effort.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nYes, several approaches exist, but none fully solve the interop or stability challenges:\n\n- Web Components – Provide DOM and style encapsulation but no runtime isolation. Framework-level conflicts (e.g., routing, context) still occur.\n\n- Micro-frontend frameworks (e.g., Module Federation, single-spa) – Enable framework integration, but without guarantees around stability or isolation.\n\n- Zoneless Angular with Signals – Promising in reducing reactivity overhead, but lacks a formalized interop contract with other SPAs.\n\n- Full rewrite to React – Sometimes considered for compatibility, but this is costly, time-consuming, and unnecessary if Angular could safely coexist.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Establish and implement a cross-framework interoperability standard for Angular, React, and other SPAs\" (#64378)"},{"Id":"3508762302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-13T07:13:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"64377","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (20.3.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Accordingly, the `coverageAll` option has been removed from the unit-test builders schema and its usage has been removed from the Karma and Vitest test runner implementations.\r\n- The browser provider mechanism has been updated. Vitest now uses provider-specific packages (e.g., `@vitest/browser-playwright`) instead of the general `@vitest/browser` package. The browser configuration setup has been made asynchronous and now dynamically loads the appropriate provider.\r\n- A workaround has been added to filter non-string values from the resolved coverage exclude patterns.

Building tests fails if you launch ng test with a full POSIX path on Windows:\n```\nng test --browsers Chromium --include \"/c/client/src/app/header/header.component.spec.ts\"\n```\n\nSince the native Windows path is not working, you can't use ${file} in launch.json of Visual Studio Code. Similarly, the full POSIX path ${command:extension.commandvariable.file.filePosix}\" is not working either. This prevents the launching of the current test file on Windows.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nReproduced with 21.0.0-next.7\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your

This would enable more nuanced control than the current `cdkDragBoundary`, which enforces containment uniformly on all sides.\n\n**Proposed API (example):**\n\n<img width=\"712\" height=\"229\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4c3a6da-599b-4b00-82d1-4441d378fbec\" />\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n**1. MatDialog Handle Visibility Constraint**\nEnable users to drag a MatDialog freely within a grid layout, but restrict movement beyond the top and left/right edges of the viewport to ensure the dialog’s drag handle remains visible and accessible. This prevents scenarios where users accidentally drag the dialog off-screen, making it difficult or impossible to reposition without refreshing the page or resetting the layout.\n\n- Preserves usability by keeping the drag handle within reach.\n\n- Prevents frustration from dialogs becoming “lost” off-screen.\n\n- Supports responsive design by adapting to dynamic viewport sizes.\n\n**2. Dashboard Layout Editors**\nAllow users to drag widgets freely within a grid but prevent them from overlapping fixed headers or sidebars. For example:\n\n- Restrict dragging above the top edge to preserve a sticky toolbar.\n\n- Allow overflow on the bottom for expandable panels.\n\n**3. Mobile UI Builders**\nIn mobile layout editors, you might want to:\n\n- Prevent dragging past the left/right edges to maintain responsive design.\n\n- Allow vertical overflow for scrollable content zones.\n\n**4. Game Interfaces**\nIn drag-based puzzle or strategy games:\n\n- Restrict dragging outside the playfield on specific sides (e.g., prevent dragging off the top to simulate gravity).\n\n- Allow dragging into inventory zones only from certain directions.\n\n**5.

In particular, the styling of those pages make it difficult to identify individual methods, and to understand which information to associate with which method. (Context: I just spent a fair amount of time debugging something related to `flexibleDimensions` on the CDKOverlay, and better/more easily intelligible docs would have definitely helped.)\n\nMy suggestion is to make simple tweaks to your styles that emphasize the boundaries between relevant units of functionality (e.g. method, class, etc), rather than using CSS borders to separate the key/label and value/description in bit of documentation about the unit of functionality. \n\nHere's an example of what I am talking about -- the first screenshot is the page now, and the second is what happens if you give the table for each method its own background color and border, and remove the inner borders. (3 CSS property change)\n\nAll of a sudden users can actually distinguish the individual methods, and you can also see that there is no documentation for `detach`. \n\nLots more could be done with spacing, color, and typography, but this is intended as either a quick win/low-hanging fruit suggestion, or more realistically, an issue to add to your evidence pile that the docs could use some redesign with an eye towards information hierarchy in a future release. \n\n<img width=\"987\" height=\"1204\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee3ad02-01e3-40e7-bd29-2b3b87715ced\" />\n---\n<img width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b3b2e3-fc05-44f3-927a-8fe411336d81\" />\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nall pages","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(all): Improvement suggestion: style docs to emphasize integrity of each method\" (#32060)"},{"Id":"3503838837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:59","Actor":"up81tr1222-cpu","Number":"32054","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nTimtonUploadEnhancements.jsx\n\n### Description\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"@/components/TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-6\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nnpx create-react-app timton-upload\ncd timton-upload\nnpm start\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"./TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32054","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#32054)"},{"Id":"3503837866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:54","Actor":"up81tr1222-cpu","Number":"32053","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nTimtonUploadEnhancements.jsx\n\n### Description\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"@/components/TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-6\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nnpx create-react-app timton-upload\ncd timton-upload\nnpm start\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"./TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32053","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#32053)"},{"Id":"3503769927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:36","Actor":"olfek","Number":"32052","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): Inline badges","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAdd support for inline badges like in:\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/badge/#background-colors\n\nThere is no inline option:\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/badge/api#MatBadgePosition\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32052","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(COMPONENT): Inline badges\" (#32052)"},{"Id":"3502263713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T15:38:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32050","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): add interface for timepicker input","State":"closed","Body":"Adds an interface for the timepicker input so that users can provide their own if they want.

Specifically, using @angular/material@20.2.7, MatDrawer has changed from not having an animation to having it multiple times:\n\n- Did not have animation at some point before 06/10/2025 (don't remember the exact date, in this case with @angular/material@20.2.5)\n- Had an animation at 06/10/2025, 9:50 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.5 or @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did not have an animation at 08/10/2025, 11:48 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did have an animation at 10/10/2025, 12:19 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n\nI have also observed these changes in the examples in [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples), which have suffered the same changes in animations in the same dates, but I cannot assure they have not changed the @angular/material version used.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- Create an Angular application that uses MatDrawer, install dependencies just once, and check how the drawer changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates.\n- Or check how [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples) changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates (in some cases without a release).\n\nI know this is not easy to check if nobody else has noticed and it does not happen in the future (that would be fine).

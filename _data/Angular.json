(then it shouldn't be a GET request 😉) )\r\n  - B.3. emit cached response + new request (e.g. in SSG cases, we might want to fetch fresh data in case SSG-ed is not up-to-date).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIMO, not all of these use cases should be handled by Angular's hydration's HTTP cache transfer.\r\n\r\nAllowing per-request opt-out would be enough to let developers customize the behavior for unconventional requests using `TransferState`.\r\n\r\nThis could be done globally using a feature:\r\n```ts\r\nprovideClientHydration(withHttpTransferCache({filter: req => !req.url.startsWith('https://internal')}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand per request\r\n```ts\r\nhttp.get('/my-ip-address', {cacheTransfer: false}); // we'll have to figure out a better naming for this\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDisable the feature using `withNoHttpTransferCache()` and implement our own transfer logic like before using `TransferState`.\r\n\r\nRight now, we can easily mimic the current behavior which is here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/47c093a7391e550bfb01cff57a6fc712f3342d14/packages/common/http/src/transfer_cache.ts#L35-L90\r\n\r\nThe modularity of the current design (thanks to the `TransferState` primitive) and the workaround described here is sufficient enough to reduce the priority of this issue drastically...\r\n\r\n👉 ... making it an interesting opportunity for a community initiative 😉😉 👈","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of Hydration's HTTP Cache Transfer \" (#50117)"},{"Id":"1693180479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T22:34:26","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50116","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove unused deps","State":"open","Body":"* All `@types` package removed have typings in their package.\r\n* brotli is unused\r\n* tmp is unused\r\n* vlq is unused\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50116","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove unused deps\" (#50116)"},{"Id":"1693104476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T21:08:21","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50115","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(elements): remove deps webcomponents/custom-elements.","State":"open","Body":"`webcomponents/custom-elements` is unnecessary now that we support only evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(elements): remove deps webcomponents/custom-elements.\" (#50115)"},{"Id":"1693019847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T19:57:55","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50114","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Remove unused annotation template","State":"open","Body":"This page is unused since v7.\r\n\r\n`@annotation` generates warnings when build the doc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50114","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): Remove unused annotation template\" (#50114)"},{"Id":"1692867023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T18:06:16","Actor":"Lorti","Number":"50113","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add missing navigation item","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

(jdufresne)\n-   Fixed `location.hash = \"\"` to leave any `#` in location.href.\n-   Fixes a few bugs with CSS parsing by replacing `cssom` with `rweb-cssom`, since the latter is maintained.

Reactive Form is used. FormBuilder and FormGroup was used to create formcontrols.\r\n2. After upgrade, All material imports was updated to legacy option. (Example - MatButtonLegacy)\r\n3. In angular v10, Two-way data binding ([(ngModel)]) has been used to bind the id of the selected option, it worked fine.\r\n4. But in v15 we have tried by removing the ngModel, still not fixed.\r\n5. Have tired with [(value)] way of binding, that too didn't give a hand.\r\n6. This is not a multiple select.\r\n7. We have used exact code mentioned below in angular v10 and its not working in angular v15. Find the sample example here - https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-form\r\n\r\n**Support Needed**\r\n1. Angular support team to provide a solution to fix the issue in Mat-Select drop down.\r\n2. To provide if any code changes or import level changes has to be done.\r\n3. We have tested with angular v15.2.4 and material version as v12.2.13, all seems fine.\r\n4. Is it fine to have a downgraded material version with  higher angular version?.\r\n5. **Kindly respond whether it is a good standard to have Angular v15.2.4 and material v12.2.13 as part of production release or provide an fix for the issue in the upgraded versions for both angular and material v15.2.4.**\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly refer the below attachment which shows actual issue in the dropdown after selecting an option, the field is blank;\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"696\" alt=\"b4bc512e-f815-4e50-b949-c68a2370b082\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62600471/235129808-52abe281-fb86-475d-b6e5-b3e0698e7519.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

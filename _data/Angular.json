It's not a regression for our code base.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a standalone directive in a library uses `@Input({ transform: ..})`, the compiler output is broken such that the class isn't recognized as a directive, resulting in errors like those listed in the next section, which state that the class is missing an Angular decorator (which is clearly wrong - it has the `@Directive` decorator).\r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced by:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/johncrim/bug-ng16-input-transform\r\nyarn\r\nyarn build:all\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compile error is:\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBuilding entry point 'ui-components/sticky'\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n✖ Compiling with Angular sources in Ivy partial compilation mode.\r\nlibs/ui-components/sticky/src/Sticky.component.ts:10:5 - error NG2012: Component imports must be standalone components, directives, pipes, or must be NgModules.\r\n\r\n10     MirrorWidthDirective\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is caused by the use of `@Input({transform: ...})` in `MirrorWidthDirective`. The problem is that the use of the input transform feature breaks the build output: The contents of `dist\\ui-components\\fesm2022\\ui-components-mirror-size.mjs` show that `class MirrorWidthDirective` is missing the static `ɵdir` and `ɵfac` properties:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet MirrorWidthDirective = class MirrorWidthDirective {\r\n  // ... (class properties and methods)\r\n};\r\n__decorate([\r\n    Input({ alias: 'ui-mirror-width', required: true, transform: coerceElement })\r\n], MirrorWidthDirective.prototype, \"source\", void 0);\r\nMirrorWidthDirective = __decorate([\r\n    Directive({\r\n        selector: '[ui-mirror-width]',\r\n        standalone: true,\r\n        exportAs: 'ui-mirror-width'\r\n    })\r\n], MirrorWidthDirective);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe similar directive `MirrorHeightDirective` is equivalent but omits use of the `@Input transform`. It is in the same project, but the compiler output (in `dist\\ui-components\\fesm2022\\ui-components-mirror-size.mjs`) is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass MirrorHeightDirective {\r\n  // ...

projectable nodes is to set them in one of the createComponent variants (ViewContainerRef.createComponent, createComponent ... ).\r\n\r\nThe Problem with this approach is that it is not possible to get the injection hierarchy right when multiple nested components are created dynamically ( Example:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xh1j19?file=src%2Fmain.ts) \r\n\r\nSo reproducing the following scenario dynamically is not possible\r\n```\r\n<cmp1>\r\n  <cmp2/>\r\n</cmp1>\r\n```\r\nthe best we can do is \r\n```\r\nconst cmp2 = viewContainerRef.createComponent(Cmp2, /* { injector: NEED_INJECTOR_OF_CMP1_HERE } */ );\r\nconst cmp1 = viewContainerRef.createComponent(Cmp1, { projectableNodes: [[cmp2.location.nativeElement]]});\r\n```\r\nbut this is a problem if CMP1 has component providers!\r\n\r\nTo get the same injection hierarchy as with the declarative approach we would need something like\r\n```\r\nconst cmp1 = viewContainerRef.createComponent(Cmp1);\r\nconst cmp2 = viewContainerRef.createComponent(Cmp2, { injector: cmp1.injector } );\r\ncmp1.setProjectableNodes([[cmp2.location.nativeElement]]);\r\n```\r\nso something like **ComponentRef.setProjectableNodes** is

This would involve creating a built-in mechanism that can analyze the project's file structure and identify files that do not have associated `spec.ts` files. The tool should offer configuration options to customize the file extensions to check, define exclusions, and set exclusion rules based on content.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed solution suggests integrating `jest-angular-test-verifier` directly into Angular CLI, an alternative approach could involve developing a dedicated and more sophisticated solution tailored to Angular projects. By leveraging the power and familiarity of Angular's codebase, the CLI team could create an integrated tool that offers more advanced features and optimizations for detecting missing `spec.ts` files. This approach could lead to a more seamless and tightly integrated experience for Angular developers.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your consideration of this feature proposal and look forward to the possibility of seeing this enhancement added to Angular CLI.

The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI was running testing an angular buildable library using Storybook and Cypress.  I wanted coverage for my cypress tests but my coverage was thrown off because my source maps were partially compiled (e.g. decorators) so my line numbers were off. See [this issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/21171) for a repro and more details.  I looked at the webpack config that was used to build storybook and noticed that AngularWebpackPlugin had `complierOptions.sourceMap = false` which was overriding my tsconfig which had `sourceMap = true`.  I set `sourceMap = true` in the webpack config at runtime and my source maps worked as expected.  I found the culprit in your source code [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c3c4853d4d908025e2f9f0d32419f11459021bff/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/plugins/typescript.ts#L22C45-L22C45) and was wondering why you are explicitly setting these values and not letting tsconfig be the source of truth?  Is this a bug?  \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThere is a repro in the referenced issue above.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nThere are no errors just unexpected behavior.\n```\n\n\n### Your

Type selectors may now be used with CSS nesting:\n\n    ```css\n    .foo {\n      div {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously this was disallowed in the CSS specification because it's ambiguous whether an identifier is a declaration or a nested rule starting with a type selector without requiring unbounded lookahead in the parser. It has now been allowed because the CSS working group has decided that requiring unbounded lookahead is acceptable after all.\n\n    Note that this change means esbuild no longer considers any existing browser to support CSS nesting since none of the existing browsers support this new syntax. CSS nesting will now always be transformed when targeting a browser. This situation will change in the future as browsers add support for this new syntax.\n\n-   Fix a scope-related bug with `--drop-labels=` ([#&#8203;3311](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3311))\n\n    The recently-released `--drop-labels=` feature previously had a bug where esbuild's internal scope stack wasn't being restored properly when a statement with a label was dropped. This could manifest as a tree-shaking issue, although it's possible that this could have also been causing other subtle problems too. The bug has been fixed in this release.\n\n-   Make renamed CSS names unique across entry points ([#&#8203;3295](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3295))\n\n    Previously esbuild's generated names for local names in CSS were only unique within a given entry point (or across all entry points when code splitting was enabled). That meant that building multiple entry points with esbuild could result in local names being renamed to the same identifier even when those entry points were built simultaneously within a single esbuild API call. This problem was especially likely to happen with minification enabled. With this release, esbuild will now avoid renaming local names from two separate entry points to the same name if those entry points were built with a single esbuild API call, even when code splitting is disabled.\n\n-   Fix CSS ordering bug with `@layer` before `@import`\n\n    CSS lets you put `@layer` rules before `@import` rules to define the order of layers in a stylesheet. Previously esbuild's CSS bundler incorrectly ordered these after the imported files because before the introduction of cascade layers to CSS, imported files could be bundled by removing the `@import` rules and then joining files together in the right order. But with `@layer`, CSS files may now need to be split apart into multiple pieces in the bundle. For example:\n\n        /* Original code */\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;import \"data:text/css,@&#8203;layer inner.start;\";\n        @&#8203;import \"data:text/css,@&#8203;layer inner.end;\";\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n        /* Old output (with --bundle) */\n        @&#8203;layer inner.start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.end;\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n        /* New output (with --bundle) */\n        @&#8203;layer start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.start;\n        @&#8203;layer inner.end;\n        @&#8203;layer end;\n\n-   Unwrap nested duplicate `@media` rules ([#&#8203;3226](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3226))\n\n    With this release, esbuild's CSS minifier will now automatically unwrap duplicate nested `@media` rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      .foo { color: red }\n      @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px) {\n        .bar { color: blue }\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.foo{color:red}@&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.bar{color:#&#8203;00f}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;media (min-width: 1024px){.foo{color:red}.bar{color:#&#8203;00f}}\n    ```\n\n    These rules are unlikely to be authored manually but may result from using frameworks such as Tailwind to generate CSS.\n\n### [`v0.19.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0191)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1)\n\n-   Fix a regression with `baseURL` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3307](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3307))\n\n    The previous release moved `tsconfig.json` path resolution before `--packages=external` checks to allow the [`paths` field](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) in `tsconfig.json` to avoid a package being marked as external. However, that reordering accidentally broke the behavior of the `baseURL` field from `tsconfig.json`. This release moves these path resolution rules around again in an attempt to allow both of these cases to work.\n\n-   Parse TypeScript type arguments for JavaScript decorators ([#&#8203;3308](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3308))\n\n    When parsing JavaScript decorators in TypeScript (i.e. with `experimentalDecorators` disabled), esbuild previously didn't parse type arguments. Type arguments will now be parsed starting with this release. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    @&#8203;foo<number>\n    @&#8203;bar<number, string>()\n    class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix glob patterns matching extra stuff at the end ([#&#8203;3306](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3306))\n\n    Previously glob patterns such as `./*.js` would incorrectly behave like `./*.js*` during path matching (also matching `.js.map` files, for example). This was never intentional behavior, and has now been fixed.\n\n-   Change the permissions of esbuild's generated output files ([#&#8203;3285](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3285))\n\n    This release changes the permissions of the output files that esbuild generates to align with the default behavior of node's [`fs.writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options) function. Since most tools written in JavaScript use `fs.writeFileSync`, this should make esbuild more consistent with how other JavaScript build tools behave.\n\n    The full Unix-y details: Unix permissions use three-digit octal notation where the three digits mean \"user, group, other\" in that order. Within a digit, 4 means \"read\" and 2 means \"write\" and 1 means \"execute\". So 6 == 4 + 2 == read + write. Previously esbuild uses 0644 permissions (the leading 0 means octal notation) but the permissions for `fs.writeFileSync` defaults to 0666, so esbuild will now use 0666 permissions. This does not necessarily mean that the files esbuild generates will end up having 0666 permissions, however, as there is another Unix feature called \"umask\" where the operating system masks out some of these bits. If your umask is set to 0022 then the generated files will have 0644 permissions, and if your umask is set to 0002 then the generated files will have 0664 permissions.\n\n-   Fix a subtle CSS ordering issue with `@import` and `@layer`\n\n    With this release, esbuild may now introduce additional `@layer` rules when bundling CSS to better preserve the layer ordering of the input code. Here's an example of an edge case where this matters:\n\n    ```css\n    /* entry.css */\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"b.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This CSS should set the body background to `green`, which is what happens in the browser. Previously esbuild generated the following output which incorrectly sets the body background to `red`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This difference in behavior is because the browser evaluates `a.css` + `b.css` + `a.css` (in CSS, each `@import` is replaced with a copy of the imported file) while esbuild was only writing out `b.css` + `a.css`. The first copy of `a.css` wasn't being written out by esbuild for two reasons: 1) bundlers care about code size and try to avoid emitting duplicate CSS and 2) when there are multiple copies of a CSS file, normally only the *last* copy matters since the last declaration with equal specificity wins in CSS.\n\n    However, `@layer` was recently added to CSS and for `@layer` the *first* copy matters because layers are ordered using their first location in source code order. This introduction of `@layer` means esbuild needs to change its bundling algorithm. An easy solution would be for esbuild to write out `a.css` twice, but that would be inefficient. So what I'm going to try to have esbuild do with this release is to write out an abbreviated form of the first copy of a CSS file that only includes the `@layer` information, and then still only write out the full CSS file once for the last copy. So esbuild's output for this edge case now looks like this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a;\n\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The behavior of the bundled CSS now matches the behavior of the unbundled CSS. You may be wondering why esbuild doesn't just write out `a.css` first followed by `b.css`. That would work in this case but it doesn't work in general because for any rules outside of a `@layer` rule, the last copy should still win instead of the first copy.\n\n-   Fix a bug with esbuild's TypeScript type definitions ([#&#8203;3299](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3299))\n\n    This release fixes a copy/paste error with the TypeScript type definitions for esbuild's JS API:\n\n    ```diff\n     export interface TsconfigRaw {\n       compilerOptions?: {\n    -    baseUrl?: boolean\n    +    baseUrl?: string\n         ...\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;privatenumber](https://togithub.com/privatenumber).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.47.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.47.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.46.0...v8.47.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`53d7508`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/53d750800b1c0c1f8c29393c488bb3167bb1d2a5) feat: update regex for methods with `thisArg` ([#&#8203;17439](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17439)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`631648e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/631648ee0b51a8951ce576ccd4430e09c9c8bcae) fix: do not report on shadowed constructors in `no-new-wrappers` ([#&#8203;17447](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17447)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`a766a48`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a766a48030d4359db76523d5b413d6332130e485) docs: document lack of config file names ([#&#8203;17442](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17442)) (James)\n-   [`a1635d6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a1635d6198a8baf6571b3351e098e5ac960be887) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`47a0859`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/47a08597966651975126dd6726939cd34f13b80e) docs: update `require-unicode-regexp.md` as following up [#&#8203;17402](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17402) ([#&#8203;17441](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17441)) (SUZUKI Sosuke)\n-   [`fcdc85d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/fcdc85d3a6bc14970c3349cc8d6f3a47eca172a3) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2a92b6c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2a92b6cc9520a27255520369206556e9841a3af8) docs: update with \"Specifying Parser Options\" ([#&#8203;17435](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17435)) (Cheol-Won)\n-   [`d743ed3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/d743ed3c06c62a639da0389ad27907b324ea1715) docs: add metadata for parser/processor ([#&#8203;17438](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17438)) (Huáng Jùnliàng)\n-   [`224376c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/224376cd99a08394291a9584ad9c1ea1283673c6) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`a41a8e4`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a41a8e4a7da14726d6fce71a023f12101fd52fdb) docs: update script names in README ([#&#8203;17432](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17432)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`bf69aa6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/bf69aa6408f5403a88d8c9b71b0e58232b1ea833) chore: Update dependencies ([#&#8203;17456](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17456)) (Nicholas C.

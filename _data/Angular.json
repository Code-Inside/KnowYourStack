In Angular expressions, we can reference \"let-scope\" variables, or member properties / components of the containing Component class. If we want to access module level imports, we must access those through careful orchestration with the Dependency Injector.\r\n\r\nThis decision forces Angular developers to be very explicit about what is accessible to their components. It promotes best practices. But in some circumstances, this aspect of the Angular Template makes it painful for developers and results in a lot of code duplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI propose that the concept of a Module Scoped \"Ambient Value\" be added to the Angular Template syntax. \"Ambient Values\" would work just like any other reference in an Angular Expression, with the only difference being the template value source.\r\n\r\nAmbient Values would need to be declared in the Providers array of an NgModule or Standalone Component, and use the existing Dependency Injection system.\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n\r\nimport { ambientValue } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n   providers: [\r\n      { \r\n        provide: ambientValue('foo'),\r\n        useValue: 'FOO'\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n})\r\nexport class SampleModule {}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe exact syntax for declaring an Ambient Value is up for debate - the important piece of course would be the name used for reference in the Angular Templates, and the value to resolve.\r\n\r\nThe value of an Ambient Value would be resolved once upon the first time rendering a Component - It would have a lifecycle identical to other providers in an Angular Module.\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n<!-- A sample component importing SampleModule -->\r\n\r\n<p>The message is {{foo}}</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- renders, The message is FOO -->\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problems this solves\r\n\r\nFor Component Libraries, there are complicated settings that must be developed. One example is the `Overlay` library from `@angular/cdk`. Charting libraries are another example, any component with a complex object or array of objects requiring configuration.\r\n\r\nTo configure components with complex settings, library authors must either provide an `InjectionToken` and allow consumers to configure behavior, or, provide factory functions and classes expecting consumers to duplicate code at the component typescript level.\r\n\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n// Two possible solutions for shared configuration of a hypothetical charting library\r\n\r\n\r\n// Using Inejction Tokens\r\n\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\nimport { appSpecificFooTheme } from 'app/shared/foo-theme';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-consumer-1',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart>\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n   providers: [{\r\n     provide: FooThemeConfigToken,\r\n     useValue: appSpecificFooTheme \r\n   }]\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsConsumer1Component {}\r\n\r\n\r\n// Using declaration of config values\r\n\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\nimport { appSpecificFooTheme } from 'app/shared/foo-theme';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-consumer-2',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart [theme]=\"fooTheme\">\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsConsumer2Component {\r\n  fooTheme = appSpecificFooTheme;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn the real world, this looks like \"connectedPositionStrategy\", or declaring a `trackBy:` function over and over again.\r\n\r\nAmbient Values would result in the following solution for this chart library:\r\n\r\n````\r\nimport { FooThemeConfigToken } from '@foo-charts/foo-charts-ngx';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'foo-charts-ambient-value-consumer',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <foo-chart [theme]=\"appFooTheme\">\r\n   </foo-chart>\r\n`,\r\n})\r\nexport class FooChartsAmbientValueConsumerComponent {\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ramifications for state management\r\n\r\nIf this were to be introduced to Angular, it would change the game for state management. Right now, services must be directly injected into each component; Every application component that wants to get the login status of a user, a shopping cart inventory, etc. must inject `UserService`, `CartService` etc. and then access methods directly.\r\n\r\n````ts\r\n// Before Ambient Values\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'store-page',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <div>\r\n      <store-item></store-item>\r\n   </div>\r\n   <div *ngIf=\"user.loggedIn\">\r\n      Welcome back! Your cart is {{cart.status}}\r\n   </div>\r\n`\r\n})\r\nexport class StorePage {\r\n   constructor(\r\n     public user: UserService,\r\n     public cart: CartService\r\n   ) {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After Ambient Values (assuming UserService and CartService are ambiently declared as user and cart in a higher module).\r\n@Component({\r\n   selector: 'store-page',\r\n   template: `\r\n   <div>\r\n      <store-item></store-item>\r\n   </div>\r\n   <div *ngIf=\"user.loggedIn\">\r\n      Welcome back! Your cart is {{cart.status}}\r\n   </div>\r\n`\r\n})\r\nexport class StorePage {}\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt is debatable which the best solution is for this; It's likely a terrible idea for shared component libraries, but whether or not it's a poor strategy for particular applications is less clear. \r\n\r\nI can imagine that in a large application development team with varying team-member experience, a Sr. Developer might develop an \"AcmeApplicationState\" module, providing a common vernacular for Jr. Developers to easily access business logic.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis feature may be declared either too much work, or too dangerous as it could promote bad coding practices. However, I think that on the main it would provide powerful ergonomics for developers and would be an appreciated improvement to Angular. For situations where common functions, queries, themes, and state is shared across an entire application, declaring it once in a Module versus re-declaring it in each component would save developers time, and enforce consistency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47560","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Module / Global scoped variables to Angular Template Syntax\" (#47560)"},{"Id":"1387806553","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T13:50:42","Actor":"bob-watson","Number":"47559","RawContent":null,"Title":"System configuration guides for using and developing angular need more detail.","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nTrying to install the required software to develop with and develop for Angular and found the installation instructions have many holes that require numerous trips to stackoverflow et al.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/setup-local\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nThe software, and its dependencies, necessary to develop with and for angular.,\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nTrying to prepare a development environment to build and update angular docs\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nStep by step instructions to install and verify the required software with sufficient information about sequence, and versions \n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\nN/A\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\nNone\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47559","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System configuration guides for using and developing angular need more detail.\" (#47559)"},{"Id":"1387785303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T13:38:21","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"47558","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't subclass FormControl<T>","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, sort of (before Angular 14, FormControl wasn't generic) \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to subclass `FormControl` , TS triggers the following error : `TS2510 : Base constructors must all have the same return type`\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { FormControl, AbstractControl } from '@angular/forms';\r\n\r\nexport class Control<T> extends FormControl<T> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect the definition of [ɵFormControlCtor](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/85b5d125be4c689f892c6c50b94c593b85b513de/packages/forms/src/model/form_control.ts#L358) to be that cause and [#35387](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/35387) to be the root cause of that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgMWiAwhAdjKEA2ANHAIIBGAzrgIYDGMmOe+cAvnAGZ4hwDkAAtSwBzAK75qUAPQc0FXgG4AsAChVAUwAekWHFoSKFOI1wEAPABUAfHC0x1WACZHUUDNlP5LNhKyA\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts to share on that ?

However, there are legitimate situations where one would like to compute / derive a new model value (from the existing model values) before rendering. Angular has no such concept - even if requested by users (ex.: #20472).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe don't have any concrete solution proposal at the moment but we are exploring the space and will open a RFC when the solution space becomes clearer. But even without the concrete proposal on a table, there are certain properties that we would like to see in the final solution:\r\n* semantics of \"recompute only if one of the dependencies changed\";\r\n* composability: it should be possible to construct of chain of computed values (computed depending on other computed);\r\n* great integration in the framework, ex.:\r\n   * `@Input` - it should be possible to compute new model value based on input values changing over time;\r\n   * convenient syntax for accessing computed values in a component / teamplate.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWhile Angular doesn't have the dedicated concept of the computed properties, there are several existing mechanisms that can serve the purpose (although with different caveats). Here is an overview of the possible approaches that work today.\r\n\r\n#### Use an external reactivity system\r\n\r\nMany Angular users integrate RxJS, or similar push-based reactivity systems, into their template rendering pipeline. Most (all?) of the push-based reactivity systems have a concept of deriving values (ex. [combinelatest](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/combination/combinelatest) in RxJS).\r\n\r\n#### Use memoization \r\n\r\nWe could introduce a simple `memo` utility function. A memo function could just compare previous / new arguments and execute re-computation when needed, similar to what the pure pipe does today. Ex. (taken from #46135):\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  fruit = 'banana';\r\n  idFruit = 0;\r\n\r\n  getNameFruitUrl = memo((name: string) => `/fruits/${name}.jpg`);\r\n\r\n  getIdFruitUrl = memo(() => `/fruits/${this.idFruit}.jpg`, () => [this.idFruit]);\r\n\r\n  getLargeFruitUrl = memo((large?: boolean) => `/${large ? 'large' : 'small'}/${this.fruit}.jpg`,\r\n    () => [this.fruit]\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is a working stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-txzpmf?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fmemo.ts\r\n\r\n### Existing issues / PRs\r\n\r\nThe idea of computed properties was discussed in the past in the issue tracker - most notably in #20472 (which generated number of comments and ~70 upvotes).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Computed properties (model => model synchronisation)\" (#47553)"},{"Id":"1387246936","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T07:18:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"47552","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): allow hgroup element","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the compiler didn't allow `hgroup` elements, because they weren't in the schema.\r\n\r\nFixes #47545.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47552","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): allow hgroup element\" (#47552)"},{"Id":"1387097690","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T05:05:09","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"47551","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@types/babel__traverse](https://togithub.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/babel__traverse) ([source](https://togithub.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.18.1` -> `7.18.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@types%2fbabel__traverse/7.18.1/7.18.2) |\n| [io_bazel_rules_sass](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_sass) | http_archive | minor | `1.54.9` -> `1.55.0` |\n| [magic-string](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string) | dependencies | patch | [`0.26.3` -> `0.26.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/magic-string/0.26.3/0.26.4) |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

That could cause any package scripts which used the `esbuild` command to no longer work. This release fixes the regression so `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` should now be present again after installation. This regression only affected people installing esbuild using `npm` with either the `--omit=optional` or `--no-optional` flag, which is a somewhat unusual situation.\n\n    **More details:**\n\n    The reason for this regression is due to some obscure npm implementation details. Since the Go compiler doesn't support trivial cross-compiling on certain Android platforms, esbuild's installer installs a WebAssembly shim on those platforms instead. In the previous release I attempted to simplify esbuild's WebAssembly shims to depend on the `esbuild-wasm` package instead of including another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary (to make publishing faster and to save on file system space after installation). However, both the `esbuild` package and the `esbuild-wasm` package provide a binary called `esbuild` and it turns out that adding `esbuild-wasm` as a nested dependency of the `esbuild` package (specifically `esbuild` optionally depends on `@esbuild/android-arm` which depends on `esbuild-wasm`) caused npm to be confused about what `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` is supposed to be.\n\n    It's pretty strange and unexpected that disabling the installation of optional dependencies altogether would suddenly cause an optional dependency's dependency to conflict with the top-level package. What happens under the hood is that if `--omit=optional` is present, npm attempts to uninstall the `esbuild-wasm` nested dependency at the end of `npm install` (even though the `esbuild-wasm` package was never installed due to `--omit=optional`). This uninstallation causes `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` to be deleted.\n\n    After doing a full investigation, I discovered that npm's handling of the `.bin` directory is deliberately very brittle. When multiple packages in the dependency tree put something in `.bin` with the same name, the end result is non-deterministic/random. What you get in `.bin` might be from one package, from the other package, or might be missing entirely. The workaround suggested by npm is to just avoid having two packages that put something in `.bin` with the same name. So this was fixed by making the `@esbuild/android-arm` and `esbuild-android-64` packages each include another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary, which works because these packages don't put anything in `.bin`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.24.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.24.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.23.1...v8.24.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`1729f9e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1729f9ea4d7b2945b2b701d72027fd4aace954cf) feat: account for `sourceType: \"commonjs\"` in the strict rule ([#&#8203;16308](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16308)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`b0d72c9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/b0d72c96b2a9cde7a5798c2b08ec4e70683c6aca) feat: add rule logical-assignment-operators ([#&#8203;16102](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16102)) (fnx)\n-   [`f02bcd9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f02bcd91bf89b6c167d5346a36677fdb854f0c05) feat: `array-callback-return` support `findLast` and `findLastIndex` ([#&#8203;16314](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16314)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`2c152ff`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2c152ff0fb709b99e62c19ecd2c95689efacbe4c) docs: note false positive `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` in prefer-reflect ([#&#8203;16317](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16317)) (AnnAngela)\n-   [`bf7bd88`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/bf7bd885a92046a6b6bcbcaaa1e78e9f2c4b482f) docs: fix warn severity description for new config files ([#&#8203;16324](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16324)) (Nitin Kumar)\n-   [`8cc0bbe`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/8cc0bbe440dc5e6af6ef02f00d0514a40ca07c24) docs: use more clean link syntax ([#&#8203;16309](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16309)) (Percy Ma)\n-   [`6ba269e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/6ba269ed673f965d081287b769c12beeb5f98887) docs: fix typo ([#&#8203;16288](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16288)) (jjangga0214)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`131e646`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/131e646e227b9aca3937fe287343bf2c3df408af) chore: Upgrade [@&#8203;humanwhocodes/config-array](https://togithub.com/humanwhocodes/config-array) for perf ([#&#8203;16339](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16339)) (Nicholas C.

Previously, numbers were considered equal if they\n    were within `1e-11` of one another, which led to some circumstances where `$a == $b` and `$b == $c` but `$a != $b`.\n\n[transitive]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_property\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** Various functions in `sass:math` no longer\n    treat floating-point numbers that are very close (but not identical) to\n    integers as integers. Instead, these functions now follow the floating-point\n    specification exactly. For example, `math.pow(0.000000000001, -1)` now returns\n    `1000000000000` instead of `Infinity`.\n\n-   Emit a deprecation warning for `$a -$b` and `$a +$b`, since these look like\n    they could be unary operations but they're actually parsed as binary\n    operations. Either explicitly write `$a - $b` or `$a (-$b)`. See\n    https://sass-lang.com/d/strict-unary for more details.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add an optional `argumentName` parameter to `SassScriptException()` to make it\n    easier to throw exceptions associated with particular argument names.\n\n-   Most APIs that previously returned `num` now return `double`. All APIs\n    continue to *accept* `num`, although in Dart 2.0.0 these APIs will be changed\n    to accept only `double`.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix a bug in which certain warning spans would not have their properties\n    accessible by the JS API.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Instead we now use the browsers that are configured in the Browserslist configuration to determine which ECMA features and version are needed. This is done by passing the transpiled TypeScript to Babel preset-env.\r\n\r\n**Note about useDefineForClassFields**: while setting this to `false` will output JavaScript which is not spec compliant, this is needed because TypeScript introduced class fields many years before it was ratified in TC39. The latest version of the spec have a different runtime behavior to TypeScript’s implementation but the same syntax. Therefore, we opt-out from using upcoming ECMA runtime behavior to better support the ECO system and libraries that depend on the non spec compliant output. One of biggest case is usages of the deprecated `@Effect` decorator by NGRX and potentially other existing code as well which otherwise would cause runtime failures. Dropping `useDefineForClassFields` will be considered in a future major releases. For more information see: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45995.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Internally the Angular CLI now always set the TypeScript `target` to `ES2022` and `useDefineForClassFields` to `false` unless the target is set to `ES2022` or later in the TypeScript configuration.

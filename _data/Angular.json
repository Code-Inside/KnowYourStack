Those have transition of background color defined on them meant to run when user is hovering or clicking. But in our app this transition is running on initial rendering also which results in an annoying flash-like effect (as it transitions from default user-agent defined background to the one set in the css class).\r\nAfter 2 days of debugging I figured that it is related to the fact that we are adding our classes using `[class]` binding as we don't use the emulated encapsulation we have our own engine that creates unique class names. And this doesn't happen consistently e.g. we have 2 elemnts of the same component in the template and only the first one would be rendered without flash and the consequent ones would have a flash. \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15785773/196486750-70dc824d-5f35-496e-9def-5dce36e2a358.mov\r\n\r\nOn the video above you can see the rendering order of the elements. The buttons with `TEXT` written on them have `class=\"myclass\"` hardcoded on them and are rendered instantly with the first cycle. The other 2 are buttons of the select element and classes are applied on them using `[class]=\"'myclass'\"`. And what would happen if I would refreshed the page without breakpoints is that the first element with `[class]=\"'myclass'\"` would appear to be rendered instantly just like `TEXT` but the second one (fourth if you count all of them from top to bottom) would have animation on it.\r\nThis is can be observed in the minimal repro with a much simpler setup (check `extra.component.ts`). What I realized causes it here is the `[style.width.px]=\"ref.offsetWidth\"` somewhere in the template before the element that uses `[style]` binding. But as I remove this in my app I still have the flashing effect until I remove the resolvers from the page, but I obviously need those. So it looks like this happens whenever something is delaying the rerendering of components (as initial Ivy render doesn't apply the bindings).\r\n\r\nI suppose we can work this issue around by adding `transition` into `:hover` and `:active` blocks but would be great if this can be somehow fixed in a normal way. Why does Ivy not apply bindings in the first rendering cycle even though the value for it is already available?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-e2z8fp?file=src/app/extra.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.6\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage manager: npm 8.5.5\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In some cases using bindings to add styles/classses leads to unintentional transitions\" (#47803)"},{"Id":"1413150548","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-18T12:34:54","Actor":"xiexiaobo135","Number":"47802","RawContent":null,"Title":"string and RegExp are not logically consistent","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/0d65e1de2c8ea76a5e48df227638cdeabac82c42/packages/forms/src/validators.ts#L534\r\nHello~\r\n```\r\nlet test1 = \"\\\\d{2}\";\r\nlet test2 = /\\d{2}/;  // or new RegExp(test1)\r\n...\r\nValidators.pattern(test1);\r\n// !==, without ^ and $ ???

Generally this works but if the browser tab crashes due to using too much memory, the page will reload but perform an initial navigation before the routes are registered, causing a white screen of death. After spending days debugging this (due to tab crashing and not being able to log anything) I've worked out that this is the ordering of events:\r\n - NavigationStart (popstate with restoredState) \r\n - NavigationError (Cannot match any routes)\r\n - Add routes and call `router.initialNavigation()`\r\n\r\nThis is how we configure the router:\r\n```ts\r\nRouterModule.forRoot([], {\r\n  initialNavigation: 'disabled',\r\n  onSameUrlNavigation: 'reload',\r\n  paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always',\r\n  scrollPositionRestoration: 'top',\r\n  relativeLinkResolution: 'corrected',\r\n}),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen comparing our site to competitors in the same industry, every other website is able to gracefully recover from a crashed tab except for ours which is the only Angular site. \r\n\r\nIf it's expected behaviour then I'm not sure how we're meant to workaround it apart from get a white screen and expect the user ot refresh.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nI've downloaded the Tour of Heroes zip, pushed it as a commit and then my reproduction on top of that here for the exact changes: https://github.com/intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug/commit/107da944332a627316fda72dfcdd7e2a02dae600#diff-2d2675bb4687601a5c7ccf707455132f90f3516a33716185687e5c41df59ac7d\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone git@github.com:intellix/angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug.git\r\ncd angular-router-crash-initial-nav-bug\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run dev:ssr --host=0.0.0.0\r\nifconfig | grep inet // grab your IP address\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen go to it on your iPhone using your IP address on the same network (if you do it on desktop, the tab doesn't really crash and restart the same).\r\n \r\nGo to heroes and click the \"Crash browser tab\" button. You'll notice that it didn't refresh on the current route and it couldn't match a route. If you go to connect with Safari Developer Tools, you can see the list of events that occured as they're being stored (you can't use logs as the browser crashes entirely):\r\n```\r\nwindow.appEvents\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will look something like so:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1016\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-10-17 at 18 14 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1162531/196243833-fbd77409-a475-4916-9968-629f355f1994.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n###\r\nPlease provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nAlso tried with 14 and it's the same thing.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nTemporary workaround:\r\n\r\n**route.service.ts:**\r\n```ts\r\nexport class RouteService {\r\n  events$ = this.router.events.pipe(shareReplay({ refCount: true, bufferSize: 1 }));\r\n  constructor(private router: Router) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**cms-route.service.ts:**\r\n```ts\r\n setup() {\r\n  // Add routes from CMS\r\n  this.router.config.unshift(...configs);\r\n  this.router.config.push({\r\n    path: '**',\r\n    outlet: 'primary',\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    redirectTo: '',\r\n  });\r\n  this.router.initialNavigation();\r\n\r\n  // Force a navigation if an initial navigation happened before routes were registered\r\n  this.routeService.events$\r\n    .pipe(take(1), filter(isNavigationError))\r\n    .subscribe(event => this.router.navigateByUrl(event.url));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry for opening a nearly identical issue to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47785 - I was asked to do so with a reproduction so here it is","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47789","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router's popstate listener incompatible with asynchronous route configs and when popstate fires on page load (a safari bug)\" (#47789)"},{"Id":"1411941781","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-17T17:25:42","Actor":"trekladyone","Number":"47788","RawContent":null,"Title":"Route transition animations update","State":"open","Body":"Linting suggested corrections made.

I've tried below but the route.data is undefined.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ title: ProductNameTitleResolver, resolve: { product: ProductResolverService } } // Route\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class ProductNameTitleResolver implements Resolve<string> {\r\n  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): string | Promise<string> | Observable<string>  {\r\n    const productData = route.data['product'] // Unfortunately this is undefined\r\n    return `Product ${productData.name}`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be useful to eliminate the need to make two http calls in this situation (one for the route-resolver and one for the title-resolver).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPopulate route-resolver data into title-resolvers' route.data.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47781","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How can I use a route's resolve data in a title resolver?\" (#47781)"},{"Id":"1411344576","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-17T13:41:04","Actor":"intellix","Number":"47785","RawContent":null,"Title":"Router initialNavigation disabled is ignored for pushstate after the tab crashes","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe're loading routes via CMS before manually triggering an initialNavigation. Generally this works but if the browser tab crashes due to using too much memory, the page will reload but perform an initial navigation before the routes are registered, causing a white screen of death. After spending days debugging this (due to tab crashing and not being able to log anything) I've worked out that this is the ordering of events:\r\n - NavigationStart (popstate with restoredState) \r\n - NavigationError (Cannot match any routes)\r\n - Add routes and call `router.initialNavigation()`\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in this screenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1098\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-10-17 at 11 37 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1162531/196157161-9d73a1f4-932a-4ff0-98c8-e47beed3e0cd.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is how we configure the router:\r\n```ts\r\nRouterModule.forRoot([], {\r\n  initialNavigation: 'disabled',\r\n  onSameUrlNavigation: 'reload',\r\n  paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always',\r\n  scrollPositionRestoration: 'top',\r\n  relativeLinkResolution: 'corrected',\r\n}),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen comparing our site to competitors in the same industry, every other website is able to gracefully recover from a crashed tab except for ours which is the only Angular site. \r\n\r\nIf it's expected behaviour then I'm not sure how we're meant to workaround it apart from get a white screen and expect the user ot refresh.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nAlso tried with 14 and it's the same thing.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nTemporary workaround:\r\n\r\n**route.service.ts:**\r\n```ts\r\nexport class RouteService {\r\n  events$ = this.router.events.pipe(shareReplay({ refCount: true, bufferSize: 1 }));\r\n  constructor(private router: Router) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**cms-route.service.ts:**\r\n```ts\r\n// Add routes from CMS\r\nthis.router.config.unshift(...configs);\r\nthis.router.config.push({\r\n  path: '**',\r\n  outlet: 'primary',\r\n  pathMatch: 'full',\r\n  redirectTo: '',\r\n});\r\nthis.router.initialNavigation();\r\n\r\n// Force a navigation if an initial navigation happened before routes were registered\r\nthis.routeService.events$\r\n  .pipe(take(1), filter(isNavigationError))\r\n  .subscribe(event => this.router.navigateByUrl(event.url));\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47785","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Router initialNavigation disabled is ignored for pushstate after the tab crashes\" (#47785)"},{"Id":"1411525810","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-17T12:51:23","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"47787","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(language-service): Allow auto-imports to suggest multiple possible imports.","State":"open","Body":"This change allows the language service to suggest imports for *all* directives returned from the compiler, and for *all* import specifiers for each directive.

These edge cases are listed below:\n\n    ```js\n    async function test() {\n      class Foo { foo() { return this } }\n      class Bar extends Foo {\n        a = async () => super.foo``\n        b = async () => super['foo']``\n        c = async (foo) => super[foo]``\n      }\n      function foo() { return this }\n      const obj = { foo }\n      const bar = new Bar\n      console.log(\n        (await bar.a()) === bar,\n        (await bar.b()) === bar,\n        (await bar.c('foo')) === bar,\n        { foo }.foo``.foo === foo,\n        (true && obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (false || obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n        (null ?? obj.foo)`` !== obj,\n      )\n    }\n    test()\n    ```\n\n    Each edge case in the code above previously incorrectly printed `false` when run through esbuild with `--minify --target=es6` but now correctly prints `true`. These edge cases are unlikely to have affected real-world code.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Initially I thought it was just the presence of `*ngIf=\"...\"` on the `mat-radio-button`, but after trying to reproduce I found it was somewhat more subtle than that and seems to require another mat-radio-group in some specific arrangement to trigger the problem.\r\n\r\nI was eventually able to reliably reproduce the error by including a specific element before radio group, which you can see in the stackblitz example, although presumably there are other ways to trigger the issue. For example, in my attached example, the issue only occurs if the broken radio group is placed after the container, but when I originally produced this issue, it did not seem to matter where in the template I placed the broken radio group. \r\n\r\nI found a work around to resolve the issue for the time being, if I use `[value]=\"'value'\"` instead of `value=\"value\"` the component once again works as expected, which you can see in the \"Fixed Radio Group\" in the stackblitz example. Even with this fix, I hope we can identify the underlying issue because it seems tricky enough that other developers could run into it and it may be causing other problems beyond what I'm observing here.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ntbc1n?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,angular.json,src%2Fstyles.css,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ntbc1n?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,angular.json,src%2Fstyles.css,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n2. Notice that although the \"Broken\" and \"Fixed\" Radio Group both use nearly identical code, the \"Broken\" radio group has no checked option initially, but the \"Fixed\" Radio Group works as expected.\r\n3. Try modifying the template to observe how sensitive this issue is to seemingly unrelated context. For example:\r\n4. Removing `*ngIf=\"true\"` from the broken radio group option A will fix the issue.\r\n5. Removing  `*ngIf=\"true\"` from the ngContainer around \"Some Mode\" Radio Group will fix the issue.\r\n6. Deleting the \"Some Mode\" Radio Group (while leaving the container) will fix the issue.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Radio Button that matches the initial value in the FormControl should be selected initially, and the state of seemingly unrelated elements should have no impact on this.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo Radio Button is initially checked in the \"Broken Radio Group\" example, despite using code that seems like it should be functionally identical to the \"Fixed Radio Group\", which is working as expected.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.2.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 106.0.5249.119\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25831","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatRadioGroup): MatRadioButton sometimes not checked initially when using a FormControl\" (#25831)"},{"Id":"1411032818","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-18T12:27:44","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25821","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): animations not disabled with NoopAnimationsModule","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the animations of the slide toggle weren't disabled when using the `NoopAnimationsModule`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): animations not disabled with NoopAnimationsModule\" (#25821)"},{"Id":"1412885012","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-18T09:31:30","Actor":"Arti3DPlayer","Number":"25830","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): Custom input validation message not showing with mat-stepper","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI implemented custom control based on official guides using `ControlValueAccessor`:\r\n\r\n- https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control\r\n- https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-custom-form-controls/\r\n\r\nThe issue that validation error is not showing until we touch our custom field.

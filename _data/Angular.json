In my case, I have a monorepo from which I build many libraries. I have a pipeline that has a prepare stage/job, which runs npm install into a common node_modules directory, and then I spawn about 20 different jobs in parallel which build the libraries.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

router ([#&#8203;38674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38674)) ([db21c4f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/db21c4f))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** This change corrects the argument order when calling\n    RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute. Previously, when evaluating child\n    routes, they would be called with the future and current arguments would\n    be swapped. If your RouteReuseStrategy relies specifically on only the future\n    or current snapshot state, you may need to update the shouldReuseRoute\n    implementation's use of \"future\" and \"current\" ActivateRouteSnapshots.\n-   **common:** The locale data API has been marked as returning readonly arrays, rather\n    than mutable arrays, since these arrays are shared across calls to the\n    API. If you were mutating them (e.g. calling `sort()`, `push()`, `splice()`, etc)\n    then your code will not longer compile. If you need to mutate the array, you\n    should now take a copy (e.g. by calling `slice()`) and mutate the copy.\n-   **common:** When passing a date-time formatted string to the `DatePipe` in a format that contains\n    fractions of a millisecond, the milliseconds will now always be rounded down rather than\n    to the nearest millisecond.\n\nMost applications will not be affected by this change. If this is not the desired behaviour\nthen consider pre-processing the string to round the millisecond part before passing\nit to the `DatePipe`.\n\n#### 10.1.2 (2020-09-16)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** detect pipes in ICUs in template binder ([#&#8203;38810](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38810)) ([ec2dbe7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ec2dbe7)), closes [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)\n-   **core:** clear the `RefreshTransplantedView` when detached ([#&#8203;38768](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38768)) ([edb7f90](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/edb7f90)), closes [#&#8203;38619](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38619)\n-   **localize:** ensure that `formatOptions` is optional ([#&#8203;38787](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38787)) ([a47383d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a47383d))\n-   **router:** Ensure routes are processed in priority order and only if needed ([#&#8203;38780](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38780)) ([9c51ba3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9c51ba3)), closes [#&#8203;38691](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38691)\n-   **upgrade:** add try/catch when downgrading injectables ([#&#8203;38671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38671)) ([5de2ac3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5de2ac3)), closes [#&#8203;37579](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37579)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** only emit directive/pipe references that are used ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([5658405](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5658405))\n-   **compiler-cli:** optimize computation of type-check scope information ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([ebede67](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ebede67))\n-   **ngcc:** introduce cache for sharing data across entry-points ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([58411e7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/58411e7))\n-   **ngcc:** reduce maximum worker count ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([ea36466](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ea36466))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It would be nice to be able to disable the 'asc' option, so that the various columns can still be sorted, but clicking again will do nothing.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(material/sort): Implement API to disable sort direction change\" (#20581)"},{"Id":"702222342","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-15T20:06:13","Actor":"ajtowf","Number":"20577","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix dialog bottomsheet docs","State":"open","Body":"Docs now reflect that entryComponents is redundant with Ivy, but is still required by ViewEngine.

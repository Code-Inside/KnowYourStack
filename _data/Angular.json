To my understanding it isn't possible to translate dynamic values at runtime using angular/localize out of the box. Such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// component.ts\r\nwords = ['hello', 'world']\r\n\r\n// component.html\r\n@for (word of words; track word) {\r\n<p i18n=\"@@{{word}}\">\r\n {{word}}\r\n</p>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also tried using the $localize in the ts file such as ```words=[$localize`hello`, $localize`world`]```\r\n\r\nNeither of these is possible in angular/localize due to it being translated at compile time.

Or am I mistaken on the capabilties?\r\n\r\nThank you! 💖\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI don't know what would be a viable solution for Angular/Localize since the translations are generated at compile time?

I think a translate pipe would be very nice and easy to work with, but maybe it's not an easy task.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI might very well be wrong, but in my scenario it seems like the only solution would be switching to a third-party library such as [transloco](https://jsverse.github.io/transloco/).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56318","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular localize support dynamic/runtime translations\" (#56318)"},{"Id":"2339251317","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T22:34:34","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56315","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): include public constructor paramters to class properties.","State":"open","Body":"Public properties declared in the constructor are part of the public API and we should extract them.\r\n\r\nFixes #56310\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56315","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): include public constructor paramters to class properties.\" (#56315)"},{"Id":"2339212496","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T21:55:07","Actor":"darya-startsava","Number":"56314","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: diagrams have wrong colors on angular.dev","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nCompare the diagram on angular.dev page with GH Markdown version:\r\n[angular.dev](https://angular.dev/best-practices/skipping-subtrees#an-event-is-handled-by-a-component-with-default-change-detection):\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/86919538/8d124c9d-03a3-4e08-a4b0-129d966cfb73)\r\n\r\n[GH Markdown](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/best-practices/runtime-performance/skipping-subtrees.md#an-event-is-handled-by-a-component-with-default-change-detection):\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/86919538/38d35b13-d013-45c1-8314-d97c36cc56f7)\r\n\r\nAll diagrams are supposed to be displayed in color as specified in the Markdown file.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/best-practices/skipping-subtrees#using-onpush\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56314","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: diagrams have wrong colors on angular.dev\" (#56314)"},{"Id":"2337611824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T20:41:15","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"56300","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(localize): add `@angular/localize/init` as polyfill in `angular.json`","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the `@angular/localize/init` polyfill is not included when there are no polyfills specified in the `angular.json` file.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56300","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(localize): add `@angular/localize/init` as polyfill in `angular.json`\" (#56300)"},{"Id":"2338498897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T20:40:37","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56306","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56306","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release\" (#56306)"},{"Id":"2339089286","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T20:20:44","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56311","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): WIP - partial hydration prototype","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56311","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): WIP - partial hydration prototype\" (#56311)"},{"Id":"2338941136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T18:47:31","Actor":"amayer42","Number":"56310","RawContent":null,"Title":"Some public APIs are not properly displayed in Angular.dev","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI was looking at the documentation for [ActivatedRouteSnapshot](https://angular.dev/api/router/ActivatedRouteSnapshot) and noticed that the `params` class field was not shown.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that it is part of the public API from looking at the [ActivatedRouteSnapshot source code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/router_state.ts#L321-L423) and from looking at the shipped `d.ts` file for the Angular router.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.1\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI have tried to override the esbuild version to the latest version by using the overrides command in package.json.\r\n\r\n\"overrides\": {\r\n     \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": {\r\n           \"esbuild\": \"0.21.4\"\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter this I ran the scan again and yet it did not fix the issue since esbuild version 0.21.4 uses go version of 1.20.12\r\n\r\nIs there version of esbuild used by @angular-devkit/build-angular which solves this issue?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27797","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CVE-2023-45288 vulnerability in esbuild (golang version 1.20.12)\" (#27797)"},{"Id":"2337325229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T00:07:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27790","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/dependency-review-action](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action) | action | patch | `v4.3.2` -> `v4.3.3` |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/verdaccio/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/dependency-review-action (actions/dependency-review-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.3`](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases/tag/v4.3.3): Notes for v4.3.3\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Allow slashes in purl package names by [@&#8203;juxtin](https://togithub.com/juxtin) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765)\n-   use the v3 version of the deps.dev API by [@&#8203;josieang](https://togithub.com/josieang) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741)\n-   PR with suggestions -

If so, I would greatly appreciate some advice. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. ng new test-project --ssr\r\n2. update angular.json with \"sourceMap\": true in the production build configuration.  \r\n3. ng build\r\n4. Set a breakpoint in server.ts - it will be red\r\n5. Add \"Launch Program\" configuration to launch.json, with \"program\" pointing to server.mjs and \"sourceMaps\": true \r\n6. Execute \"Launch Program\" debug. \r\n7. The server will start, but the breakpoint in server.ts will become an empty circle - Unbound breakpoint. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI don't think it matters, but I'm using macOS 14.5, VS Code 1.89.1, npm 10.8.1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27773","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't debug Server Typescript in an Angular SSR project  \" (#27773)"},{"Id":"2335469438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T15:12:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add `--inspect` option to the dev-server","State":"closed","Body":"This commit introduces an `--inspect` option to the dev-server, enabling debugging of server-side code when using SSR or SSG.

Observe that all components use the primary color for different types (accent, warn).\r\n\r\nstyles.scss:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-06-06 085945](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/24419240/c625ce44-a48d-41ae-84b2-9f7ec9db5df0)\r\n\r\nComponent: \r\n![Screenshot 2024-06-06 090103](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/24419240/2f33d083-a897-4a17-a034-d8ccf9654473)\r\n\r\nResult Preview: \r\n![Screenshot 2024-06-06 090156](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/24419240/9c78ff56-c9b6-4618-aeaa-6a69e4ee0789)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe components should display the correct colors for primary, accent, and warn as defined.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAll components are displaying the same primary color regardless of the defined custom theme settings.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular: 18.0.0\r\nCDK/Material: 18.0.2\r\nBrowser(s): Chrome\r\nOperating System: Windows\r\n\r\nPlease investigate this issue as it affects the overall appearance and functionality of the application using Angular Material with custom themes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29206","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Material Theme): Custom Theme Colors All Using Primary Color\" (#29206)"},{"Id":"2340296625","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T13:33:34","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29213","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(material/bottom-sheet): fix broken tests","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes some tests that were broken by a recent change.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29213","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(material/bottom-sheet): fix broken tests\" (#29213)"},{"Id":"2340352059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T12:36:28","Actor":"DzmVasileusky","Number":"29214","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Typography): It isn't clear how to customise Material 3 typography","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nMaterial 2 docs were pretty clear about how to customise typography. \r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n$my-custom-level: mat.m2-define-typography-level(\r\n  $font-family: Roboto,\r\n  $font-weight: 400,\r\n  $font-size: 1rem,\r\n  $line-height: 1,\r\n  $letter-spacing: normal,\r\n);\r\n\r\n$my-custom-typography-config: mat.m2-define-typography-config(\r\n  $headline-1: mat.m2-define-typography-level(112px, 112px, 300, $letter-spacing: -0.05em),\r\n  $headline-2: mat.m2-define-typography-level(56px, 56px, 400, $letter-spacing: -0.02em),\r\n  $headline-3: mat.m2-define-typography-level(45px, 48px, 400, $letter-spacing: -0.005em),\r\n  $headline-4: mat.m2-define-typography-level(34px, 40px, 400),\r\n  $headline-5: mat.m2-define-typography-level(24px, 32px, 400),\r\n  // ...\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current page called \"Customizing Typography\" doesn't have an information on how to customise it at all.

In a service I have a method with defined types for `CdkDragEnter`'s item and container data.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/drag-drop/directives/drop-list.ts#L138\r\n\r\n`CdkDropList`'s `entered` is typed like this: `EventEmitter<CdkDragEnter<T>>` which results in `CdkDragEnter`'s 2nd type argument assuming the same type as the 1st argument. That way it won't allow me to define two different types for the container's and the item's data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. define an element in template \r\n2. add `cdkDropList` directive\r\n3. add arbitrary data to `cdkDropListData` directive\r\n4. add `(cdkDropListEntered)=\"onDropListEnter($event)` to react to the event\r\n5. define `onDropListEnter` liks this:\r\n```ts\r\n  onDropListEnter(event: CdkDragEnter<DropListDataType, SomeDragItemType>) {\r\n    this.dropListEnterEvent.emit(event);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTyping for `entered` Event Emitter allows different types between item and container data.\r\nThis is already the case for the `dropped` Event Emitter which is typed like this: `EventEmitter<CdkDragDrop<T, any>>`\r\nSo I'm guessing that this could already be a possible solution?\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`$event` in `(cdkDropListEntered)=\"onDropListEnter($event)` gets highlighted in red and build fails because `The types of 'container.data' are incompatible between these types.`\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.3\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29212","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): Wrong type assumed for dropped item in CdkDropList's cdkDropListEntered (alias for \"entered\")\" (#29212)"},{"Id":"2339983022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T09:17:35","Actor":"kemotx90","Number":"29211","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular M3 custom thema apply wrong contrast - Material 18","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n17.* with m-2 custom palette contrast definition\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWith M-3 custom theme and custom palette (generated with suggested material schema) the contrast applied it's lower than expected.\r\n\r\nmy related [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78538323/how-to-apply-contrast-to-angular-material-theme-m-3)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-st8e6a?file=src%2Fstyles%2Fpalette%2Fpalette.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce: run application\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\ncontrast applyed by the following rules\r\n[M3 roles](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nlow contrast applied and text unreadable (black text on blue content)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 18.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29211","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular M3 custom thema apply wrong contrast - Material 18\" (#29211)"},{"Id":"2339537205","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T03:56:54","Actor":"mattiLeBlanc","Number":"29210","RawContent":null,"Title":"Youtube-player: add @input for youtube playlistId","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, you can load a video using the `videoId` input.

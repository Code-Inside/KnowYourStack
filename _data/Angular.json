Howver, since a signal/effect cannot be created anywhere (must be in injection context and outside of reactive context), we opted out and decided to use rxjs instead. This is fine, since the model is actually independent of Angular itself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have a component that consists of pages. Each page can display validation errors found on that given page. The validation errors come from the model stated above.\r\n\r\nPreviously, while the model used signals, we were able to take advantage of the lazyness of the signal read operations. Consider the following simplified example:\r\n```\r\n// model class\r\nreadonly errors = computed<string[]>(() => ...);\r\n\r\n// page class\r\nreadonly model = input.required<Model>();\r\nreadonly visited = signal(false);\r\nreadonly pageErrors = computed(() => this.visited() ? this.model().errors() : []);\r\n```\r\nSo when we used (read) the `pageErrors` we only evaluated the model's `errors` if the page were ever visited.\r\n\r\nUsing signals in components is comfortable so we used the `toSignal` from rxjs-interop, something like this:\r\n```\r\n// model class\r\nreadonly errors$: Observable<string[]> = ...\r\n\r\n// page class\r\nreadonly modelErrors = toSignal(model.errors$, { initialValue: [] });\r\nreadonly pageErrors = computed(() => this.visited() ? this.modelErrors() : []);\r\n```\r\nHowever, the `toSignal` call has a non-trivial consequence that it subscribes immediately, losing the lazy-evaluation aspect. The other way around (`toObservable`) is pretty much the same, maybe even worse (since it uses `effect` in its implementation that always runs at least once).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think the `toSignal` and `toObservable` should get a deeper integration, allowing us to avoid use-cases like this. It would be the best if all computed signal properties (lazy + memoized) could be kept when using `toSignal` - only subscribe when the signal value is read, and unsubscribe when the signal's refcount becomes 0 (all its listeners are unsubscribed).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently there is no appropriate workaround, at least we could not find any. We could opt-out of using signals, but it has its advantages that we'd like to keep.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55337","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"toSignal causes the signal to not being lazy-evaluated\" (#55337)"},{"Id":"2242262602","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-14T17:02:30","Actor":"erfanfarhadi75","Number":"55336","RawContent":null,"Title":"developer preview features","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nAt present, angular.dev and angular.io lack a dedicated page or section pointing out active developer preview features.

canonicalization could be cached incorrectly\n    when custom importers or the Node.js package importer made decisions based on\n    the URL of the containing stylesheet.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Allow

Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v14.1.1...v14.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   added the `modern-compiler` value for API to reuse compiler process ([#&#8203;1195](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/1195)) ([cef40a8](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/cef40a8af9891adca9fc99d9641b46dc58db023f))\n-   support webpack built-in resolver for `modern` and `modern-compiler` API ([#&#8203;1197](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/1197)) ([2265b72](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/2265b72c4899a6784e0785938f892743d1c942bf))\n\nNotes:\n\nUsing the `modern-compiler` value for the `api` option together with `sass-embedded` reduces compilation time by 5-10 times, especially for projects using large files with a lot of `@import`/`@use`, for small files the build time reduction will not be significant.\n\n##### [14.1.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v14.1.0...v14.1.1) (2024-02-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   handle `pkg:` scheme

I know its a lot of work but it would be great to have it in the documentation. I would put there some of the most common ways to style a component. For example for mat card how to remove elevation. For buttons how to change colors outside of the primary. We all love material design but we need these things to make our apps feel like our apps. \r\n\r\nIn the styling guide how are we supposed to know what mat.define-dark-theme properties etc. We need more documentation about those. \r\n\r\nI find myself googling these simple things every time i am implementing some of the designs and it is frustrating.

By doing so, we can create another DialogContainer aside from CdkDialogContainer, e.g. LeaveAnimationAwareDialogContainer, which performs a leave animation that does nothing but `animateChild()`.

During adding the sort functionality to the tables I've experienced very strange behaviors of MatSort. In some components the setter of MatSort is executed multiple times and in other components just once.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I have to handle the MatSort in components where it's only set once differently as in the components where it's set multiple times.\r\n\r\nI've searched for reasons. But haven't found any. The strange thing is that two of all components are almost the same but in one component the MatSort's setter is executed multiple times and in the other just once. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nI don't know how I can reproduce the bug, because both components I speak about in the description set the table's data-source initially `public dataSource = new MatTableDataSource<Data2>();` and overwrite it after the data is set asynchron` this.dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(this.data);`. In some components the MatSort's setter is exeuted again if this.dataSource has been overwritten. \r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-omvcop?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponent-two%2Fcomponent-two.component.ts\r\n\r\nIn the Stackblitz you can see that I have to assign the matSort's-value to a private property in **component one** where I load the data asynchron. \r\n\r\nIn **component two** the data is loaded synchron and the mat-sort works from the beginning. **Important**: In my application the data in component2 is loadad asynchon too, but has the behavior as if I would load the data synchron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality and behavior has to work for asynchron loaded data equal.  \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality is different between two components that load the data asynchron. In one of them it works and in the other it doesn't\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^15.5.1\r\n- CDK/Material: ^15.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28873","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"MatSort: Setter is executed multiple times in some components and just once in other components\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2237242049","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-12T14:45:58","Actor":"NCC1701M","Number":"28861","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-selection-list): A List with single selection still writes an array instead an single value","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nnot tested\n\n### Description\n\nWhen you are using `[(ngModel)]` on a `mat-selection-list` which is configured to only select a single option, `ngModel` still writes an array value instead of a single value.\r\n\r\nWhen a value is selected, the selected values json representation is displayed e.g. `[ \"Sneakers\" ]`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/xh9gxz-ae2ipa\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

We would like to expose the types of the Language Service to external\r\n   users (like the VSCode extension) via the npm package, on the top\r\n   level of the package\r\n2. We would like the View Engine and Ivy LS to share a common interface\r\n   (notably after the inclusion of `getTcb`, the Ivy LS upholds a\r\n   strict superset of `ts.LanguageService`; previously both VE and Ivy\r\n   LS were aligned on `ts.LanguageService`.)\r\n\r\nTo this end, this commit refactors the exports on the toplevel of the\r\n`language-service/` package to just be types common to both the VE and\r\nIvy language services. The VE and Ivy build targets then import and use\r\nthese types accordingly, and the expectation is that an external user\r\nwill just import the relevant typings from the toplevel package without\r\ndiving into either the VE or Ivy sources.\r\n\r\nFollow up on #40607\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I have not implemented an equivalent for `FormArray`, but this could be done if there is a use case (perhaps call it `FormTuple`?).\r\n\r\nTypes should for the most part be inferred automatically by typescript when constructing the control (or using the `FormBuilder`).\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst c = new FormControl('test');\r\n// types:\r\n// c: FormControl<string>\r\n// c.value: string | null\r\n// c.valueChanges: Observable<string | null>\r\n\r\nconst a = new FormArray([\r\n  new FormControl('value'),\r\n  new FormControl('other value')\r\n]);\r\n// types:\r\n// a: FormArray<FormControl<string>>\r\n// a.value: (string | null)[]\r\n\r\nconst a2 = new FormArray([\r\n  new FormControl('value'),\r\n  new FormControl(5)\r\n]);\r\n// types:\r\n// a2: FormArray<FormControl<string> | FormControl<number>>\r\n// a2.value: (string | number | null)[]\r\n\r\nconst a3 = new FormArray<FormControl<string>>([\r\n  new FormControl('value'),\r\n  new FormControl(5)\r\n// Error: Type 'FormControl<number>' is not assignable to type 'FormControl<string>'\r\n]);\r\n\r\nconst g = new FormGroup({\r\n  one: new FormControl('value'),\r\n  two: new FormControl(10)\r\n});\r\n// types:\r\n// g: FormGroup<FormControl<string> | FormControl<number>>\r\n// g.value: { [key: string]: string | number | null }\r\n\r\nconst s = new FormSection({\r\n  name: new FormControl<string>(),\r\n  details: new FormSection({\r\n    size: new FormControl<'small' | 'medium' | 'large'>(),\r\n    weight: new FormControl<number>()\r\n  }),\r\n  locations: new FormGroup({\r\n    usa: new FormSection({\r\n      cost: new FormControl<number>(),\r\n      count: new FormControl<number>()\r\n    }),\r\n    japan: new FormSection({\r\n      cost: new FormControl<number>(),\r\n      count: new FormControl<number>()\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n// types:\r\n// s.controls.details.controls.size.value: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | null\r\n// s.controls.locations.controls['usa'].controls.cost: FormControl<number>\r\n// s.value.locations['japan'].cost: number | null\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\nAll places where a `FormControl`, `FormArray`, or `FormGroup` are constructed must be replaced with `FormControl<any>`, `FormArray<any>` or `FormGroup<any>` respectively to ensure that existing code will not cause typescript errors, .e.g:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst g = new FormGroup({\r\n  foo: new FormControl('test')\r\n});\r\ng.addControl('bar', new FormControl(5));\r\n// Error: Argument of type 'FormControl<number>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'FormControl<string>'\r\n\r\nconst c = new FormControl({foo: 10});\r\nc.setValue({foo:15, bar: 1});\r\n// Error: Argument of type '{ foo: number; bar: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ foo: number; }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the controls in this PR could be renamed to something else (e.g. `TypedFormControl`) and then have `FormControl`, be an alias for `TypedFormControl<any>`, in which case this PR would not introduce a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40772","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): make form controls strictly typed\" (#40772)"},{"Id":"805002230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-09T23:10:04","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"40771","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(http): complete the request on timeout","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40771","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(http): complete the request on timeout\" (#40771)"},{"Id":"804421469","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-09T22:25:31","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"40760","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to ab638724c","State":"closed","Body":"Updating [angular#11.2.x](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/11.2.x) from [cli-builds#11.2.x](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/tree/11.2.x).\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/829e1bae4...ab638724c):\n\n**Modified**\n- help/build.json\n- help/lint.json\n- help/new.json\n- help/serve.json\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/e98241829...ab638724c) since PR #40719:\n\n**Modified**\n- help/lint.json\n\n##\nCloses #40719","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40760","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to ab638724c\" (#40760)"},{"Id":"804976451","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-09T22:22:36","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"40770","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: clarify that support schedule is subject to change","State":"open","Body":"Initially raised due to #39509, this change updates our \"Support policy and schedule\" with the same disclaimer from the \"Release frequency\" section above.\r\n\r\nI debated with changing the actual numbers in this section.

So, no it is not a regression\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAccording to https://karma-runner.github.io/6.1/config/configuration-file.html \r\n\r\n> List of plugins to load. A plugin can be a string (in which case it will be required by Karma) or an inlined plugin - Object. By default, Karma loads all sibling NPM modules which have a name starting with karma-*.\r\n\r\nI have added `karma-coverage`  in `package.json` and installed it \r\nand added `karma-*` to the plugins config in `karma.conf.js` \r\nAngular cli ignores the installed package as it seems `karma-*` config is ignored while validating `karma-coverage` is installed\r\nIt works when in plugins configuration one of these is added\r\n`'karma-coverage'` or `require('karma-coverage')`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Add `karma-coverage` in `package.json` and install it (`npm install`)\r\n```\r\n\"karma-coverage\": \"^2.0.3\",\r\n```\r\n2. Add `'karma-*'` in `karma.conf.js` . Example:\r\n```\r\nplugins: [\r\n      'karma-*',\r\n      require('@angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma'),\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n3.

Go to the \"Creating groups of options\" demo on the [mat-select demo page](https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview#creating-groups-of-options).\r\n2. Navigate through the mat-select with groups using a screen-reader's page navigation. \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe group label should only be read once when the screen-reader navigates through the select options. The group label itself should never get focus, but its value should be read when the user navigates into the group.  \r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nChromeVox (issue): The screen-reader will read focus the group label and read the group name twice (\"Grass\" followed by \"Grass group\")\r\n\r\nMacOS VoiceOver + Chrome (issue): The screen-reader focuses the group as a whole and reads the group name (\"Grass, group 2 of 5\"). Then it progresses to the group label (\"Grass\") before going into the options.\r\n\r\nWindows JAWS + Chrome (ok): The screen-reader skips the label element and reads the group label when navigating into a group of options.\r\n\r\n#### Guidance\r\n\r\nmat-select is a listbox widget, and per the [WAI ARIA listbox guidance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#listbox), listboxes should \"contain children whose role is option or elements whose role is group which in turn contains children whose role is option.\" The `<label>` elements interfere with this pattern because they are not hidden from the a11y tree. \r\n\r\nWe can fix this by adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to the `<label>` element, so that while screenreaders will still announce the label text for the group (due to the aria-labelledby property on mat-optgroup), they will skip over the actual label element. Optionally, the `<label>` could be changed to a `<span>` to make it clear that the text is visual only and not carrying any special semantic meaning for the a11y tree. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21857","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-optgroup): <label> element should be skipped during screen-reader page navigation\" (#21857)"},{"Id":"804889859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-09T20:20:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21856","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): avoid interfering with external click listener","State":"open","Body":"Currently the datepicker toggle's `click` listener is on the inner `button` element and we call `stopPropagation` on it in order to prevent the form field from focusing the input.

I want to make `MyTable` component with infinity scroll. I wrap `cdk-virtual-scroll` inside my component\r\n```html\r\n@Component({ \r\nselector: 'table[my-table]',\r\ntemplate:\r\n`<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport [itemSize]=\"30\">\r\n    <ng-container *cdkVirtualFor=\"let item of _dataSource\">\r\n        <ng-template\r\n          [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"rowTemplate\"\r\n          [ngTemplateOutletContext]=\"{\r\n            $implicit: item\r\n          }\">\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>`\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it this way\r\n```html\r\n<my-table>\r\n    <ng-template #col1><td>1</td></ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template #col2><td>2</td></ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template #row><tr></tr></ng-template>\r\n</my-table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is one problem. I have several TemplateRefs `col1`, `col2`, `row`, but I need one `rowTemplate` which should be `row` with  `col1` and `col2` templates inside. There is no way to reach this in Angular. I can't merge templates as strings with HTML and I also can't extract the new `rowTemplate` from some temporary outlet.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not universal. We can add\r\n`TemplateRef.append`, `TemplateRef.prepend`, `TemplateRef.insert`, etc. methods to merge templates\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Or use something looks like React way for work with templates. Angular way is too complexive for creation components. That is why we still have no adequate multiselect, infinity-table etc. Angular components\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37960","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The way how to merge several TemplateRefs\" (#37960)"},{"Id":"652598767","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T20:04:35","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"37959","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): ensure file_system handles mixed Windows drives","State":"open","Body":"The `fs.relative()` method assumed that the file-system is a single tree,\r\nwhich is not the case in Windows, where you can have multiple drives,\r\ne.g. `C:`, `D:` etc.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes `fs.relative()` so that it no longer forces the result\r\nto be a `PathSegment` and then flows that refactoring through the rest of\r\nthe compiler-cli (and ngcc).

Click the `setValue(0)` button\r\n2. The **app** component calls  `setValue` on the FormControl with `emitEvent: false`\r\n3. The **ControlValueAccessor** `writeValue(value: string)` method is called on the custom FormField component (`my-input.component`)\r\n4. Writing the value is delegated to the **MatFormFieldControl** `value` setter\r\n5. The **MatFormFieldControl** `value` setter writes the value to the CodeMirror editor with `this._editor.setValue(value)`\r\n6. The `changes` [CodeMirror event](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#events) is triggered (it was added in `ngAfterViewInit`).\r\n7. The registered callback function is called with the updated value (`this._onChange(cm.getValue())`)\r\n8.

Too often we found ourselves in a situation where nobody understood what\r\nmotivated some of the changes and we needed more contextual info to know if the\r\nchange was correct, desirable, and still relevant (at a later point in time).\r\n\r\nWhen the limit was introduced, we needed to pick a minimum body length - given no\r\ndata, and frustration with even big changes being committed with just a words in\r\nthe subject (along the lines of \"fix(core): fixing a bug\"), we overcompensated\r\nand started off with a really high bar of minBodyLength set to 100 chars.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be impractical and created a big friction point in making valid\r\nchanges in the angular/angular repo, and in fact caused some of the refactorings\r\nand smaller changes to be either skipped or combined into other commits which\r\nincreased the burden for code reviewers.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the friction points can be seen in the number of PRs that fail to pass\r\nthe current lint check on the first try, but more importantly also in the \"creative\"\r\nwriting that some of the committers are forced to resort to in order to satisfy the\r\ncurrent checks.

Angular are often served from static website/file servers without a real web server. It'll be great if we can directly serve the compressed files without needing a web server. (Furthermore, some cloud app platforms do not seem to provide an easy way compress files on the fly. For example, aws application load balancer (level 7) does not seem to have such a functionality. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do it.)\r\n\r\nI've been using Angular on and off for some time now. One of the recurring problems for me has been the large bundle size of angular apps. In certain situations, 700~900kb framework size (uncompressed, including angular material) is just too big, and it makes angular unusable. I've been often struggling (without much success) to fit my whole application logic into a few hundred kilobytes. (I'm only talking about the main bundle size here, excluding lazy loaded modules.)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any client side framework doing this and I haven't really tried it, but I don't see why it cannot be easily done (at least, in theory).\r\n\r\nFirst, during the build process, create compressed doppelgangers for all content files (primarily, js files). For example, for `main-abc.js`, we create `main-abc.js.gz` (or something like that).\r\n\r\nWhen an angular app requests js files from a browser, add a content encoding header (gzip or br).  Then, the compressed doppelganger is served instead of the original js file. Not sure exactly how, at this point, though.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be instead of using js, simply use js.gzip or other compressed/binary files in the framework. The app simply downloads compressed js files and uncompress them before using them. This will require some kind of bootstrap.js to be loaded first so that it can download and uncompress, say, main.js.gz, etc. Again, I'm not entirely sure what the implications of doing this is.

On a new project I have issues to import interfaces automatically. For example I want to import this interface to my app.component.ts:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nexport interface TestInterface {\r\n    string: name;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\nIt is located in src/app/testInterface.ts. When i try to import it in my app.component.ts:\r\n<pre><code>\r\ntest: testInterface;\r\n</code></pre>\r\nI am using VSC and IntelliSense is not showing me the option to autoimport/import the interface anymore.

At first I thought I must be doing something very obvious wrong, but I was able to reproduce the problem with a very simple component using the out-of-the-box configuration generated by `ng new --strict` at the latest version.\r\n\r\nI searched online, and I was surprised to be unable to find any references to this problem. I did find a couple of similar-looking issues where errors in a template did not result in the test failures one would expect, but these are for non-existent HTML elements:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36171\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36430\r\n\r\nSo either this is a different but similar-looking problem, or these previously-reported problems are broader than these existing issues suggest. I tried setting `enableIvy = false` in my repro (see below), and it made no difference, so this problem does not appear to be Ivy-specific; since the issues above do appear to be Ivy-specific, I suspect this is a different problem.\r\n\r\nEither way, such significant discrepancies between test and non-test behaviours raise concerns about the usefulness of Angular tests for ensuring the code quality of components.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created the following GitHub repository to reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/amdw/templates-test-repro\r\n\r\nThere are two branches, `master` and `nonstrict`. In both cases, `ng serve` fails with a compile error, but `ng test` succeeds, despite the fact that the tests compile the broken `MyComponent` and make assertions about the contents of its DOM.\r\n\r\nI would expect both commands to fail with a compile error - or at the very least, this behavioural discrepancy should be prominently mentioned in testing-related documentation [such as this](https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-test-scenarios), with a description of how tests can be configured to have the same compilation behaviour as these other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch just uses the default compiler settings generated by `ng new --strict`. `MyComponent` has an incorrect HTML template: `myinput` can be undefined according to the component type signature, but one of its fields is being unconditionally dereferenced. Running `ng serve` or `ng build` results in a compile error, as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in src/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:7:27 - error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever `ng test` results in 100% success, with no mention in the logs that there is any problem at all.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this might be a problem with the new-ish `strictTemplates` settings, since that is the context in which I discovered the problem (I was trying to convert an existing application to use `strictTemplates`; I got to a stage where my tests were 100% green, and thought I must be nearly done, but when I ran `ng serve` I got a flood of errors caused by type-checking failures in my HTML templates).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did a little more experimentation and found that is not the case. The `nonstrict` branch switches `strictTemplates` and `strictInjectionParameters` to `false`, and introduces another template error, referencing a component attribute which does not even exist. Once again, `ng build` and `ng serve` result in the expected failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:6:39 - error TS2339: Property 'nonexistent' does not exist on type 'MycomponentComponent'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, once again, `ng test` results in 100% success.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nN/A - the problem is that tests pass when I believe they shouldn't.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of anything.

The problem with this is that the\r\nUrlResolver is designed to resolve URLs in general, and so for a path\r\nlike `/a/b/#c`, `#c` is treated as hash/fragment rather than as part\r\nof the path, which can lead to unexpected path resolution (f.x.,\r\n`resolve('a/b/#c/d.ts', './d.html')` would produce `'a/b/d.html'` rather\r\nthan the expected `'a/b/#c/d.html'`).\r\n\r\nThis commit resolves the issue by using Node's `path` module to resolve\r\nfile paths directly, which aligns more with how resources are resolved\r\nin the Ivy compiler.\r\n\r\nThe testing story here is not great, and the API for validating a file\r\npath could be a little bit prettier/robust. However, since the VE-based\r\nlanguage service is going into more of a \"maintenance mode\" now that\r\nthere is a clear path for the Ivy-based LS moving forward, I think it is\r\nokay not to spend too much time here.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/892\r\nCloses https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/1001","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39917","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(language-service): do not treat file URIs as general URLs\" (#39917)"},{"Id":"754221152","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-01T19:07:57","Actor":"ahnpnl","Number":"39903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Forms: better type for formState","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> This feature request is for @angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBetter type for `formState` arg for `FormControl`/`FormBuilder` constructor.

If we add a lazy loaded route, and in that NgModule we import `MatInputModule`, use MatInput in the lazy component and remove `MatListModule` from the main module, than the `@angular/forms` goes into the bundle of the lazy loaded module. Everything works great so far. Now, import `MatListModule` again in the main NgModule. The `@angular/forms` now goes to the main bundle.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/csbenjamin/issue-with-tree-shake\r\ncd issue-with-tree-shake\r\nnpm install\r\nng buil --prod\r\n```\r\nyou will see that `@angular/forms` goes to the main bundle, and it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@angular/material               10.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Javascript that should be in lazy loaded chunk is in the main chunk\" (#19527)"},{"Id":"754746707","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-01T21:40:06","Actor":"vicatcu","Number":"19526","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng build causes out of memory","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, this started happening when I migrated our server from Angular 9 to Angular 11, and from Node 10 to Node 14.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen I run `ng build` on my server, during the `Generating browser application bundles (phase: building)...` message, eventually I get an out of memory crash.

So I use `ng build --watch  --source-map --named-chunks` to develop the sites, everything works great, but after I upgrade to angular 11, all my scss source-map are wrong, my sites use bootstrap's scss, before upgrade, every project can show the exact source of any css rule. but after upgrade, all rules are come from the same scss file which is listed on angular.json.\r\n\r\nI've searched the

In my app I changed themes with lazy css replacement, like:\r\n````json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n              \"apps/.../src/styles.scss\",\r\n              {\r\n                \"input\": \"apps/.../src/dark-styles.scss\",\r\n                \"bundleName\": \"dark-styles\",\r\n                \"inject\": true,\r\n                \"lazy\": true\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n````\r\nHowever, after migration `lazy` is no longer in the schema. Also, when I remove it themes do not work - ok, it generated `dark-styles` but with hashing. I've tried to add `outputHashing: false` to it, but also not present in the schema. What should I do? I cannot find any migration reference in this topic.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \".styles[4]\" should NOT have additional properties(lazy).\r\n  Data path \".styles[4]\" should be string.\r\n  Data path \".styles[4]\" should match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.2\r\nNode: 14.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1100.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1100.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.1002.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.3.23\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.3.23\r\n@angular/cdk                       11.0.1\r\n@angular/material                  11.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.23\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1100.2\r\nng-packagr                         11.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.6.3\r\ntypescript                         4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19504","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Schema validation failed for Lazy CSS extraction in angular.json\" (#19504)"},{"Id":"752908200","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-29T14:41:59","Actor":"argelj289","Number":"19502","RawContent":null,"Title":"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter inaccurate coverage when source-map is false","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

I defined an array called links which contains 9 distinct items.\n2. I used the ngPlural directive to dynamically determine the pluralization case based on the length of the links array.\n3. I defined cases for =0, =1, =2, few and many in the component class.\n4. I also used the **i18nPlural** pipe to map the value 9 to a string according to locale-specific pluralization rules.\n5.

Furthermore, if the $index needs to be used, accessing it within the `@for` declaration doesn't allow the `let` usage for that variable.\n\nMore specifically, there currently isn't a \"clean\" way to do this within a `@for` loop block for an arbitrary number of calls:\n\n```\n@for (item of items; track item.id) {\n  @let _1 = myCalcFunction1($index);\n  @let _2 = myCalcFunction2();\n\n  Item #{{ idx }}: {{ item.name }} ( {{ myCalculatedValue1 }} - {{ myCalculatedValue2 }} )\n}\n``` \n\nAs demonstrated, the index may or may not matter - I simply want to call a function.\n\n# Example Use Case 1 - FormArrays\n\nImagine a `@for` loop is being used to iterate over a `FormArray`'s controls. The code-behind would have already spent  processing time looping to build the controls to begin with. Second, the template will already be iterating _again_ over the FormArray. If some _other_ action needs to be taken in the code-behind, it would be much more efficient to allow this to occur **while the template is already iterating the FormArray**:\n\n```\ndiv formArrayName=\"myFormArray\">\n  @for (ctl of myFormArray.controls; track ctl) {\n    @let _ = doSoethingWhileIteratingFormArray($index);\n  ...\n```\n\n# Example Use Case 2 - General Debugging, Stats, and API Calls\n\nThere may be debugging needs, statistics and usage tacking, API calls, or other use cases where we may want to simply call an arbitrary function while the code is iterating over an array already. This would vastly simplify the need for extra functions, index tracking, subscriptions, and general coordination.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEither allow discards to be used within `@for` and `@let` blocks or simply allow void function calls.\n\nDiscards in @for let block:\n\n```\n@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even, _ = myCalcFunction1(idx), _ = myCalcFunction2()) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nDiscard within @let block:\n\n```\n@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even) {\n  @let _ = myCalcFunction1(idx);\n  @let _ = myCalcFunction2();\n\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nSeparate block arguments without let:\n\n```\n@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even; myCalcFunction1($index), myCalcFunction2()) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing `@let` blocks to call functions that _must_ return a value. If we need to use the $index value, `let` cannot be used inside the `@for` declaration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60939","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow Arbitrary Function Calls from @for and @let blocks\" (#60939)"},{"Id":"3007135522","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-20T17:29:13","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60938","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update examples for i18n tokens","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60938","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update examples for i18n tokens\" (#60938)"},{"Id":"3007080447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-20T15:29:19","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60937","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: Run browsers tests without `platform-browser-dynamic`","State":"open","Body":"Use the regular `platform-browser` providers instead.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60937","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: Run browsers tests without `platform-browser-dynamic`\" (#60937)"},{"Id":"3007035813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-20T13:58:10","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60936","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(devtools): cleanup dependencies","State":"open","Body":"Removing `platform-browser-dynamic` because we don't need it anymore.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60936","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(devtools): cleanup dependencies\" (#60936)"},{"Id":"3007033047","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-20T13:52:11","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60935","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: replace the `platform-browser-dynamic` package where applicable","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60935","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: replace the `platform-browser-dynamic` package where applicable\" (#60935)"},{"Id":"3006668029","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T21:37:32","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60934","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): Extract type predicates from type guards.","State":"open","Body":"Previously they were extracted as `boolean`.\r\n\r\nExample: https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-60934-adev-prev-ezptkitm.web.app/api/core/isSignal\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60934","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): Extract type predicates from type guards.\" (#60934)"},{"Id":"3006651515","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T20:53:22","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60933","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update docs centered on NgModules","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60933","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update docs centered on NgModules\" (#60933)"},{"Id":"3006647237","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T20:41:08","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60932","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix NG2800 rendering","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60932","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: fix NG2800 rendering\" (#60932)"},{"Id":"3006643147","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T20:29:56","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60931","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Update creating libraries to the current recommendations","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60931","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: Update creating libraries to the current recommendations\" (#60931)"},{"Id":"3006638302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T20:16:41","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60930","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: format `RouterUpgradeInitializer` usage notes","State":"open","Body":"This commit also adds a standalone example\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60930","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: format `RouterUpgradeInitializer` usage notes\" (#60930)"},{"Id":"3006632828","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-19T20:02:32","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60929","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): remove style guide examples","State":"open","Body":"To merge when the style guide PR #60809 is merged.

input.required<number>();\n    double = computed(() => this.something() * 2);\n}\n```\nIn using this component, I noticed that in accessing `double()` through a template reference variable, usage order in my template matters:\n```html\n<!-- error \"Input is required but no value is available yet.\" on console: -->\nFoobar double: {{ foobar.double() }}\n\n<app-foobar [something]=\"42\" #foobar />\n\n<!-- same code as above, no error -->\nFoobar double: {{ foobar.double() }}\n```\nIt's not completely illogical for order to matter like this, but this behavior to me is quite unexpected.\n\n###

This experimental system is intended to provide support for investigation of future unit testing efforts within the Angular CLI. As this is experimental, no SemVer guarantees are provided, the API and behavior may change, and there may be unexpected behavior. Available test runners may be added or removed as well.\r\n\r\nThe setup is somewhat different than the previous unit-testing builders. It uses a similar mechanism to that of the `dev-server` and requires a `buildTarget` option. This allows the code building aspects of the unit-testing process to leverage pre-existing option values that are already defined for development. If differing option values are required for testing, an additional build target configuration specifically for testing can be used.\r\n\r\nThe current vitest support has multiple caveats including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* No watch support\r\n* `jsdom` based testing only (`jsdom` must be installed in the project)\r\n* Custom vitest configuration is not supported\r\n\r\nAn example configuration that would replace the `test` target for a project is as follows:\r\n```\r\n\"test\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular/build:unit-test\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n        \"tsConfig\":

Those browser artifacts might contain files with spaces. This is incompatible with the Bazel version we are using, so the inprocess runfile creation was a workaround for this— If we remove that flag, we might cause issues for Mac users.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options I think:\r\n\r\n1. drop the flag, and hope it doesn't break any runfile generation for browsers. I suspect it won't work...— alternatively try renaming browser files.\r\n\r\n2. keep the flag for now, and temporarily keep the disabled FS patches (needs to be manually specified by users)\r\n\r\n3. do solution (2) but once migration allows it, update to Bazel 7— so that the bug with inprocess resolution is nicely fixed.\r\n\r\nI think (3) is a good plan moving forward and we don't need any runfile tricks. In Bazel 8, the runfiles with space issue is also resolved— allowing us to drop the inprocess runfile creation as well (if we want).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30119","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: fix `bazel run` invocations of `js_binary/js_test`\" (#30119)"},{"Id":"2998911260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:17:46","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30113","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nEnsure that several previously omitted options are correctly passed to the Karma esbuild builder, improving consistency and expected behavior.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30113","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder\" (#30113)"},{"Id":"2999971186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:16:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30118","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30118","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release\" (#30118)"},{"Id":"2999813410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:13:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30117","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30117","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.\" (#30117)"},{"Id":"2999379499","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T11:42:38","Actor":"geromegrignon","Number":"30116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nA similar way React CRA app has a counter button in the initial boilerplate, doing quite the same for Angular `ng new` AppComponent boilerplate could be a good opportunity to promote Signals.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nBased on the current boilerplate content, it could be a 'like' button, each click incrementing a related counter.\n\nIt would be a simple way to show a basic Signal usage, even if deleted after all.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example\" (#30116)"},{"Id":"2999068602","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T09:39:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30115","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`","State":"open","Body":"Early exits and reduce optional chaining.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`\" (#30115)"},{"Id":"2998803026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T08:43:03","Actor":"timothyBrake","Number":"30111","RawContent":null,"Title":"HMR Triggers Full Page Reload When Using i18n in HTML Template","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using Angular with Vite for development, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works as expected for standard HTML templates. However, if an i18n attribute is present in the template (e.g., `<h1 i18n=\"@@greetings\">Title</h1>`), editing the template triggers a full page reload instead of a hot update.

Open the Chrome DevTools Network tab and watch for GET requests for chunk files.\n4. In src/app/app.component.html add `<h1>Hello world!</h1>`\n5. HMR is working — only the component is fetched via a GET request.\n6. Now change the same file to include i18n `<h1 i18n=\"@@greetings\">Hello world!</h1>`\n7. HMR is not working — a full page refresh is triggered, and the entire app reloads instead of just updating the component.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your

to19.2.10 some of our Services are a created wrong, the included import with a concrete hash in the `.d.ts` which obviously tends to compile time problems if the user does not also have the exact Angular Material Version in his project.\n\nI created a “minimal” repo, based on our library project structure.\n\nI also saw other Issues with a similar problem (also with 19.2.4), but it appears that this is different because it still happens with the current version of Angular Material.\n\n\n\n  \n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/DerAlbertCom/AngularMaterialBug\n\nReproduce\n\n1.  cd ng-mono\n2. npm install\n3. npm run lib:build\n4. look at the generated file\n5.

the general import, without the hash, like in all Version before 19.2.4.\n\n```ts\nexport declare class DummyConfirmationService {\n    private readonly matDialog;\n    confirm$<T = boolean>(data?:

i0.ɵɵFactoryDeclaration<DummyConfirmationService, never>;\n    static ɵprov: i0.ɵɵInjectableDeclaration<DummyConfirmationService>;\n}\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe d.ts file is generated with the Hash in the import, this happens since Version 19.2.4\n```ts\nexport declare class DummyConfirmationService {\n    private readonly matDialog;\n    confirm$<T = boolean>(data?:

However, when using the StartDelay configuration, there is no event or mechanism to detect when dragging becomes possible after the delay completes but before movement begins. This leads to a gap in functionality where developers cannot hook into the moment dragging becomes active.\n\nSuggested Solution\nIntroduce an additional event (e.g., cdkDragActivated) that fires once the StartDelay has elapsed and dragging becomes possible, regardless of movement. This would enable more granular control and improve the developer experience when working with delayed drag-and-drop functionality.\n\n\nRelated Code/Documentation\nThe cdkDragStarted event: [Drag and Drop Documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview#drag-and-drop)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would be particularly useful for scenarios where UI feedback or logic needs to occur as soon as dragging is activated (after the delay), but before the user moves the draggable item.\n\nFor example the user wants to indicate that a element is now draggable with an outline.

This should be supported in `NgOptimizedImage` to provide a cleaner UI when images fail to load properly.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAllow us to pass an alternative url as an `@Input` to the `NgOptimizedImage`, and set metadata on the `img` element so developers can know if the placeholder image is rendered or not, and style it accordingly if needed. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWith the new control-flow syntax, perhaps it could be possible to have something like `@image/@error` blocks, allowing you to pass custom elements altogether if the image fails to load. This way would allow more control than the previously suggested idea. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@image {\r\n  <img ngSrc=\"cat.jpg\" />\r\n}\r\n@error {\r\n  <my-fallback-component>\r\n    <app-icon icon=\"broken-image\" />\r\n    The image could not be loaded :(\r\n  </my-fallback-component>\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53617","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error handling for NgOptimizedImage\" (#53617)"},{"Id":"2044767137","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T09:58:29","Actor":"jon9090","Number":"53603","RawContent":null,"Title":"add support for stylex","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nplease add support for [stylex](https://github.com/facebook/stylex) \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nn/a\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nn/a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53603","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"add support for stylex\" (#53603)"},{"Id":"2046081922","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T08:58:51","Actor":"wangyingang","Number":"53615","RawContent":null,"Title":"The page links on the angular.dev website are broken","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the `Command Reference` for `Angular CLI`, the page shows `Page Not Found`.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/commands\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1720\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-18 at 16 34 36\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/783997/02030f29-6b8a-4a70-aefb-10dc7c9b5747\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome Version 120.0.6099.109 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- OS: macOS 14.2 (23C64)\r\n- Device: MacBook Pro Apple M2 Max\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53615","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The page links on the angular.dev website are broken\" (#53615)"},{"Id":"2045810663","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T08:02:47","Actor":"ebmtz","Number":"53614","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular.dev/cli/commands links to \"Not Found\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/commands is linking to \"Not Found\"\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/commands\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nAngular CLI reference\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nClicked on \"Command Reference\" link in https://angular.dev/tools/cli, which re-directed to https://angular.dev/cli/commands , but the page is not found.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/5950349/90c064da-4e52-43e2-a3ef-45bebe572cbb)\r\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53614","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"angular.dev/cli/commands links to \"Not Found\"\" (#53614)"},{"Id":"2045663916","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T03:29:36","Actor":"srcarlos","Number":"53613","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Fixes templateUrl to template in Reactive Forms tutorial","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

the edges 'Version & indexOfThis' into one numeric value using bitwise operators.\r\n\r\nI've tested this against this benchsuite https://github.com/leonelvsc/js-reactivity-benchmark/tree/patch2

`epoch++` should be limited to `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`\r\n\r\nThe only downside is the limitation of bitwise operators to 32 bits. This, of course, could be overcome if we want to use all the 53 bits of `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` with `Math.pow(2,n)` but i'm sure that it would be less efficient.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n[EDIT] i've managed to just push 1 numeric value creating a globalRefRegistry and assigning an objectId at node creation with BigInt on >=es2020 , but is so much slower \r\n\r\n64 bits:\r\n\r\n- 14 bits for version\r\n-

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #51323 \r\n\r\nAs described in the issue, the compiler can't find named entities that do not end with `;` and contain digits, you can see some examples of this type of named entities in the print presented at the issue or at the [HTML spec for named entities](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html).\r\nRight now the process to find a named entity states that it will always start with the character `&` and end with the character `;`, so it will get all the text between those two characters and check if it exists in the entities hash map, if so, it will consider it as an entity and add the associate character, otherwise it will consider the character `&` as a normal text and continues with the flow.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nWith my proposal, we have these criterias for named entities:\r\n1. An entity will always start with the character `&`\r\n2. They have a maximum length (this will be calculated dynamically, it isn't hard-coded, it iterates over the entities hash map and finds the largest named entity and returns its length)\r\n3. The only valid characters are: `&`, `;`, `a-b`, `A-B` or `0-9`\r\n4. When finds a character `;` will not consider any further characters as part of the named entity, it will end the search\r\n\r\nSo when we find an `&` character, we iterate over each character until it doesn't meet the criterias above, and compare the string to the entities hash map to see if we have a match\r\n\r\n**Ex 1:**\r\n**Input:** `&amp`\r\n`&`      **->** We found the start of a possible entity, let's iterate over the next characters to see if it's a named entity.\r\n`&a`     **->** Doesn't match with any named entity but still pass the criterias, so let's move to next character.\r\n`&am`    **->** Doesn't match with any named entity but still pass the criterias, so let's move to next character.\r\n`&amp`   **->** Matches with the named entity `&amp`, it has no more characters left so we consider this match as the named entity and associate the mapped character to it.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to consider that we can have more than one match within the process, in this case we need to consider the longest match as the final named entity.\r\n\r\n**Ex 2:**\r\n**Input:** `&amp;`\r\n`&`      **->** We found the start of a possible entity, let's iterate over the next characters to see if it's a named entity.\r\n`&a`     **->** Doesn't match with any named entity but still pass the criterias, so let's move to next character.\r\n`&am`    **->** Doesn't match with any named entity but still pass the criterias, so let's move to next character.\r\n`&amp`   **->** Matches with the named entity &amp, there are still characters left so we consider this as the possible match for the named entity and move to the next character.\r\n`&amp;` **->** Match with the named entity `&amp;`, it has no more characters left, but we have found two named entities: `&amp;` and `&amp`, we will consider the largest match as the final one and associate the mapped character to it(`&amp;`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53597","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): adjust the process of finding named entities\" (#53597)"},{"Id":"2044500544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T23:49:01","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"53595","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): Create a new FakePlatformLocation.","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The issue isn't Playwright related. I think the problem might be related with the fact that when running the `Playwright` tests, when they fail, several files are being generated inside the `./tests` directory and that somehow is breaking the file watcher. [See this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/28632#issuecomment-1857980050).\r\n- I can't replicate this issue if I use the prerelease version of Angular CLI, version `17.1.0-next.2`, by doing:\r\n```\r\nng update @angular/cli@next\r\n```\r\n- Using the demo app, **BEFORE** updating to @angular/cli@next, **ANY** file I add/delete to the `./tests` folder was triggering an app rebuild and **AFTER the update that no longer happens**. For instance, adding an image that is not used by the app to the `./tests` folder would result in this output:\r\n```\r\nNo output file changes.\r\n\r\nUnchanged output files: 3\r\nApplication bundle generation complete. [0.068 seconds]\r\n```\r\n- I initially thought this was related with `Playwright` so I first opened the issue at https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/28632.\r\n- I then thought this was related with #26633 and [I left a comment](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26633#issuecomment-1858037467) there.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26686","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Loss of app rebuild on app change using ng 17 with esbuild+vite\" (#26686)"},{"Id":"2044531128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-16T00:52:52","Actor":"rgant","Number":"26690","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incomplete Angular Karma Jasmine specs no longer fail on fit/fdescribe","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv14\n\n### Description\n\nMy build system didn't reject a recent PR committed with a focused test fdescribe.

But that is just how the default Angular v17 does, so I assume it isn't part of this.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.6\r\nNode: 20.10.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.6\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.6\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nStackOverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77647063/incomplete-angular-karma-jasmine-specs-no-longer-fail-on-fit-fdescribe","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26690","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Incomplete Angular Karma Jasmine specs no longer fail on fit/fdescribe\" (#26690)"},{"Id":"2043595227","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T15:34:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26685","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): re-add `-d` alias for `--dry-run`","State":"closed","Body":"This got accidentally deleted during the transition to yargs.\r\n\r\nCloses #26496\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26685","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): re-add `-d` alias for `--dry-run`\" (#26685)"},{"Id":"2043580554","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T15:30:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26684","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): remove no longer relevant regexps from `ng version` checks","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nBazel and NgUniversal packages information is not needed in version 17.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26684","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): remove no longer relevant regexps from `ng version` checks\" (#26684)"},{"Id":"2043504554","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T12:36:10","Actor":"Danonlylane","Number":"26682","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 14 is fine & but Angular  15 build fails when importing css in source code from node modules.","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, run, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I upgraded from Angular 13 to Angular 14, There's been a mistake.\r\n\r\n![cec49dd2-b10e-4e65-b82c-02c6a6c5dc3f](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/53202530/51afbbd5-9932-43c2-9db0-51b358a967d2)\r\n\r\nI solved it in the following way\r\n```js\r\n// angular.json > projects > {project_name} > architect > build > options\r\n  \"styles\": [\r\n    \"src/index.less\",\r\n    \"src/styles.css\",\r\n    \"node_modules/@cloudscope/core/ui/mask/mask.css\", // add\r\n    \"node_modules/@cloudscope/core/ui/message/tips.css\", // add\r\n    \"node_modules/@cloudscope/core/ui/regionTree/regionTree.css\" // add\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nBut when I upgraded to Angular 15, the problem reappeared.

The ability to dynamically update attributes such as mat-fab, and others that significantly alter the layout or styling, is currently limited post-initialization.\r\n\r\nThe existing workarounds for this limitation are often complex and can significantly impact performance.\r\n\r\n**Current Workarounds and Their Limitations**: \r\n\r\nI have attempted several approaches, including:\r\n\r\n1. **Manually setting the attribute using Renderer2 and ElementRef**: While this method provides direct control over component attributes, it can lead to verbose and complex code, especially when dealing with multiple attributes and components. Moreover, it requires careful management of Angular's Lifecycle, adding a layer of complexity in ensuring that attribute changes align with Angular's change detection and update cycles.\r\n    \r\n2. **Creating a Proxy around the component element to intercept and apply attribute changes**: This approach offers a degree of flexibility and a more elegant solution for attribute manipulation. However, it adds an additional layer of complexity and can be challenging to manage across different components. Additionally, the reliance on Metaprogramming techniques, which are less familiar to many developers, can hinder maintainability and reduce the ease of updates.\r\n    \r\n3. **Forcing the component to re-render by updating a key value within an `*ngIf` directive**: This approach, although effective in certain scenarios, can lead to performance issues. It involves destroying and recreating components, which is inefficient and resource-intensive, especially for large and interactive UIs. Such a method goes against Angular's philosophy of efficient, reactive UI updates and can drastically affect the user experience in more complex applications.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIn many web applications, the UI needs to respond dynamically to user actions and other application states. For example, a button may need to change from a standard button (`mat-button`) to a floating action button (`mat-fab`) based on a user's selection or a specific state in the application. \r\n\r\nCurrently, such dynamic changes require workarounds that are less efficient and potentially less performant. Having native support for this functionality would streamline the development process, reduce the need for custom solutions, and align Angular Material more closely with dynamic and reactive design patterns.\r\n\r\nAnother significant use case for this feature is the **creation of interfaces designed to configure other software interfaces.** \r\n\r\nSuch UIs need to dynamically respond to runtime changes efficiently, adapting their appearance and functionality on the fly. \r\n\r\nThis feature would be particularly valuable in scenarios where developers are building highly interactive and configurable environments, eliminating the need to prepare static lists of elements. Instead, developers could leverage Angular Material to dynamically adapt UI components like buttons to varying requirements and states, enhancing the overall flexibility and user experience.\r\n\r\nThis capability is crucial in modern software development, where adaptability and responsiveness are key to meeting diverse and evolving user needs and expectations.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the continuous efforts of the Angular Material team in advancing the framework and thank you for considering this feature request.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhanced Support for Dynamically Setting Attributes Across Angular Material Components (e.g. `mat-fab`, to Change Button Variants at Runtime).\" (#28292)"},{"Id":"2044274021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T19:33:42","Actor":"tomasdev","Number":"28291","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatButton): FAB with disabled state using alpha on background collisions","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<img width=\"138\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-15 at 2 33 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/components/assets/364033/8c95857b-c68e-44f9-b14b-1c96c639b860\">\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the disabled state background color is defined with alpha, FAB collide with page contents when disabled.

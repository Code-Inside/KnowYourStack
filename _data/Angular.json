I'm having issue with figuring out some Angular behaviour and it seems no one is able to answer my question.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to set up Auth0 with my Angular app, however when Auth0 redirects back to my Angular app after successful authentication it tries to redirect to `http://localhost:4200/tracker?code=fK0frbSIkXuHAE28&state=cjc4WHdUSnU4U0pSeDlwMjc3c3NJZ0MxcGpsZ3dwX2h2eX42dEJacDJCWg%3D%3D`\r\n\r\nThis page isn't allowed to load and then almost instantly redirects back to `http://localhost:4200`\r\n\r\nIf I try to manually navigate to `http://localhost:4200/tracker?code=fK0frbSIkXuHAE28&state=cjc4WHdUSnU4U0pSeDlwMjc3c3NJZ0MxcGpsZ3dwX2h2eX42dEJacDJCWg%3D%3D`, the app will again force the browser back to `http://localhost:4200`\r\n\r\nHowever if I try to manually navigate to `http://localhost:4200/tracker?code=fK0frbSIkXuHAE28&`, without the `state` parameter in the URL, angular allows the route to activate\r\n\r\nI have Auth0 set up so that it will automatically redirect to `http://localhost:4200/tracker` after Authentication, but this redirect being caused by angular is breaking the authentication flow. \r\n\r\nI can see that separate navigation events are being raised by the router, so it's obviously Angular causing the redirect. \r\n\r\nDo I need to specifically state the params that are expected by the route or something?

I have a `FormGroup`, which in turn has a `FormArray` control:\r\n\r\n```lang=typescript\r\nreadonly form = this.formBuilder.group({\r\n  array: this.formBuilder.array([])\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. This is how I use the form in the template:\r\n\r\n```lang=html\r\n<form [formGroup]=\"form\">\r\n  <label *ngFor=\"let item of form['controls'].array['controls']\">\r\n    Name:\r\n    <input [formControl]=\"item\">\r\n  </label>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I subscribe to `FormArray.valueChanges`:\r\n\r\n```lang=typescript\r\nthis.form.get(\"array\").valueChanges.subscribe(value => {\r\n  console.log(value);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. I push a new control to the `FormArray` using `.push()`:\r\n\r\n```lang=typescript\r\n(this.form.get(\"array\") as FormArray).push(\r\n  this.formBuilder.control('test')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. `FormArray.valueChanges` fires as expected, I get my value which is:\r\n\r\n```lang=typescript\r\n['test']\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Here's the weird part. If I set a short timeout and try to read the array value using `FormArray.value`, I get a different array. It looks the same (`['test']`), but it is a different array. This only happens once, and after that the value remains stable. See:\r\n\r\n```lang=typescript\r\narrayControl.valueChanges.subscribe(value => {\r\n  console.log(1, arrayControl.value === value); // TRUE - expected, I get the current value\r\n\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    const z = arrayControl.value;\r\n    console.log(2, z === value); // FALSE - UNEXPECTED, the value changed!\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      console.log(3, arrayControl.value === z); // TRUE - the value no longer changes (the timeout is 1s)\r\n    }, 1000);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is related to the form directives. If I use an empty template, then all three log statements print TRUE. Actually, it is enough to remove `<input [formControl]=\"item\">` from the template to get the expected behaviour. It is also irrelevant whether there is a parent form group (`<form [formGroup]=\"form\">`) or not.\r\n\r\nApparently the `.value` field is _not_ a getter, so it must be that the value is explicitly changed by the directives.\r\n\r\nI am able to demonstrate the same problem with `FormGroup`s.\r\n\r\n## Why is this a problem?\r\n\r\nI have a rather complex form, where the data entered in one part of the form creates a basis for selection in other parts of the form. These \"other parts\" are components which take the array value as an input:\r\n\r\n```lang=html\r\n<app-custom-form-component\r\n    formControlName=\"selection\"\r\n    [options]=\"form['controls'].options.value\"\r\n></app-custom-form-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this unexpected `value` change, the `OnChange` logic is executed twice in the custom component. I also get an `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` as a side-effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`FormArray` example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-aq9smo?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts.\r\n\r\n`FormGroup` example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-xserr3?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"angular\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^11.0.8\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"^6.6.3\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.1.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.11.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\r\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.1100.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~11.0.4\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.6.0\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~3.6.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^1.5.0\",\r\n    \"protractor\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~8.3.0\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~6.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.0.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41245","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FormArray value changes after valueChanges fires.\" (#41245)"},{"Id":"833907496","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-17T15:25:40","Actor":"DzmVasileusky","Number":"41244","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support dollar sign character in output names","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/core\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, but not sure from what version it was broken.

**compiler-cli:** introduce HttpContext request context ([#&#8203;25751](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/25751)) ([1644d64](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1644d64398491d4a324a5eee492d1fd37df52a01))\n-   **core:** drop support for TypeScript 4.0 and 4.1 ([#&#8203;41158](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41158)) ([fa04894](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fa048948be75c30dafebda69efbeb81776460500))\n-   **core:** support TypeScript 4.2 ([#&#8203;41158](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41158)) ([59ef409](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/59ef40988e94f3173134368bc7d4e2726cdd8455))\n-   **ngcc:** support

  **ngcc:** support `__spreadArray` helper as used by TypeScript 4.2 ([#&#8203;41201](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41201)) ([7b1214e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7b1214eca2dd2f09e723a46bed857fcb7d40bc0b)), closes [microsoft/TypeScript#&#8203;41523](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/41523) [#&#8203;40394](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/40394)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **common:** remove unused methods from DomAdapter ([#&#8203;41102](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41102)) ([3c66b10](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3c66b100dd6f05f53740f596c5eadb999c27c9c4))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **core:** Switching default of `emitDistinctChangesOnlyDefaultValue`\n    which changes the default behavior and may cause some applications which\n    rely on the incorrect behavior to fail.\n\n`emitDistinctChangesOnly` flag has also been deprecated and will be\nremoved in a future major release.\n\nThe previous implementation would fire changes `QueryList.changes.subscribe`\nwhenever the `QueryList` was recomputed. This resulted in an artificially\nhigh number of change notifications, as it is possible that recomputing\n`QueryList` results in the same list. When the `QueryList` gets recomputed\nis an implementation detail, and it should not be the thing that determines\nhow often change event should fire.\n\nUnfortunately, fixing the behavior outright caused too many existing\napplications to fail. For this reason, Angular considers this fix a\nbreaking fix and has introduced a flag in `@ContentChildren` and\n`@ViewChildren`, that controls the behavior.\n\n    export class QueryCompWithStrictChangeEmitParent {\n      @&#8203;ContentChildren('foo', {\n        // This option is the new default with this change.\n        emitDistinctChangesOnly: true,\n      })\n      foos!: QueryList<any>;\n    }\n\nFor backward compatibility before v12\n`emitDistinctChangesOnlyDefaultValue` was set to `false. This change\nchanges the default to`true\\`.\n\n#### 11.2.6 (2021-03-17)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **core:** remove duplicated EMPTY_OBJ constant ([#&#8203;41153](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41153)) ([fa97166](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fa97166361b17802f8d1771e18b47ac55a117a53))\n-   **forms:** properly handle the change to the FormGroup shape ([#&#8203;40829](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/40829)) ([60ac964](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/60ac9643334b83b6b720afd1b7d7fadf02c4e7fc)), closes [#&#8203;13788](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/13788)\n-   **localize:** render correct closing tag placeholder names in XLIFF 2 ([#&#8203;41152](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41152)) ([7dbb550](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7dbb550946031d212b334b9e805e198232bc933b)), closes [#&#8203;41142](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41142)\n-   **localize:** trim extracted `equiv-text` values ([#&#8203;41180](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41180)) ([ed6c09a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ed6c09ae45faa598b505c68bd68fe0d1ba3300c4)), closes [#&#8203;41176](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41176)\n-   **ngcc:** do not compile JavaScript sources if typings-only processing is repeated ([#&#8203;41209](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41209)) ([be050b2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/be050b2582eed2ad036fb4dd679926a146e17264)), closes [#&#8203;41198](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41198)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **forms:** avoid direct references to the `Validators` class ([#&#8203;41189](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41189)) ([#&#8203;41220](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41220)) ([804b6b6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/804b6b66853aa53f446b3e9c3cb921ae8cb794c2))\n-   **forms:** make `FormBuilder` class tree-shakable ([#&#8203;41126](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41126)) ([ffc93e0](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ffc93e0946dc7c5a2a64a25a97dbae551b3ffbec))\n-   **forms:** make `RadioControlRegistry` class tree-shakable ([#&#8203;41126](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41126)) ([6414590](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6414590f8d09d5d33a9022b023e025fc1452f5b5))\n-   **forms:** make built-in ControlValueAccessors more tree-shakable ([#&#8203;41146](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41146)) ([#&#8203;41197](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41197)) ([5908eda](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5908eda7c11ebff169d07598e54f62d7e35f6580))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components</summary>\n\n### [`v11.2.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1125-fauxfur-falafel-2021-03-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/11.2.4...11.2.5)\n\n##### material\n\n|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| bug fix | **select:** float label on focus if there's a placeholder ([#&#8203;19517](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/19517)) ([77b6a6d860b5a0879fe584323bfb50df33d644d0](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/77b6a6d860b5a0879fe584323bfb50df33d644d0)), closes [#&#8203;19514](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/19514) |\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This means that in version 17 and earlier the behavior is like eventCoalescing to false -- won't scroll to the top\". \r\nso I will say \"no scroll to the top\" is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 18, Angular sets eventCoalescing to true by default, and zoneless mode is expected to become the default in the future. This change in behavior could cause problems. If the Angular Team does not consider this a bug, it should be clearly highlighted in the documentation.\r\n\r\nWhy it happened? (I guess)\r\nAfter insertView, ChangeDetectionScheduler.notify is triggered, but refreshView does not run immediately. instead, it runs after a setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame. In the example above, the template contains an @for. Due to the delay, the content is removed first, and then the browser renders. At this point, the @for hasn't executed yet, so there are no elements in the body, causing scrollTop jump to 0. After the timeout, the @for runs, but scrollTop can no longer automatically return to its previous position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/keatkeat87/ng-routing-zone-v18.git\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.0\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57460","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Routing Bug - eventCoalescing true cause scroll to top\" (#57460)"},{"Id":"2475931577","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-20T15:24:10","Actor":"joshuamillerhexagon","Number":"57459","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animation of Child component is not firing when component is loaded from lazy loaded module","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am upgrading from Angular 12 to 18.

An explanation of the background can be found here: https://rollupjs.org/faqs/#why-do-additional-imports-turn-up-in-my-entry-chunks-when-code-splitting\r\n\r\nApparently, it should be possible to prevent this hoisting by configuring the `hoistTransitiveImports` option for rollup: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-hoisttransitiveimports\r\n\r\nYet, it appears that Angular won't let me add any custom configuration options for rollup. So, I wonder if hoisting of transitive imports shouldn't be disabled by default when building libraries in order to avoid these unnecessary warnings.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I fail to produce a minimal example of a library that would be split into chunks and have its imports hoisted.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n▲ [WARNING] Ignoring this import because \"dist/sioux/app/fesm2022/sioux-app.mjs\" was marked as having no side effects [ignored-bare-import]\r\n\r\n    dist/sioux/admin/fesm2022/sioux-admin-acl-editor.component-CbLkugjk.mjs:21:7:\r\n      21 │ import '@sioux/app';\r\n         ╵        ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  \"sideEffects\" is false in the enclosing \"package.json\" file:\r\n\r\n    dist/sioux/app/package.json:59:2:\r\n      59 │   \"sideEffects\": false\r\n         ╵   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.3.3\r\nNode: 20.12.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.3\r\nng-packagr                      17.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28221","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Transitive dependencies hoisted by rollup cause warnings when importing libraries with multiple chunks\" (#28221)"},{"Id":"2472633556","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-20T12:12:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28226","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For example, `import fs from \"fs\"` can also be written `import fs from \"node:fs\"`. This only works with certain newer versions of node, so esbuild removes it when you target older versions of node such as with `--target=node14` so that your code still works. With the way esbuild's platform-specific feature compatibility table works, this was added by saying that only newer versions of node support this feature. However, that means that a target such as `--target=node18,es2022` removes the `node:` prefix because none of the `es*` targets are known to support this feature. This release adds the support for the `node:` flag to esbuild's internal compatibility table for `es*` to allow you to use compound targets like this:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import fs from 'node:fs'\n    fs.open\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --format=esm --platform=node --target=node18,es2022)\n    import fs from \"fs\";\n    fs.open;\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --format=esm --platform=node --target=node18,es2022)\n    import fs from \"node:fs\";\n    fs.open;\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a panic when using the CLI with invalid build flags if `--analyze` is present ([#&#8203;3834](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3834))\n\n    Previously esbuild's CLI could crash if it was invoked with flags that aren't valid for a \"build\" API call and the `--analyze` flag is present. This was caused by esbuild's internals attempting to add a Go plugin (which is how `--analyze` is implemented) to a null build object. The panic has been fixed in this release.\n\n-   Fix incorrect location of certain error messages ([#&#8203;3845](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3845))\n\n    This release fixes a regression that caused certain errors relating to variable declarations to be reported at an incorrect location. The regression was introduced in version 0.18.7 of esbuild.\n\n-   Print comments before case clauses in switch statements ([#&#8203;3838](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3838))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will attempt to print comments that come before case clauses in switch statements. This is similar to what esbuild already does for comments inside of certain types of expressions. Note that these types of comments are not printed if minification is enabled (specifically whitespace minification).\n\n-   Fix a memory leak with `pluginData` ([#&#8203;3825](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3825))\n\n    With this release, the build context's internal `pluginData` cache will now be cleared when starting a new build. This should fix a leak of memory from plugins that return `pluginData` objects from `onResolve` and/or `onLoad` callbacks.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.21.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4210)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.20.0...v4.21.0)\n\n*2024-08-18*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Add option to configure directory for virtual modules when preserving modules ([#&#8203;5602](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5602))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5602](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5602): feat: introduce the virtualDirname option to customize the virtual directory name ([@&#8203;TrickyPi](https://togithub.com/TrickyPi))\n-   [#&#8203;5607](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5607): chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v8 (major) ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot], [@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5608](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5608): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5611): chore: fix the `noConflict` option in REPL.

service workers (504) after migrating to @angular-devkit/build-angular:application from :browser","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv17\n\n### Description\n\nBackground: Mostly vanilla angular application using PWA since Angular ~5 doing normal `ng update`s.\r\n\r\nService worker only being used for caching static assets and serving them offline\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to v18 I accepted the migration to `:application` - the schematic did not migrate the `build.configurations.production.serviceWorker` from a boolean (`true`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng serve --proxy-config proxy-dev.conf.json  --configuration production\r\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must be string.\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrough trial and error I discovered the \"correct\"  new value for the `build.configurations.production.serviceWorker` field: `ngsw-config.json` (aside -- FR: link the schema from [the migration docs](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration)? 🙏)\r\n\r\nThe service worker appeared to fetch and serve assets as expected **but** just before promoting from canary to prod I did an extra QA pass (it was sus that my `angular.json` wasn't properly migrated) and discovered that refreshing while offline now reported a 504\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20240818_113433](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ba9b97-6140-49e7-a469-215318d4aa48)\r\n\r\nThe above 504 is being served from the Service Worker and it appears the handling logic isn't serving the cached copy on network error anymore.\r\n\r\n* ⛔ Running my v18 build locally with `ng serve --configuration production` shared the same issue\r\n* ✅ Reverting to v17 and it again worked as expected.\r\n* ✅ Making a new v18 build with `angular.json` reverted to the v17 version (using `:build` rather than `:application`) works as expected when using `ng serve --configuration production`\r\n* ⛔ Making a new v18 build with the reverted `angular.json` and substituting `:build` for `:build-esbuild` failed to register any service worker \r\n  * This seems like a separate issue, the `:application` build does still register the SW and serve assets\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI assume (but have not tested) this would affect any PWA-enabled repo upgraded from v17 to v18 which performs the migration.\r\n\r\nI have a workaround that allows me to upgrade to v18 (using the old & busted webpack builder)\r\n\r\nBelow are the relevant files and commands I

this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nAngular 16\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nServing a PWA with the default dev server is now broken.\r\nSpecifically, the vite dev server apparently mangles the files emitted by the previous build steps, but does not recompute the hashes stored in `ngsw.json`.\r\nThis results in the service worker being installed, but not really serving any file.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to use the \"old\" (webpack-based) dev server that is apparently not affected by this.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nBasically the steps are:\r\n - create a new app `ng new`\r\n - make it a PWA `ng add @angular/pwa`\r\n - configure it to start the service worker in dev\r\n - start it `ng serve`\r\n - open it in the browser http://localhost:4200/ and wait a few seconds (so that the service worker can initialize)\r\n - check the sw state at http://localhost:4200/ngsw/state\r\n\r\nA full repo reproducing the issue is https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro\r\nFrom this repo, the needed steps are:\r\n - choose the commit to start from (https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro/commit/a524b1a36049d77690ac6f37c14a56d1d501a042 to check the issue with vite, https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro/commit/6207a68be012eb680e000ff02f82b65c1d6b4b8d to compare with webpack)\r\n - install the dependencies `npm install`\r\n - start the server `ng serve`\r\n - open the app in the browser http://localhost:4200/ and wait a few seconds (so that the service worker can initialize)\r\n - check the sw state at http://localhost:4200/ngsw/state\r\n\r\nNote that the repo contains both a revision that reproduces the issue and one that configures the build to use webpack for comparison, to show that in that case the dev server works as intended.\r\nAlso note that to properly check what is going on, you might want to clear the browser state by opening the inspector and (in Chrome-based browsers) going to Application -> Storage -> Clear site data\r\n\r\nWith the

Got:'} $args-count + 1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if $version == 0 {\r\n    @return m2-inspection.get-theme-color($theme, $args...);\r\n  }\r\n  @else if $version == 1 {\r\n    @if $args-count == 1 {\r\n      @return _get-theme-role-color($theme, $args...);\r\n    }\r\n    @else if $args-count == 2 {\r\n      @return _get-theme-palette-color($theme, $args...);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  @else {\r\n    @error #{'Unrecognized theme version:'} $version;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- when `$version` is zero, this function calls `m2-inspection.get-theme-color($theme, $args...)`\r\n- `m2-inspection.get-theme-color` function internally calls `theming.get-color-from-palette($palette, $args...)`\r\n- `theming.get-color-from-palette` function accepts 3 arguments `$palette`, `$hue`, `$opacity`\r\n\r\n\r\nso when I want to make custom theme for a component like below, it fails\r\n```scss\r\n@use \"@angular/material\" as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  // this will result in an error, because get-theme-color accepts not more than 3 arguments\r\n  $foreground-palette-divider-color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, foreground, divider, 0.3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nError reproduction is explained in Description.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nchecking the argument length should be dynamic in `get-theme-color` method, \r\n\r\n- for Angular Material Design 2, maximum 4 arguments should be allowed\r\n- for Angular Material Design 3, maximum 3 arguments should be allowed\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nwhen I call `get-theme-color` method\r\n\r\n- for both Angular Material Design 2, Angular Material Design 3 maximum 3 arguments is allowed\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^17.2.1\r\n- CDK/Material: ^17.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29612","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(core/theming/_inspsction): can't pass opacity parameter to get-theme-color() method as it doesn't accept more than 3 arguments\" (#29612)"},{"Id":"2475071210","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-20T08:47:26","Actor":"Choppi","Number":"29611","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DatePicker): Range DatePicker Input updates take some delay","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I try to manually update input value from ts files for a DateRangePicker component, like adding slashes when users types a day or a month (or more complex cases), it does not update the mirrorring value of the span.\r\n\r\nIt works well with a simple DatePicker (probably because it does not have any mirrorring value)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/daterange-picker-refresh?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

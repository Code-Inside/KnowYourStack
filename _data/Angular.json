imagine it was done in order to make the code more flexible :thinking: \r\n\r\nAnyways as far I can tell all errors are just strings in the animations code and there are also parts in which getting something different from a string would likely create undesirable results, mainly when combining them together for the generation of an error message, for example like so:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a92a89b0eb127a59d7e071502b5850e57618ec2d/packages/animations/browser/src/render/timeline_animation_engine.ts#L37\r\n\r\nhere if errors could be more complex data structures such as objects, when converted to strings by `join` (unless they implement their own `toString`) would just produce `\"[object Object]\"` which of course would produce a pretty bad error message\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think this is part of any public api so it should be a safe change to make :slightly_smiling_face:

regarding animation-related attributes on special elements","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\r\n\r\nanimations, compiler, core\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\nThis issue is for taking into consideration improving the error messages for the case when animation-related attributes (as far as I can tell those only include triggers and `@.disabled`) are used on special elements (`<ng-template>`, `<ng-content>` or `<ng-container>`).\r\n\r\nThis probably needs to be added in the template type-checking subsystem as well as to the runtime (under ngDevMode, so it's tree-shaken away in prod bundles).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Explanation:\r\n\r\nFor example see here:\r\n![145676817-e91f2aff-14a5-4c5f-86b6-4a59511f0a21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61631103/150013632-7e2e1e4a-3eec-4207-bc65-d133cf6998b1.png)\r\n\r\nWe only get runtime errors in the console saying that the animation attributes are not know properties of `ng-template`/`ng-container` the suggestion here is provide more useful error messages prompting the user not to use animation-related attributes for special elements since the attributes will not take effect for such elements\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nWe get the aforementioned runtime errors in the console but the application runs without issues (naturally no animation is applied to the special-elements), the application also gets built without issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Proposed Behavior\r\n\r\nProvide new warnings for this issues during the compilation of the application (both during development and builds) and also improve the existing runtime errors to provide more useful information to the users.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively we could make the compilation fail as it encounters such cases, but that may be a bit too much I'd imagine)\r\n\r\nPossibly we could also only just update the errors to be more specific as that is also consistent with the animations errors, for example when an animation trigger hasn't been registered, nothing breaks but simple a console error is presented to the user:\r\n![Screenshot at 2022-01-18 20-54-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61631103/150017129-72b9ddd0-778c-458b-bdad-6495d3ab1ab6.png)\r\nensuring the same sort of behavior here could be good for consistency and it would also not cause any breaking of current functionalities (note: the console error appears both locally and in production builds).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Extra\r\n\r\nThe issue relates to the special elements but I am wondering if other elements could/should be included as well, for example I am thinking of `router-outlet` it isn't technically wrong to put a trigger on it, but since it is only a placeholder I am wondering if we should at least warn the user about it (for example if they may think that animating the `router-outlet` can have an effect on the routed components)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nOriginal conversation:

`mouseleave()` leads to the following behaviour, which is technically correct, but not logically:\r\n\r\nExample (see gif): \r\n\r\n1. I show a fontawesome icon that changes on `mouseenter()` and `mouseleave()`\r\n2. Clicking a button hides the icons and makes new elements appear.\r\n3. Going back and making the old elements appear, the mouse technically never \"left\" the icons, so the fontawesome icon for the hovering state is still displayed.\r\n4. \r\n![hover issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11761828/149915996-75e48a13-f8fe-4f9d-9a3d-cbb2da53863d.gif)\r\n\r\nI know, technically `onmouseleave()` represents just that, a mouse leaving an element, but logically it did so, when the element disappears. The only workaround seems to be to make the `(click)` reset a hover-state representing var.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 12.1.4\r\nNode: 14.18.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1201.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    12.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             12.1.4\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.3.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44740","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"mouseleave() not firing on disappearing objects\" (#44740)"},{"Id":"1106138229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-17T18:06:56","Actor":"yousafnawaz","Number":"44738","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update deprecated form of the tap operator in http example","State":"open","Body":"update deprecated form of the tap operator.

A getter/function returning an array of numbers, not objects, works correctly.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nget numbers() {\r\nreturn [1, 2, 3];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if the array contains both numbers and objects, the issue is not reproducible for numbers and is reproducible for objects:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nget numbers() {\r\nreturn [{label:'button1'}, 2, 3];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If an array is set as a constant:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nbuttonsArray = [\r\n{ label: \"Button1\" },\r\n{ label: \"Button2\" },\r\n{ label: \"Button3\" }\r\n];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe understand that the problem is related to our library, but it is not clear how to start the research because the following points are unclear:\r\n\r\n1. the difference between the code generation when a getter and a constant array are used in *ngFor;\r\n2. how this can be related to the event subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be very helpful if you clarify these (or add some more) details. This will allow us to investigate and resolve the issue on our end.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAn example is included in the code-sandbox\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/kind-varahamihira-b50dt?file=/src/app/app.component.html\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.12\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.12\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.12\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.12\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.12\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.12\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.12\r\nrxjs                              6.6.2\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n Anything else:\r\n\r\nThe issue is also reproducible in the latest version @angular/cli: 13.1.3.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The click event does not work for list items when *ngFor is used in a certain scenario\" (#44720)"},{"Id":"1103767414","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-14T15:09:20","Actor":"wencakisa","Number":"44719","RawContent":null,"Title":"`UrlSegmentGroup` constructor error - `Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi 👋🏼 \r\n\r\nAs I was updating Angular from `v11` to `v12` with the help of [update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=11.0-12.0) - I noticed that the navigation suddenly stopped working. Based on the stack trace, I've come to this conclusion:\r\n\r\n[The part in the `UrlSegmentGroup` constructor where the `parent` files are generated (recursively)](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/6a55affacd9b027b43f898f76e666dcfdbac7863/packages/router/src/url_tree.ts#L238) is now unable to do this because the `parent` property is read-only.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nforEach(children, (v: any, k: any) => v.parent = this);\r\n// ____________________________________^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is executed because I have the following line in my code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { DefaultUrlSerializer } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nconst url = new DefaultUrlSerializer().parse(redirectUrl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [`DefaultUrlSerializer.parse`](https://angular.io/api/router/DefaultUrlSerializer#parse) method parses the passed string to a `UrlTree`.\r\n\r\nFinally, once I pass the previously generated `UrlTree` to [`router.navigateByUrl`](https://angular.io/api/router/Router#navigatebyurl) - this exception gets raised.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen I downgrade to `v11` - everything is correct. ✅ \r\n\r\n> Note: There's a huge chance I'm missing something in the process, but from what I've concluded looking at the stack trace - it seems like an Angular regression.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 🙌🏼 \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]'\r\nTypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]'\r\n    at router.js:755:37\r\n    at forEach (router.js:572:13)\r\n    at new UrlSegmentGroup (router.js:755:9)\r\n    at split (router.js:2493:15)\r\n    at ApplyRedirects.apply (router.js:2619:28)\r\n    at applyRedirects (router.js:2607:93)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.project (router.js:2952:27)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber._next (switchMap.js:28:27)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.next (Subscriber.js:49:18)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.notifyNext (switchMap.js:66:26)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1213:31)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1167:17)\r\n    at zone.js:1279:17\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:406:31)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:28679:33)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:405:60)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone.js:178:47)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone.js:582:35)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invokeTask [as invoke] (zone.js:491:21)\r\n    at invokeTask (zone.js:1600:14)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 12.2.14\r\nNode: 16.13.2 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1202.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core               12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         12.2.14\r\n@angular/cdk                       12.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                       12.2.14\r\n@angular/material                  12.2.13\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular                12.2.14\r\nrxjs                               6.6.3\r\ntypescript                         4.3.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44719","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`UrlSegmentGroup` constructor error -

Now we cannot, or the option changed and it is nowhere told how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nScenario is very simple. Application has 15+ languages and I need to serve a specific language, in my example: German. I can't anymore because it says that this is not a valid option.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate an application with two locales and try to launch the one which is not set as default. It seems it's not possible anymore.\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible using this command: `ng serve --configuration=de`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"i18nFile\": \"src/i18n/messages.de.xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nLocale\": \"de\" <-- ERROR since v13\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"browserTarget\": \"frontend:build:de\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre>Data path \"\" must NOT have additional properties(i18nFile)<code>\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBuild fails and application is not served. Since I see squiggly lines over all three options it is clear that all of them are not valid anymore.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1301.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

On large Angular projects, like ours, Angular + webpack is very slow (1-2 minutes to start `ng serve` for example, separate issue we really need to address somehow). \r\n\r\nWhat seems to occur is that chrome (or ChromeHeadless) gives up trying to load the page (it would see the problem that the server is not responding). Karma then kills the browser and restarts it (triggering issue https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/3745). Eventually the webpack dev server starts responding, and the tests run. Once the tests complete, the coverage report (and potentially other reporters) fail to write their reports.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a bug in Karma that needs to be fixed, it does not seem to make sense to start the test framework until the webpack dev server is ready to serve the application. When it is ready, we see the `Browser application bundle generation complete` printed to the terminal.\r\n\r\nIdeally karma would be started after a 200 HTTP response could be obtained from the webpack dev server\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly thing that is required is to run `ng test` on an Angular project. The problem to reproduce is that the application has to have enough code to cause webpack dev server to be too slow to start before chrome gives up loading the page.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.2\r\nNode: 14.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.13\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                13.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\nwebpack                         5.65.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

For example:\r\n```ts\r\n// Infers string - fails\r\nformBuilder.group<{a: FormGroup<{a: FormControl<'a' | 'b'>}>}>({a: formBuilder.group({a: formBuilder.control('a')})});\r\n// Fails to infer array type\r\nformBuilder.group<{a: FormArray<FormControl<boolean>>}>({a: formBuilder.array([])});\r\n// Incorrect auto complete here (in ...) - k has unknown type\r\nformBuilder.group<{g: FormGroup<{k: FormGroup<{a: FormControl<number>}>}>}>({g: formBuilder.group({...})});\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new form builder variation which is oriented to cases when you provide the form type yourself. The new form builder will use `NoInfer` for parameter so the inference will be strictly from the return type which will solve the problems above.\r\nAn example implementation that will solve all the issues above:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class NoInferFormBuilder {\r\n  control<T>(\r\n    formState: NoInfer<T | FormControlState<T>>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormControl<T>(formState, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  group<\r\n    T extends {\r\n      [K in keyof T]: AbstractControl<any>;\r\n    }\r\n  >(\r\n    controls: NoInfer<T>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormGroup<T>(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  array<T extends AbstractControl<any>>(\r\n    controls: NoInfer<T[]>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormArray<T>(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nGet around those problems which can be annoying and repetitive or use form classes which helps to some extent or use untyped forms.

Importantly, using a recent version of `istanbul-lib-instrument` and not the one that `karma-coverage` depends on.\r\n- [x] Preserve source maps so that coverage is mapped back to source files.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\n* The additions in `packages/angular/build/src/tools/babel/plugins/*` are 1:1 copies of files already present in `packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/babel/plugins/*`. I couldn't find a clean way to prevent that. Either @angular/build have to expose the plugin in `package.json#exports` or it would have to depend on @angular-devkit/build-angular. Both seemed undesirable.\r\n* The logic for excluding files from coverage is lifted from the [equivalent webpack config](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ecfb2b261356946d5f4a653f90c0b78db4ef519c/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/common.ts#L424-L429). Given the state of Karma, I didn't make an effort to refactor the code to share the logic - I assume we don't expect many changes here. That would definitely be possible with limited effort though.\r\n\r\n### Historical Notes\r\n\r\nApproaches that _didn't_ work:\r\n\r\n- Instrument entire output chunks. `karma-coverage` really doesn't want to filter data from coverage data after the fact. Not to mention that it could be fairly expensive to send that data back to the karma process if it's then just discarded.\r\n- Implied above: Use `karma-coverage`'s built-in preprocessor. The outdated instrumentation code it's using doesn't handle async function correctly and gives bad function coverage data because of it.\r\n\r\nThings that _could've_ worked:\r\n\r\n- Apply source maps while instrumenting instead of while post-processing the coverage data. But that would've been swimming against the stream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28509","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): karma-coverage w/ app builder\" (#28509)"},{"Id":"2552497527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T18:49:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28514","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28496","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28514","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies\" (#28514)"},{"Id":"2553216682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T15:30:47","Actor":"RGunning","Number":"28517","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: allow configuration of the vite HMR server","State":"open","Body":"Vite allows additional configuration options for the HMR server that let the user set the port, protocol and host etc. of the HMR server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguring HMR server to run on a different port to the main application fixes the issue\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, when using the `reset()` method with reactive forms, the form controls are unexpectedly marked as `touched` or `dirty`, causing **validation errors** to display immediately.

Observe that form controls are marked as `touched` or `dirty` even though the stepper was reset, and validation errors are displayed.\r\n5. Alternatively, you can also use the native `mat-stepper`: https://material.angular.io/components/stepper/examples#stepper-errors\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter calling `stepper.reset()`, all form controls should be reset to their initial state, marked as pristine and untouched. No validation errors should be displayed until the user interacts with the form controls again.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCalling `stepper.reset()` resets the stepper and form groups but marks all form controls as `touched` or `dirty`, triggering validation errors to display immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `18.1.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `18.1.1`\r\n- Browser(s): `Google Chrome`_(Version 127.0.6533.73 (Official Build) (arm64))_\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS(Sonoma 14.7)`, _Apple M1_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Stepper): Stepper `reset()` Method Marks Form Controls as `Touched/Dirty`, Triggering Validation Errors\" (#29781)"},{"Id":"2540752632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T06:28:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `youtube-player` to use the `inject` function instead of constructor-based injection.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function\" (#29775)"},{"Id":"2543202768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:06:03","Actor":"jacob-noble","Number":"29777","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/scrolling): virtual scroll flickers in zoneless mode.","State":"open","Body":"When `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is enabled, virtual-scroll-viewport flickers during scroll because the transform operation becomes visible.

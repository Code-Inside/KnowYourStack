External runtime files are stylesheets that are not embedded within the component code at build time. Instead a URL path is emitted within a component's metadata. When combined with separate updates to the shared style host and DOM renderer, this will allow these stylesheet files to be fetched and processed by a development server on-demand. This behavior is controlled by an internal compiler option `externalRuntimeStyles`. The Angular CLI development server will also be updated to provide the serving functionality once this capability is enabled. This capability enables upcoming features such as automatic component style hot module replacement (HMR) and development server deferred stylesheet processing. The current implementation does not affect the behavior of inline styles. Only the behavior of stylesheet files referenced via component properties `styleUrl`/`styleUrls` and relative template `link` elements are changed by enabling the internal option.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a work in progress and may not reflect the final design.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57613","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): support external runtime component styles for file-based stylesheets\" (#57613)"},{"Id":"2498018524","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-30T19:13:51","Actor":"bencodezen","Number":"57612","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update template in-depth guide","State":"open","Body":"Already reviewed for `target:minor.` This PR is for merging into `target:patch`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57612","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update template in-depth guide\" (#57612)"},{"Id":"2497518199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-30T15:23:28","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57611","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): Do extract symbols from private modules.","State":"open","Body":"Follow-up for #57346\r\n\r\nModules like `core/primitives` are considered private and their symbols shouldn't be exposed nor linked in the docs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): Do extract symbols from private modules.\" (#57611)"},{"Id":"2497501690","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-30T15:15:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"57610","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(platform-browser): support adding component styles as external link elements","State":"open","Body":"The shared style host now has the capability to add component styles as link elements with external style references. This is currently unused within the runtime but is an enabling feature for upcoming features such as automatic component style HMR and development server deferred stylesheet processing. Instead of inline style content that is then added to a `style` element for each host node, a `link` element with a stylesheet `rel` attribute and a `href` attribute can now be created. The development server must be configured to provide the relevant component stylesheet upon request. The Angular CLI development server will provide this functionality once this capability is enabled.\r\nSince the primary use of this capability is development mode and will not be used for production code, server (SSR) style reuse is currently not yet implemented but may be implemented in the future.\r\nAdditionally, the current implementation intentionally does not alter the existing `style` element based code paths to avoid potential breakage.

This capability leverages the upcoming support within the AOT -compiler to emit components that generate `link` elements instead of embedding the stylesheet contents for file-based styles (e.g., `styleUrl`). In combination with support within the development server to handle requests for component stylesheets, file-based component stylesheets will be able to be replaced without a full page reload.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages the AOT compiler option `externalRuntimeStyles` which uses the result of the resource handler's resolution and emits new external stylesheet metadata within the component output code. This new metadata works in concert with the Angular runtime to generate `link` elements which can then leverage existing global stylesheet HMR capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis capability is current disabled by default while all elements are integrated across the CLI and framework and can be controlled via the `NG_HMR_CSTYLES=1` environment variable. Once fully integrated the environment variable will unneeded.\r\n\r\nThis feature is only intended for use with the development server. Component styles within in built code including production are not affected by this feature.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Rebuild times have not yet been optimized.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v19.0.0-next.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1900-next2-2024-08-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/19.0.0-next.1...19.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   Render default fallback with empty `projectableNodes`.\n\n    When passing an empty array to `projectableNodes` in the `createComponent` API, the default fallback content of the `ng-content` will be rendered if present. To prevent rendering the default content, pass `document.createTextNode('')` as a `projectableNode`.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    // The first ng-content will render the default fallback content if present\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[], [secondNode]] });\n\n    // To prevent projecting the default fallback content:\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[document.createTextNode('')], [secondNode]] });\n\n    ```\n-   The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid\n    mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization\n    when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone\n    above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests\n    which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync`\n    and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\n##### elements\n\n-   as part of switching away from custom CD behavior to the\n    hybrid scheduler, timing of change detection around custom elements has\n    changed subtly. These changes make elements more efficient, but can cause\n    tests which encoded assumptions about how or when elements would be checked\n    to require updating.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [50f08e6c4bf](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/50f08e6c4bf1caeeb08d3505ce7fabd466b9c76b) | feat | automatically use sizes auto in NgOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;57479](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57479)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4716c3b9660](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4716c3b9660b01f4ef3642fb774270b7f4a13d1a) | perf | reduce duplicate component style resolution ([#&#8203;57502](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57502)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a3cdbfe87f5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a3cdbfe87f5a8daef11a154ef3edb5a3a5c12f77) | fix | avoid leaking memory if component throws during creation ([#&#8203;57546](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57546)) |\n| [7a99815146e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7a99815146eb78074aa3ed6db73c6e87042df692) | fix | Do not bubble capture events.

This value was added in TypeScript 5.4 and is intended to model the behavior of modern bundlers such as used in the default `application` builder. This option value also has the advantage of automatically enabling `esModuleInterop` and setting `moduleResolution` to `bundler` which are the currently generated values for new projects. This allows explicit use of these options to be removed from the generated file.

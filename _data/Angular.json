Production builds and releases are not affected. If you discover any additional HMR challenges which don't appear to be related to the linked issues above, verify that you are on a recent version (19.1.x), and please [file a new issue](http://github.com/angular/angular/issues/) and link it here so we can triage and investigate.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn the meantime, if you encounter any problems relating to HMR, you can work around them in three ways:\n\n1. Refresh the page \\- This loads a fresh copy of your application with up to date code.  \n2. `ng serve \\--no-hmr` \\- This disables HMR for your local devserver and automatically refreshes the page on any code changes.  \n3. Disable HMR for your project \\- Configuring `angular.json` will disable HMR for all `ng serve` invocations by default.  \n   * This is useful for a project with a large number of developers without needing to communicate these workarounds to all contributors.  \n   * Remember to re-enable once the relevant issues are fixed\\!\n\n```json\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"my-project\": {\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"serve\": {\n          \"options\": {\n            \"hmr\": false\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThank you for sharing any HMR issues and helping improve Angular one bugfix at a time.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nSCSS files are scattered across a few directories. There is some duplication as well.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n1. Move all styles in a single folder as close as possible to `ng-devtools` component – as stated in the section above there had been SCSS files that resided in the app wrappers (the shell and demo apps) or the main `devtools/` directory. There were also duplicated browser-specific SCSS files in each app wrapper. This change should, hopefully, make style management a bit easier. Each app wrapper still retains a `styles.scss` which should ultimately be used only for applying styles that are specific to that app wrapper, not the devtools.\r\n\r\n2. Set a browser class to the document body – this is an improvement of #46037. Basically, additionally to loading browser-specific global styles, we also set a browser-specific class to the body. We can use that for any granular or component-based styles.\r\n\r\n3. SCSS mixins – right now the theme styles are applied via `:host-context(<THEME-CLASS>)`. What the mixins do is to encapsulate that logic in case it changes (or the class names change). The mixins also provide a parameter for targeting a specific browser. Eventually, some of these mixins might render useless, so we can drop them.\r\n\r\n**Next changes**\r\n\r\n- Converting to the theme mixins\r\n- Extracting some of the colors and creating actual themes based on them\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59589","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): styles management\" (#59589)"},{"Id":"2794608383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T09:45:40","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"59584","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(platform-server): fix flaky incremental hydration test","State":"closed","Body":"This commit updates a test setup to define a global `ngServerMode` correctly for a test that was emulating client-only behavior.

However, this is the rendered body of `<app-root>`, using either file-based or inline template:\n\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1 </app-root>\n```\n\nOther variants\n\nRemoving `<app-b />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nRemoving `<app-c />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nTrends:\n\n- When removing A or B, C's host element stays but is empty.

I have unit tests for this, which pass.  When I upgrade to Angualr 19, my tests no longer passed.  It seemed to be an issue with how `tick` works, which I see mentioned in [the release notes here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#core-8)\n\n> The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync` and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\nHere is my service:\n```ts\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\nexport class TimerService {\n  private isRunningSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(false);\n  private totalDurationMin = 0;\n  private totalDurationMinutesSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.totalDurationMin);\n  private timerSubscription = new Subscription();\n\n  public totalDurationMinutes$ = this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.asObservable();\n  public isRunning$ = this.isRunningSubject$.asObservable();\n\n  public start(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(true);\n    this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n\n    this.timerSubscription = interval(60 * 1000).subscribe({\n      next: () => {\n        this.totalDurationMin++;\n        this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  public stop(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(false);\n    this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is my unit test which passes in Angular 18, but fails in 19\n\n```ts\nit('should update the observables and start the timer', fakeAsync(() => {\n  //skip initial emit, the start of the timer, and then then next 4 minute ticks\n  service.totalDurationMinutes$.pipe(skip(6)).subscribe({\n    next: (val) => {\n      console.log(`minutes: ${val}`);\n      expect(val).toEqual(5);\n    },\n  });\n\n  service.start();\n  tick(60 * 1000 * 5); //simulate 5 minutes passing\n\n  discardPeriodicTasks();\n}));\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n - [Angular 18](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rbkdn2wp?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n - [Angular 19](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rvqhvurf?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n\nThe unit test fails with `Expected 6 to equal 5.`\n\nYou'll notice that in v18, the console output contains\n```\nminutes: 5\n```\nand in v19 it contains\n```\nminutes: 5\nminutes: 6\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`tick` fires too many times in v19 compared to v18 in unit tests\" (#59577)"},{"Id":"2793884294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T22:07:54","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"59576","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature(compiler): Add Skip Hydration diagnostic.","State":"open","Body":"The diagnostic was created in #49512 but was never added to the list of diagnostic that run.\r\n\r\nfixes #59569\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this PR enables a diagnostic, we'll need a TGP.

Suggested behavior:\n\n1. `baseHref` **takes precedence if defined**.

I wasn't able to find any documentation that indicated `UrlMatcher` and SSR are not working together. Was this a issue that needed to be solved? The only issue i was able to find on the web was in combination with the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) library (https://dev.to/michaeljota/how-to-add-module-federation-into-your-angular-micro-frontend-apps-jmh)\n\nBefore we start refactoring our project (which requires SSR and also `UrlMatcher`) or downgrading to 19.0 I would like to know what the implications were for this \"fix\".

The best practices and what actually works is unclear right now.\n\nWhen you scaffold a project with --ssr, you get a `server.ts` that even says you can put APIs in there.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work with `ng serve` because `server.ts` isn't used with `ng serve` (it calls your server module directly). To get around this I created a separate api.ts that could be run independently, or from within server.ts. I also created an environments file to switch between the endpoints based on dev mode or production mode.\n\nThis feels hacky but works OK, but then I realized that `ng build` is attempting a prerender WITHOUT my APIs, so it's failing.\n\nWhat's the intended way to use Angular, SSR, and locally hosted APIs?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`ng new test --ssr` (opt out of server routing and app engine apis)\n\nsee server.ts 'Example Express Rest API endpoints can be defined here.' - try doing this.\n\n`ng serve`\nAPIs are missing\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 22.10.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SSR + Local API is a confusing experience\" (#29377)"},{"Id":"2794237931","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T07:27:54","Actor":"princemaple","Number":"29378","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: HMR respect baseHref","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nHMR via `/@ng/...` doesn't use the `baseHref`\n\nI sometimes start multiple ng serve and use a reverse proxy to serve the apps during dev.

I have been using a Windows 11 for past few months & whenever I find free time to contribute I struggle to run on Windows 10 & 11 all the time.\n\nI have been provided a new laptop & I'm facing issues such as:\n\n1. error Couldn't find match for <package hash> in \"refs/heads/main\" for \"https://github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds.git\".\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install for documentation about this command. \n\nSometimes gets fixed on yarn cache clear, mostly happens whenever I update the work and run yarn after a long time.\n\n2. iBazel [1:54PM]: Error writing failure to stdin: write |1: file already closed\n\nhappens all the time, gets fixed sometimes when I delete bazel folders and end all processes from task manager.\n\n3. iBazel [1:08PM]: Error starting process: fork/exec C:\\Users\\CENTRI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\bazel_script_path4055922069.bat: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\niBazel [1:08PM]: Run start failed fork/exec C:\\Users\\CENTRI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\bazel_script_path4055922069.bat: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\n\nI checked the bat file and its 0kb so I'm not sure whats causing it to generate an empty file. I also have added BAZEL_SH to the environment variables. I also came across other issues where peopled claimed its caused by WSL on Windows but I have had it disabled it on both work laptops. I also have used bash and Windows command to run the project but errors are always the same.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/1e5663636eb38d5556f500840dd7e00dd9950b70/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md?plain=1","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30341","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"setting up repository locally always create issues on Windows.\" (#30341)"},{"Id":"2791906861","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T07:27:18","Actor":"jolenius","Number":"30340","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): chip with autocomplete adds two chips when selecting filtered option using keyboard","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen combining chips with the autocomplete component you get two entries of chips when filtering the list of options by typing a few characters and then selecting an option by using your keyboard (arrow down and enter).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/2qghuqyq?file=src%2Fexample%2Fchips-autocomplete-example.ts\n(stackblitz fetched from the Chips Autocomplete example at https://material.angular.io/components/chips/examples)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

The column rendering array has two properties: fieldName (which is the actual field from the backend API response) and displayName (the name that shows up in the UI). Here's a quick example:\n\n`<th mat-header-cell cdkDrag *matHeaderCellDef>{{column.displayName}}</th><td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\">{{element[column.fieldName]}}</td>`\n\nSo, when I'm setting up the row, I've got this simple string array that just has the field names from the array above. This way, the actual data can connect with the table columns. Here's a quick example:\n\n`<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedColumnsFields\"></tr><tr mat-row *matRowDef=\"let element; columns:displayedColumnsField;\"></tr>`\n\nSo after this code change, the material column reordering isn't working anymore.

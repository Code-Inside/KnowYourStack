A getter/function returning an array of numbers, not objects, works correctly.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nget numbers() {\r\nreturn [1, 2, 3];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if the array contains both numbers and objects, the issue is not reproducible for numbers and is reproducible for objects:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nget numbers() {\r\nreturn [{label:'button1'}, 2, 3];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If an array is set as a constant:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nbuttonsArray = [\r\n{ label: \"Button1\" },\r\n{ label: \"Button2\" },\r\n{ label: \"Button3\" }\r\n];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe understand that the problem is related to our library, but it is not clear how to start the research because the following points are unclear:\r\n\r\n1. the difference between the code generation when a getter and a constant array are used in *ngFor;\r\n2. how this can be related to the event subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be very helpful if you clarify these (or add some more) details. This will allow us to investigate and resolve the issue on our end.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAn example is included in the code-sandbox\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/kind-varahamihira-b50dt?file=/src/app/app.component.html\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.12\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.12\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.12\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.12\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.12\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.12\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.12\r\nrxjs                              6.6.2\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n Anything else:\r\n\r\nThe issue is also reproducible in the latest version @angular/cli: 13.1.3.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The click event does not work for list items when *ngFor is used in a certain scenario\" (#44720)"},{"Id":"1103767414","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-14T15:09:20","Actor":"wencakisa","Number":"44719","RawContent":null,"Title":"`UrlSegmentGroup` constructor error - `Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi 👋🏼 \r\n\r\nAs I was updating Angular from `v11` to `v12` with the help of [update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=11.0-12.0) - I noticed that the navigation suddenly stopped working. Based on the stack trace, I've come to this conclusion:\r\n\r\n[The part in the `UrlSegmentGroup` constructor where the `parent` files are generated (recursively)](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/6a55affacd9b027b43f898f76e666dcfdbac7863/packages/router/src/url_tree.ts#L238) is now unable to do this because the `parent` property is read-only.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nforEach(children, (v: any, k: any) => v.parent = this);\r\n// ____________________________________^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is executed because I have the following line in my code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { DefaultUrlSerializer } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nconst url = new DefaultUrlSerializer().parse(redirectUrl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [`DefaultUrlSerializer.parse`](https://angular.io/api/router/DefaultUrlSerializer#parse) method parses the passed string to a `UrlTree`.\r\n\r\nFinally, once I pass the previously generated `UrlTree` to [`router.navigateByUrl`](https://angular.io/api/router/Router#navigatebyurl) - this exception gets raised.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen I downgrade to `v11` - everything is correct. ✅ \r\n\r\n> Note: There's a huge chance I'm missing something in the process, but from what I've concluded looking at the stack trace - it seems like an Angular regression.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 🙌🏼 \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]'\r\nTypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'parent' of object '[object Object]'\r\n    at router.js:755:37\r\n    at forEach (router.js:572:13)\r\n    at new UrlSegmentGroup (router.js:755:9)\r\n    at split (router.js:2493:15)\r\n    at ApplyRedirects.apply (router.js:2619:28)\r\n    at applyRedirects (router.js:2607:93)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.project (router.js:2952:27)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber._next (switchMap.js:28:27)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.next (Subscriber.js:49:18)\r\n    at SwitchMapSubscriber.notifyNext (switchMap.js:66:26)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1213:31)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1167:17)\r\n    at zone.js:1279:17\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:406:31)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:28679:33)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:405:60)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone.js:178:47)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone.js:582:35)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invokeTask [as invoke] (zone.js:491:21)\r\n    at invokeTask (zone.js:1600:14)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 12.2.14\r\nNode: 16.13.2 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1202.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core               12.2.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         12.2.14\r\n@angular/cdk                       12.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                       12.2.14\r\n@angular/material                  12.2.13\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular                12.2.14\r\nrxjs                               6.6.3\r\ntypescript                         4.3.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44719","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`UrlSegmentGroup` constructor error -

It swaps out `_extendedTemplateDiagnostics` for `strictTemplates`, since strict templates are required anyways. The commit message includes a deeper discussion of the feature just to give users something useful in release notes.\r\n\r\nExtended template diagnostics provide additional analysis about Angular templates by emitting warnings for specific patterns known to be error prone or cause developer confusion. Currently, there are two such diagnostics which are enabled by default:\r\n\r\n* `invalidBananaInBox` emits a warning if a user writes a two-way binding backwards like `([foo])=\"bar\"`, when they actually wanted `[(foo)]=\"bar\"`.\r\n* `nullishCoalescingNotNullable` emits a warning if a binding attempts to perform nullish coalescing (`??`) on a type which does not include `null` or `undefined`, such as `{{ foo ?? 'bar' }}` where `foo` is defined as `string` instead of `string | null`.\r\n\r\nThese diagnostics are enabled as warnings by default, but this can be configured in the `tsconfig.json` like so:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"extendedDiagnostics\": {\r\n      // The categories to use for specific diagnostics.\r\n      \"checks\": {\r\n        // Maps check name to its category.\r\n        \"invalidBananaInBox\": \"suppress\"\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      // The category to use for any diagnostics not listed in `checks` above.\r\n      \"defaultCategory\": \"error\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowed categories for a diagnostic are `warning` (default), `error`, or `suppress`. `warning` emits the diagnostic but allows the compilation to succeed, `error` *will* fail the compilation, while `suppress` will ignore the diagnostic altogether.\r\n\r\nThe initial release has two diagnostics, and we are hoping to expand this longer term to add more diagnostics and provide additional insight into Angular templates to detect and surface developer mistakes *before* hours of debugging are wasted.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\nDocs are included in #44704.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nExtended diagnostics are gated on a private `_extendedTemplateDiagnostics` flag in `tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #42966.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nExtended diagnostics are now enabled by default. This includes two existing diagnostics: `invalidBananaInBox` and `nullishCoalescingNotNullable`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\nThis will enable two new extended diagnostics as warnings. Existing users may see new warnings as a result, but no builds should fail as a result, so this is not considered a breaking change. Users may disable specific (or all) diagnostics via the above `tsconfig.json` configuration.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @danieltre23 for designing and implementing extended diagnostics.

Now we cannot, or the option changed and it is nowhere told how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nScenario is very simple. Application has 15+ languages and I need to serve a specific language, in my example: German. I can't anymore because it says that this is not a valid option.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate an application with two locales and try to launch the one which is not set as default. It seems it's not possible anymore.\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible using this command: `ng serve --configuration=de`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"i18nFile\": \"src/i18n/messages.de.xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nLocale\": \"de\" <-- ERROR since v13\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"browserTarget\": \"frontend:build:de\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre>Data path \"\" must NOT have additional properties(i18nFile)<code>\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBuild fails and application is not served.

On large Angular projects, like ours, Angular + webpack is very slow (1-2 minutes to start `ng serve` for example, separate issue we really need to address somehow). \r\n\r\nWhat seems to occur is that chrome (or ChromeHeadless) gives up trying to load the page (it would see the problem that the server is not responding). Karma then kills the browser and restarts it (triggering issue https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/3745). Eventually the webpack dev server starts responding, and the tests run. Once the tests complete, the coverage report (and potentially other reporters) fail to write their reports.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a bug in Karma that needs to be fixed, it does not seem to make sense to start the test framework until the webpack dev server is ready to serve the application. When it is ready, we see the `Browser application bundle generation complete` printed to the terminal.\r\n\r\nIdeally karma would be started after a 200 HTTP response could be obtained from the webpack dev server\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly thing that is required is to run `ng test` on an Angular project. The problem to reproduce is that the application has to have enough code to cause webpack dev server to be too slow to start before chrome gives up loading the page.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.2\r\nNode: 14.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.13\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                13.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\nwebpack                         5.65.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

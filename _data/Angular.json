It doesn't failed with error, however further usage of such element becomes unpredictable. \r\nFor example, the following code tries to create an svg and set position style:\r\n```ts\r\nconst svg = this._renderer.createElement('svg', 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg');\r\nthis._renderer.appendChild(hostElement, svg);\r\nthis._renderer.setStyle(svg, 'position', 'fixed');\r\n```\r\nThe error occurs in the last line, since svg element has been created incorrectly. \r\n\r\nAfter quick investigation, I found that the following line has been changed: \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/13.2.0/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/dom_renderer.ts#L148\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62712576/151632642-a9c8f174-f870-4ead-b13b-30de0875ec2b.png)\r\nThis change was introduced in v13.2.0, it works fine in v13.1.3\r\n\r\nAs I understood,  `NAMESPACE_URIS` contains namespace shortcuts, but what about specifying \"full\" namespace or any other namespace that is not in `NAMESPACE_URIS`? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

However the JS community has generally standardized on `===` and `!==` as the go to comparison operators, with many tools banning `==` and `!=` outright from codebases.

Often they are used together in this way:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<span>{{ birthday | date: 'YYYY-MM-dd' ??

However in practice, the `??` has higher precedence than the `|`, so it actually does `'YYYY-MM-dd' ?? 'Unknown'`, which is useless.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- How the developer wanted it to work. -->\r\n<span>{{ (birthday | date: 'YYYY-MM-dd') ??

'Unknown'` and [correctly identifies this mistake](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/43419). Unfortunately the error message is a bit unclear. We should either adjust the diagnostic or add a new one to specifically call out this pipe use case and suggest adding parentheses in the right manner.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could just leave the existing diagnostic as is and accept a less-accurate error message. It does correctly identify the mistake, just with a less-than-ideal error message.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better error message for nullish coalescing a pipe argument\" (#44871)"},{"Id":"1116935779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T02:29:53","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"44870","RawContent":null,"Title":"Warn on non-nullable optional chain","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nOptional chaining is a great way to safely access properties that might be `null` or `undefined`, for example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {Component, Input} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n    <span>Hello, {{ user?.name ??

This leads to confusion and tricks readers of the code into thinking that there is a case where \"Hello, guest!\" is displayed, when that actually isn't the case. If the default \"guest\" string comes from somewhere else, it could lead to dead code and possibly result in excess bundle size.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should consider an extended diagnostic to identify and warn developers in this situation.

This can contain a description, and there are other `i18n-` attributes which provide localized versions of user-visible text (such as `i18n-title`). The attributes are easy to forget, especially edge cases like `i18n-title`.

These links maybe be from page to page within a single website or they may direct the user to an external website or resource. Links are the reason the web is called the web, interconnected websites referring to each other.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Angular Router only handles navigation between internal links within it's own configured route object. But as is the nature of the web, sometimes it is required to navigate away from the current domain to another. The proposed solution for this is to create a community component to handle internal and external links, but this then takes away some fundamental accessibility features of anchor links, or makes it overly cumbersome to retroactively support all those features.\r\n\r\nWhen developing an angular site and compiling templates with hard coded links this is not a problem as you can pick and choose where to use standard anchors and other enhanced with the `routerLink` directive. But when you start digging into the realm of templated being populated with dynamic data either from API's or provided by Content Management Systems it is not possible to tell if the link injected into the component is internal or external.\r\n\r\n@atscott provided a [rudimentary example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-anylink?file=src/app/any-link.ts), but as mentioned above there is no passing of the (currently) 8 dedicated anchor attributes (bar the href), nor the multitude of global attributes that can also be assigned to an anchor element. This method of creating a new component adds extra DOM bloat (why reinvent HTML elements that already exist), removes key features including accessibility features, and creates a disconnect between the host element `<any-link>` and the true anchor element within.\r\n\r\nOther current solutions include using an `<ng-template>` if statement in components that require internal and external links, which can become very unmanageable over time and does not reflect DRY coding standards.\r\nAnother is to recreate the [`RouterLinkWithHref`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/directives/router_link.ts#L269-L437) directive as it cannot be successfully extended and replaced, which could then become outdated with new versions of Angular and also changes the directive selector to something custom which could confuse future developers on the project (granted this should be documented in the project).\r\n\r\nIn React it would be easy to create a custom component that can switch between rendering a React Router `<Link>` or an `<a>` element, using Fragments to not add extra DOM elements, and easily pass all props to it's children. There is no equivalent paradigm in Angular so another solution would have to be proposed.\r\n\r\nThis is a common feature which has been requested multiple times during Angular's life, that I have not seen an elegant solution for. I think there is a strong case for it to be handled natively within Angular, if the directive can not be extended and overriden.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAlthough this is [very badly written and rushed](https://gist.github.com/ChazUK/84014217b8e33b1af50f3706197fe65e#file-my-router-link-directive-ts-L102-L150), it is possible to combine the `commands` and use `new URL()` to see if the string is able to be converted into a URL and then checking the origin to the current locations origin to detect if it is an external link.\r\n\r\nThe `createUrlTree` method can then be bypassed and the href updated with a standard string, and the click event stopped before it hits the `locationStrategy` service to route via the Angular Router.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI haven't dug too far into on my initial discovery phase, but this could be part of the `createUrlTree` method, looking for protocols and hostnames in the supplied commands and then matching origins to then determine if the link is external or not. This would then allow queryParams and fragments to be handled in an \"Angular\" way using the appropriate directive inputs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44860","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"RouterLink to support External Links\" (#44860)"},{"Id":"1116304216","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-27T14:44:07","Actor":"wupaz","Number":"44859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wrong warning : ng8102","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWrong warning in this case \r\n\r\nExemple : \r\nwarning NG8102: The left side of this nullish coalescing operation does not include 'null' or 'undefined' in its type, therefore the '??' operator can be safely removed.\r\n\r\n<td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.CurrentLock?.Clinician?.Label ??

Status:\nFound 1 outside collaborators with push access.\nThis policy requires all users with this access to be members of the organisation. That way you can easily audit who has access to your repo, and if an account is compromised it can quickly be denied access to organization resources. To fix this you should either remove the user from repository-based access, or add them to the organization. \n\n* Remove the user from the repository-based access. From the main page of the repository, go to Settings -> Manage Access. \n(For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository)\n\nOR\n\n* Invite the user to join your organisation. Click your profile photo and choose “Your Organization” → choose the org name → “People” → “Invite Member.” (For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization)\n\nIf you don't see the Settings tab you probably don't have administrative access. Reach out to the administrators of the organisation to fix this issue.\n\n\nThis issue will auto resolve when the policy is in compliance.\n\nIssue created by Allstar.

Using https://v12.angular.io/guide/web-worker\r\n2. I added web-worker via cli to my poject.. it added a tsconfig file.. updated my angular.json etc.\r\n3. I moved my webworker code into a service and updated paths..\r\n    ` Worker = new Worker(new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url));`\r\n4. Everything ran fine in chrome.. but now IE11 was throwing `Object doesn't not support this action`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What  was wrong\r\n\r\n### First Issue\r\nAfter farting around for a few hours (adding shims.. looking at compiled code etc etc).. i realized the actual file in the dist folder was not `.js` but still a `.ts` file!  The url being provided to the Worker via (`new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url)`) was `...../survey/super-logic.ts`.. and obviously IE11 didnt like that. (`/survey` is my dist/route)\r\n\r\n**My Fix**: Changed the worker to a `js` file and edited the `tsconfig.webworker.ts` to only include `.js` files:\r\n```\r\n  \"include\": [\r\n    \"src/**/*.worker.js\"\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Second Issue\r\nDuring my debugging... I added console logs to my service to print out the url to the service worker.  For some reason, IE11 was producing a different URL than what Chrome was.\r\n- Chrome: `...mydomain.local/survey/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\n- IE11: `...mydomain.local/survey/take/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\nSo again.. obviously IE could not find the file...   The service was provided in root.. but it might be important to note that this service was being injected from a module which was being lazy-loaded.\r\n\r\n**My Fix**:  Since all the files are dumped in root of the dist folder... I just hard-coded the path to the dist folder into service and used the generated filename provided by the new URL:\r\n```javascript\r\n      const url = new URL('./../../shared/workers/logic-worker.worker', import.meta.url);\r\n      // IE11 hack.. for some reason this is wrong.. just force to dist folder root\r\n      const finalUrl = `/survey/${url.toString().split('/').pop()}`;\r\n      this.worker = new Worker(finalUrl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps others with this issue if nothing else.

Based on our initial testing, in Angular 13 the issue only affects the `scripts.js` file in the distribution build.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt seems that some output files' file name hashes are generated incorrectly, when building with output hashing (e.g. `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`). This can cause issues e.g. for Angular applications served from CDNs, where only changed files are uploaded, and the files are diff’d based on their revhash in the filename.\r\n\r\nIn our concrete case (Angular 13, having `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`), when changing the TypeScript target version from `es2017` to any of `es2019`, `es2020`, or `es2021` in the project’s `tsconfig.json`, then rebuilding the project, the file name hash of the generated output file containing global scripts (in our case, the file is named per the default configuration `scripts.js`) does not change, **even though the contents of the `scripts.js` generated output file itself changes.**\r\n\r\n**The expected behaviour is that the revhash generated into any output file’s filename should change if (and only if) the final contents of the output file changes.**\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Clone [https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction](https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction).\r\n2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.\r\n3. Run `ng build --configuration=production` (with the default `es2017` target in `tsconfig.json`).\r\n4. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_1}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch(c){}`.\r\n5. Change the `compilerOptions.target` to `es2019` (or `es2020` or `es2021`) from `es2017` in `tsconfig.json`.\r\n6. Run `ng build --configuration=production`.\r\n7. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_2}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch{}` (different from the output from step 4).\r\n8. Observe that `revhash_1` equals `revhash_2`.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.4\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nIt’s a long shot and we’re not sure whether it’s even connected, but we’ve found that hashing for the scripts doesn’t use `contenthash`, which might be relevant: \r\n\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Output files' filename hashes are incorrect\" (#22602)"},{"Id":"1117538554","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T15:34:18","Actor":"fischeversenker","Number":"22600","RawContent":null,"Title":"Defaults are not applied when using $refs in json schema","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] `ng generate` / `schematics`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI don't know, sorry.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI noticed that the `schematics` CLI is applying defaults in a schema differently, depending on whether a property is defined \"inline\" or defined in a reference using `$ref`. This applies to both `ng generate` and `schematics`.\r\n\r\nAssume this schema for a schematic:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\r\n  \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n    \"Reference\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"inlineProperty\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"referencedProperty\": {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Reference\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"type\": \"object\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a schematic that uses this schema is called without any arguments, the `options` object that it receives looks like this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, that it does not contain the `referencedProperty`, even though it uses the same exact schema - only it's referencing it. If the contents of the reference are copied into the `referencedProperty`, then the same default-logic is applied to it and the `options` object turns into this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false, referencedProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the `schematics` schema validation to apply the same logic for defaults, regardless of whether properties are defined \"inline\" or as a reference.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI provided a minimal setup in [this repository](https://github.com/fischeversenker/angular-schematics-defaults-bug).

else relevant?**\r\nWorth noting that `cal-heatmap` is using quite old version of `d3.js v3`, but I still hope there is a way to make it work with angular v13.\r\n\r\nThe same bundle works fine with

Importing a file with the `file` loader causes the imported file to be copied to the output directory and causes the imported value to be the relative path from the output JS file to that copied file. This bug meant that if the `--asset-names=` setting also contained `[hash]` and the file loaded with the `file` loader was changed, the hash in the copied file name would change but the hash of the JS file would not change, which could potentially result in a stale JS file being loaded. Now the hash of the JS file will be changed too which fixes the reload issue.\n\n-   Prefer the `import` condition for entry points ([#&#8203;1956](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1956))\n\n    The `exports` field in `package.json` maps package subpaths to file paths. The mapping can be conditional, which lets it vary in different situations. For example, you can have an `import` condition that applies when the subpath originated from a JS import statement, and a `require` condition that applies when the subpath originated from a JS require call. These are supposed to be mutually exclusive according to the specification: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports.\n\n    However, there's a situation with esbuild where it's not immediately obvious which one should be applied: when a package name is specified as an entry point. For example, this can happen if you do `esbuild --bundle some-pkg` on the command line. In this situation `some-pkg` does not originate from either a JS import statement or a JS require call. Previously esbuild just didn't apply the `import` or `require` conditions. But that could result in path resolution failure if the package doesn't provide a back-up `default` condition, as is the case with the `is-plain-object` package.\n\n    Starting with this release, esbuild will now use the `import` condition in this case. This appears to be how Webpack and Rollup handle this situation so this change makes esbuild consistent with other tools in the ecosystem. Parcel (the other major bundler) just doesn't handle this case at all so esbuild's behavior is not at odds with Parcel's behavior here.\n\n-   Make parsing of invalid `@keyframes` rules more robust ([#&#8203;1959](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1959))\n\n    This improves esbuild's parsing of certain malformed `@keyframes` rules to avoid them affecting the following rule. This fix only affects invalid CSS files, and does not change any behavior for files containing valid CSS. Here's an example of the fix:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x { . }\n    @&#8203;keyframes y { 1% { a: b; } }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x{y{1% {a: b;}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x{.}@&#8203;keyframes y{1%{a:b}}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v12.0.3`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This logic breaks when a component/directive/pipe that injects the `ActivatedRoute` is located within a `@defer` block, because defer creates an `EnvironmentInjector` instance, which doesn't have that dynamic logic.\r\n\r\nWe've added some special handling of the `OutletInjector` in one of the previous commits, but it was incomplete and it was not covering cases when different routes use the same component. This commit updates defer logic to re-establish this dynamic behavior for `ActivatedRoute` by creating an instance of the `OutletInjector` when a parent injector was also an instance of `OutletInjector`.\r\n\r\nThis fix is a short-term solution and longer term we should find a way to achieve the dynamic behavior that Router relies on, but without adding a special case logic into defer.\r\n\r\nResolves #54864.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55374","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): make `ActivatedRoute` inject correct instance inside `@defer` blocks\" (#55374)"},{"Id":"2247061642","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-17T00:11:10","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"55373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"refactor(core): warn about duplicated keys when using built-i…","State":"closed","Body":"…n @for (#55243)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 9f7b9ed87a671d4df5d9e519d57a78d718f44524.

`<mat-tab>`.\r\nUsing this mixin a padding appears (I could not backtrack where it comes from yet) and even if the best scenario is to wrap our texts into their appropriate tag elements, It's still a

I know its a lot of work but it would be great to have it in the documentation. I would put there some of the most common ways to style a component. For example for mat card how to remove elevation. For buttons how to change colors outside of the primary. We all love material design but we need these things to make our apps feel like our apps. \r\n\r\nIn the styling guide how are we supposed to know what mat.define-dark-theme properties etc. We need more documentation about those. \r\n\r\nI find myself googling these simple things every time i am implementing some of the designs and it is frustrating.

By doing so, we can create another DialogContainer aside from CdkDialogContainer, e.g. LeaveAnimationAwareDialogContainer, which performs a leave animation that does nothing but `animateChild()`.

During adding the sort functionality to the tables I've experienced very strange behaviors of MatSort. In some components the setter of MatSort is executed multiple times and in other components just once.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I have to handle the MatSort in components where it's only set once differently as in the components where it's set multiple times.\r\n\r\nI've searched for reasons.

The strange thing is that two of all components are almost the same but in one component the MatSort's setter is executed multiple times and in the other just once. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nI don't know how I can reproduce the bug, because both components I speak about in the description set the table's data-source initially `public dataSource = new MatTableDataSource<Data2>();` and overwrite it after the data is set asynchron` this.dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(this.data);`. In some components the MatSort's setter is exeuted again if this.dataSource has been overwritten. \r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-omvcop?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponent-two%2Fcomponent-two.component.ts\r\n\r\nIn the Stackblitz you can see that I have to assign the matSort's-value to a private property in **component one** where I load the data asynchron. \r\n\r\nIn **component two** the data is loaded synchron and the mat-sort works from the beginning. **Important**: In my application the data in component2 is loadad asynchon too, but has the behavior as if I would load the data synchron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality and behavior has to work for asynchron loaded data equal.  \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe table's sort functionality is different between two components that load the data asynchron.

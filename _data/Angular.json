This has unwanted side effects in some situations. The angular generated code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet AppComponent = class AppComponent {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.title = 'demo-app';\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nAppComponent.…µfac = function AppComponent_Factory(t) { \r\n    return new (t || AppComponent)(); // Here, due to the fact that the AppComponent class was declared in the same context as the bellow code, the class modifications will be considered.\r\n };\r\n...\r\nAppComponent = (0,tslib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.__decorate)([\r\n    src_decorators__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.MyCustomDecoration\r\n], AppComponent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the factory function is created before applying the custom decorator. When targetting `es2017` (like the latest angular version in this moment) this works fine. \r\n\r\nBut, when targetting `esnext`, for example, the generated code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet AppComponent = class AppComponent {\r\n    title = 'demo-app';\r\n    static …µfac = function AppComponent_Factory(t) { \r\n        return new (t || AppComponent)();  // Here, because the factory does not share the same context with where the factory is defined, the AppComponent class is the one before the modification.\r\n    };\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe issue appears when I am modifying the class inside the decorator, like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport function DecoratedClass(ctor: any): any {\r\n  const result = class extends ctor {\r\n    constructor(...args: Array<any>) {\r\n      super(...args);\r\n      console.log('i am a modified component', this);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the class changes will not be applied. \r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nYou can see here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ctvbax?file=tsconfig.json\r\n\r\nRun the project, check the console. You will see the text \"I am a modified component\". Now change in the `tsconfig.json` the target to `esnext` and run the project again. You will see that the text does not appear in console anymore.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.0\r\nNode: 14.15.4\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.10\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;531-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare530531-2022-03-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/5.3.0...5.3.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   condition on target instead of exec ([#&#8203;3373](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/3373)) ([43159a5](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/43159a5))\n-   **builtin:** require correct runfiles path to chdir script ([#&#8203;3374](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/3374)) ([9ed16c0](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/9ed16c0))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.29`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01429)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.28...v0.14.29)\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with a double-nested `if` inside a label followed by `else` ([#&#8203;2139](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2139))\n\n    This fixes a minification bug that affects the edge case where `if` is followed by `else` and the `if` contains a label that contains a nested `if`. Normally esbuild's AST printer automatically wraps the body of a single-statement `if` in braces to avoid the \"dangling else\" `if`/`else` ambiguity common to C-like languages (where the `else` accidentally becomes associated with the inner `if` instead of the outer `if`). However, I was missing automatic wrapping of label statements, which did not have test coverage because they are a rarely-used feature. This release fixes the bug:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if (a)\n      b: {\n        if (c) break b\n      }\n    else if (d)\n      e()\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    if(a)e:if(c)break e;else d&&e();\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    if(a){e:if(c)break e}else d&&e();\n    ```\n\n-   Fix edge case regarding `baseUrl` and `paths` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;2119](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2119))\n\n    In `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript forbids non-relative values inside `paths` if `baseUrl` is not present, and esbuild does too. However, TypeScript checked this after the entire `tsconfig.json` hierarchy was parsed while esbuild incorrectly checked this immediately when parsing the file containing the `paths` map. This caused incorrect warnings to be generated for `tsconfig.json` files that specify a `baseUrl` value and that inherit a `paths` value from an `extends` clause. Now esbuild will only check for non-relative `paths` values after the entire hierarchy has been parsed to avoid generating incorrect warnings.\n\n-   Better handle errors where the esbuild binary executable is corrupted or missing ([#&#8203;2129](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2129))\n\n    If the esbuild binary executable is corrupted or missing, previously there was one situation where esbuild's JavaScript API could hang instead of generating an error. This release changes esbuild's library code to generate an error instead in this case.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/npm-package-arg</summary>\n\n### [`v9.0.2`](https://togithub.com/npm/npm-package-arg/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;902-httpsgithubcomnpmnpm-package-argcomparev901v902-2022-03-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/npm-package-arg/compare/v9.0.1...v9.0.2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nüìÖ **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\nüö¶ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_1}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch(c){}`.\r\n1. Change the `compilerOptions.target` to `es2019` (or `es2020` or `es2021`) from `es2017` in tsconfig.json.\r\n1. Run `ng build --configuration=production`.\r\n1. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_2}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch{}` (different from the output from step 4).\r\n1.

Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\n\r\nThis Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors, and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.\"\r\n\r\nGoing further in the criterion we can see an example that states it using a graphical example (in this case a checkbox but it is applicable for any interactable component):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26325600/160797376-10d91823-c408-4d5a-88eb-44d9e4b34237.png)\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This has made my life MUCH easier because the team at Google Fonts did an amazing job with their search / UI / etc. Probably a different issue to request, but it would be nice if Google Fonts gave you the `<mat-icon>icon</mat-icon>` markup as one of the options, but I digress.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see some documentation on the Icon component page that at least mentions this link to search for Material Icons since per the current docs: \r\n> By default, `<mat-icon>` expects the [Material icons font](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web). \r\n\r\nAlso, it wasn't obvious how the Outlined vs Rounded vs Two Tone styles are applied to <mat-icon> but once I found the site and noticed a class name was necessary, it became clear. I think the documentation is lacking in this respect as well\r\n\r\nYes I know that the `<mat-icon>` supports other fonts, but if the \"default\" expectation is a material icon, it would be great to a section in the docs on how to properly use it.\r\n\r\nFor example, this issue could be closed with proper documentation: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22845\r\nAnother related issue that was created due to inadequate documentation: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/11544\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/icon","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24699","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(Icon): Providing additional information to search icons at https://fonts.google.com/icons and being a bit clearer on how to use the different styles (Outlined, Two Tone, etc.)\" (#24699)"},{"Id":"1184024618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T17:52:19","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"24683","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code to 3ff6a9e","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `03f784a` -> `3ff6a9e` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `9b5b3d4` -> `129a5cc` |\n\nüî° If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nüìÖ **Schedule**: At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nüö¶ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This was now fixed with the recent Rules NodeJS\r\nv5 update where I made sure the `env.sh` variables are actually available before we\r\nwrite them to the temporary file for the Bazel-access.\r\n\r\nThis now will unveil an issue because payload size goldens would start being based\r\non their branch name. e.g. the golden key in `13.3.x` should not be `master` but\r\n`13.3.x`. This makes more sense than `master` as key, but makes things more\r\ncumbersome and ideally we would not store the branch name at all (this is a larger\r\nchange though -- not worth now since we might refactor this anyway -- the payload limits\r\nare always based on the currently checked-out branch/revision). For now we will\r\nupdate the size tracking logic to always use `master` as golden key (like it worked\r\nin the past year(s))\r\n\r\nWith the environment fix we now (again) start uploading payload size results to Firebase.\r\nThis did not work by accident either. The uploading logic is reliant on the CircleCI\r\ncommit range which is not working/reliable in upstream branches. This commit\r\nremoves this reliance on `COMMIT_RANGE` since it's not strictly necessary and\r\ncurrently breaking renovate PRs. We can re-enable this when we have a solution with\r\nCircleCI, or a workaround/resolution logic provided in e.g. `ng-dev ci determine-commit-range`.\r\n\r\n(Internal discussion for later reference: https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C029MM6RS4B/p1648240555186009)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45444","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: make payload size tracking script work with CircleCI and Bazel limitations\" (#45444)"},{"Id":"1181219991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-25T20:45:12","Actor":"devversion","Number":"45443","RawContent":null,"Title":"[13.3.x]: update to rules nodejs v5","State":"closed","Body":"Patch port of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45431","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[13.3.x]: update to rules nodejs v5\" (#45443)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1185370409","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T20:51:53","Actor":"marko164","Number":"22911","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng generate with --style=none","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running `ng generate component` with `--style=none`, created component has extra comma after templateUrl\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<pre><code>ng generate component test-component --style=none</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'test-component',\r\n  templateUrl: './test-component.component.html',, <-------------\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponentComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.0\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22911","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng generate with --style=none\" (#22911)"},{"Id":"1184856278","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T16:20:56","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"22909","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): remove analytics prompt postinstall script","State":"closed","Body":"With this change we remove the postinstall hook that was used to prompt users to confirm if they'd like to share anonymous usage with the Angular team.\r\n\r\nThis post install hook was used to set the global configuration, which was mainly used for commands that run outside of a workspace such as `ng new`, `ng version` and ng `config`.

See https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a for more information.\r\n⠋ Generating browser application bundles (phase: setup)...An unhandled exception occurred: Dev-server address info is not defined.\r\nSee \"/private/var/folders/62/m5vqsbd1251d77334_xl_4x40000gp/T/ng-G32x8J/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n⠙ Generating browser application bundles (phase: setup)...Warning: Task \"ng:serve\" failed. Use --force to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe error is caused by this code in webpack.cli.js:\r\n```\r\ndevServer.setupMiddlewares = (middlewares, devServer) => {\r\n\t\t\tif (!devServer) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthrow new Error('webpack-dev-server is not defined');\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tdevServer.app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {\r\n\t\t\t\tres.set({ 'Content-Security-Policy': props.devServer.csp });\r\n\t\t\t\tnext();\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used devServer.before before upgrading from Angular 12 to 13.\r\n\r\nThe error from the mentioned angular-errors.log:\r\n```\r\n[error] Error: Dev-server address info is not defined.\r\n    at xyz/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-webpack/src/webpack-dev-server/index.js:63:27\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich relates to this code snippet from @angular-devkit/build-webpack/src/webpack-dev-server/index.js\r\n```\r\nconst address = (_a = devServer.server) === null || _a === void 0 ? void 0 : _a.address();\r\n            if (!address) {\r\n                obs.error(new Error(`Dev-server address info is not defined.`));\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that devServer.server is not defined. I debugged it with this command:\r\n`node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/ng serve`\r\n\r\nAnd I could see that the server property is not directly on the devServer object, instead it's nested one level deeper in an options object:\r\n```\r\ndevServer = {\r\noptions: {\r\nserver: ...\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: Dev-server address info is not defined.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.0\r\nNode: 14.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1303.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               13.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         13.3.0\r\n@angular/cdk                       13.3.1\r\n@angular/material                  13.3.1\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   13.3.1\r\n@schematics/angular                13.3.0\r\nrxjs                               6.6.3\r\ntypescript                         4.6.2\r\nwebpack                            5.70.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22903","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"An unhandled exception occurred: Dev-server address info is not defined\" (#22903)"},{"Id":"1183368451","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T11:35:13","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"22900","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow Workers in Stackblitz","State":"closed","Body":"This is no longer needed as Stackblitz implemented the missing Node.Js worker APIs.//cc @d3lm from StackBlitz.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22900","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow Workers in Stackblitz\" (#22900)"},{"Id":"1184129812","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T00:08:11","Actor":"JoshuaEN","Number":"22906","RawContent":null,"Title":"Output files' filename hashes are incorrect (reopening #22602)","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 11 (per original bug report, I did not test this)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nReopening #22602 \r\nIf I understand correctly, per https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1322-2022-02-02, this should be fixed in 13.2.2 and higher (since the main PR [#22612] associated with [ff54b49e7](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/ff54b49e7097cda2eb835bc8c9674f71fcc91c3c) closed #22602 ) .

Clone https://github.com/JoshuaEN/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction\r\n1. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.\r\n1. Run `ng build --configuration=production` (with the default es2017 target in tsconfig.json).\r\n1. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_1}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch(c){}`.\r\n1. Change the `compilerOptions.target` to `es2019` (or `es2020` or `es2021`) from `es2017` in tsconfig.json.\r\n1. Run `ng build --configuration=production`.\r\n1. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_2}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch{}` (different from the output from step 4).\r\n1. Observe that revhash_1 equals revhash_2.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __

[`v14.0.0-next.8`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next8-2022-03-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.7...14.0.0-next.8)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.6 are no longer supported.\n\n##### zone.js\n\n-   in TaskTrackingZoneSpec track a periodic task until it is cancelled\n\nThe breaking change is scoped only to the plugin\n`zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\nchecked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner\n._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\nits behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\npreviously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\ncallback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\nthe task is explicitly cancelled, e.g  with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\nfixes 45350\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [79d334b138](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/79d334b1385685d0fd1451534df2ed3cbaefa0b6) | feat | provide warnings for non-animatable CSS properties ([#&#8203;45212](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45212)) |\n| [2a75754ee8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2a75754ee823032e651bc596887a2186dc6846ae) | fix | apply default params when resolved value is null or undefined ([#&#8203;45339](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45339)) |\n\n##### bazel\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [dc72f3007a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dc72f3007ac74389ec02ea021a27f35770aa5a5d) | fix | ng module compilation workers are subject to linker race-conditions ([#&#8203;45393](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45393)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fffa023803](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fffa023803e5b04a58f0bd0b8667ee8b686aa530) | fix | scope css rules within `@layer` blocks ([#&#8203;45396](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45396)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [27b4af7240](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/27b4af7240ea964d1e4d51b83118f10321163627) | fix | full side-effectful registration of NgModules with ids ([#&#8203;45024](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45024)) |\n| [8155428ba6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8155428ba65c38c0c15f2666727202a7b360c1bd) | perf | ignore the module.id anti-pattern for NgModule ids ([#&#8203;45024](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45024)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c9d566ce4b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c9d566ce4b6e9097d9eceb7ac3964a0b25c404ad) | feat | drop support for TypeScript 4.4 and 4.5 ([#&#8203;45394](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45394)) |\n| [be161bef79](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/be161bef798ac5309df8390e3c2bba2cf84cb530) | fix | memory leak in event listeners inside embedded views ([#&#8203;43075](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/43075)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fe0e42a996](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fe0e42a996d5b70f4c0923cb6570c9a8032b1298) | fix | Make UntypedFormBuilder assignable to FormBuilder, and vice versa.

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.28`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01428)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.27...v0.14.28)\n\n-   Add support for some new CSS rules ([#&#8203;2115](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2115), [#&#8203;2116](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2116), [#&#8203;2117](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2117))\n\n    This release adds support for [`@font-palette-values`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-palette-values), [`@counter-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;counter-style), and [`@font-feature-values`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;font-feature-values). This means esbuild will now pretty-print and minify these rules better since it now better understands the internal structure of these rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;font-palette-values Foo { base-palette: 1; }\n    @&#8203;counter-style bar { symbols: b a r; }\n    @&#8203;font-feature-values Bop { @&#8203;styleset { test: 1; } }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;font-palette-values Foo{base-palette: 1;}@&#8203;counter-style bar{symbols: b a r;}@&#8203;font-feature-values Bop{@&#8203;styleset {test: 1;}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;font-palette-values Foo{base-palette:1}@&#8203;counter-style bar{symbols:b a r}@&#8203;font-feature-values Bop{@&#8203;styleset{test:1}}\n    ```\n\n-   Upgrade to Go 1.18.0 ([#&#8203;2105](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2105))\n\n    Binary executables for this version are now published with Go version 1.18.0. The [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18) say that the linker generates smaller binaries and that on 64-bit ARM chips, compiled binaries run around 10% faster. On an M1 MacBook Pro, esbuild's benchmark runs approximately 8% faster than before and the binary executable is approximately 4% smaller than before.\n\n    This also fixes a regression from version 0.14.26 of esbuild where the browser builds of the `esbuild-wasm` package could fail to be bundled due to the use of built-in node libraries. The primary WebAssembly shim for Go 1.18.0 no longer uses built-in node libraries.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.12.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/v8.12.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.11.0...v8.12.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`685a67a`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/685a67a62bdea19ca9ce12008a034b8d31162422) feat: fix logic for top-level `this` in no-invalid-this and no-eval ([#&#8203;15712](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15712)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`18f5e05`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/18f5e05bce10503186989d81ca484abb185a2c9d) chore: padding-line-between-statements remove useless `additionalItems` ([#&#8203;15706](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15706)) (Martin Sadovy)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js</summary>\n\n### [`v8.2.2`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases/inquirer@8.2.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@8.2.1...inquirer@8.2.2)\n\nFix bugs with the `rawlist`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Description\r\n\r\nRight now there is an opportunity to use `NodePackageInstallTask` when authoring schematics. This works well but there are cases when running simple `npm install` is not enough. For example, last version of NPM might throw \"Unable to resolve dependency tree\" error. This can be easily fixed with an `--legacy-peer-deps` option. Unfortunately, this option is not available for `NodePackageInstallTask`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd ability to provide `legacyPeerDeps` option to `NodePackageInstallTask`. Even better solution would be to add opportunity to provide any custom options to `NodePackageInstallTask`. They should be passed down to command line automatically.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've tried to write my own `NodePackageInstallTask` with an extra option. But this didn't work. I've discovered that provided options are just meta-data for the executor (https://github.dev/angular/angular-cli/blob/366cabc66c3dd836e2fdfea8dad6c4c7c2096b1d/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.ts#L112). From executor code it is clear that there is a predefined set of options for NPM task and there is no way to override or extend this.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add legacyPeerDeps option to NodePackageInstallTask\" (#22886)"},{"Id":"1178182968","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-23T14:14:24","Actor":"Oznaprazzi","Number":"22885","RawContent":null,"Title":"Absolute paths broken in Angular 12+ for templateUrl and styleUrls","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am using Angular 13, upgraded from Angular 11 but after upgrading to Angular 12, the absolute paths stopped working for templateUrl and styleUrls.\r\n\r\nWhen I was with Angular 11, I had the AOT complier on and it was working.\r\n\r\nI'm needing to use absolute paths because I want to avoid having long relative paths and a lot of my components are using shared ```.scss``` and ```.html``` files for showing delete/restore confirm dialogs etc.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what I currently have in the components for templateUrl and styleUrls which is not working in Angular 12+ but still working in Angular 11.\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nIf I change the above to use relative path like below then it works but it doesn't look nice to have so many ```../../../```\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '../../../../example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['../../../../example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis is the templateUrl error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: path/to/directory/something.component.ts:9:18 - error NG2008: Could not find template file 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html'.\r\n\r\ntemplateUrl: 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html',\r\n```\r\nThis is the styleUrls error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss?ngResource' in 'C:\\Users\\...\\frontend'\r\n\r\nError: The loader \"C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss\" didn't return a string.\r\n```\r\nI've also tried adding paths like below to my tsconfig but it doesn't affect anything.\r\n```\r\n \"paths\": {\r\n      \"@env\": [\r\n        \"environments/environment\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@shared/*\": [\r\n        \"app/shared/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@core/*\": [\r\n        \"app/core/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"~*\": [\r\n        \"src/*\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI've seen answers suggesting to use raw-loader but I'm not quite sure how it works and if that's even the right solution here.

I think the documentation is lacking in this respect as well\r\n\r\nYes I know that the `<mat-icon>` supports other fonts, but if the \"default\" expectation is a material icon, it would be great to a section in the docs on how to properly use it.\r\n\r\nFor example, this issue could be closed with proper documentation: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22845\r\nAnother related issue that was created due to inadequate documentation: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/11544\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/icon","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24699","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(Icon): Providing additional information to search icons at https://fonts.google.com/icons and being a bit clearer on how to use the different styles (Outlined, Two Tone, etc.)\" (#24699)"},{"Id":"1184024618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T17:52:19","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"24683","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code to 3ff6a9e","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `03f784a` -> `3ff6a9e` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `9b5b3d4` -> `129a5cc` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This can be summarized very well [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54740466/1938094).\r\n\r\nIt's confusing to me why the `activatedRoute.parent` and `activatedRoute.children` and `activateRoute.firstChild` are not observables.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it would be nice if there was something like `paramsInheritanceStrategy` for the parent to access the child components.\r\n\r\nUsing the [collectRouteParams](https://github.com/atscott/angular/commit/2119dfe5089b1a20c01b031ab0eca85743e9b1e0#diff-d6e369b3564501d71a88c259725c2575a6a567df88a1fe5289a1a5713cc8de07R308) is not a good solution because that's built on `snapshot` which doesn't work if the child changes or children change.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nRight now, the best solution is to use something like this, which isn't good for something that's needed so often:\r\n```\r\nconst firstChildParams$ = this.router.events.pipe(filter(e => e instanceof NavigationEnd),\r\n

Most notably, it contains a proxy to the API (so that it can be deployed separately, but accessed by the browser on the same domain), but also some other special proxies like the webmanifest file, a styling file that the API generates (tenant specific) and a special reroute for print specific rendering.\r\n\r\nWhile I was trying to get the new application builder to work with our code, I noticed that while running `ng serve`, the `server.ts` file is completely ignored. Only when running `ng build` and then running the output does this file get included. \r\n\r\nThis is a change that I could not find documented anywhere and I'm wondering what the reason for this change is.

You can see that when navigating to the radio button via keyboard the tooltip is shown, but when doing the same to the checkbox, nothing is displayed.\r\n\r\nI looked over the tooltip code where the [events are being monitored](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/material/tooltip/tooltip.ts#L376-L387). This fires on the keyboard focus event for the radio, but not for the checkbox.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the second parameter of the `monitor` method is left default, which is `false`, this means that it will not check if an event was fired on a children. For radio buttons and checkboxes the event (focus) is fired on a children, on the input. So it is strange that for the radio button this works.\r\n\r\nLooking into the FocusMonitor code, I saw that on the focus event (`_onFocus`), [elementInfo](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/cdk/a11y/focus-monitor/focus-monitor.ts#L425) came with `checkChildren` on `true` for the radio, but on `false` for the checkbox. Now, on the tooltip code, all the monitors have the default value for `checkChildren` which is false.\r\n\r\nI looked after this in the radio code and saw that the `monitor` is [called with checkChildren on true](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/material/radio/radio.ts#L561). So this is why the tooltip fires on the radio.\r\n\r\nBut the tooltip did fire on the checkbox in v14 too; not anymore now in the new MDC checkbox, there is no monitor called with `checkChildren` on `true`. If you open the legacy checkbox code, you can see that it was, so that is why it worked before.\r\n\r\nSo this worked before and still works using the same mechanism for other elements (like radio, but probably others too), but seems like a strange way, since the tooltip doesn't fire because of the monitor inside the tooltip directive, but a custom monitor inside the respective components.\r\n\r\nCould the tooltip monitor all the elements using `checkChildren` on `true` or do you think it could cause issues?\r\n\r\nTested this on v15, but probably is the same for v16 and v17.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/hvjxck?file=src%2Fapp%2Fradio-overview-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the checkbox via tab key\r\n2.

We include mat.core(), and we build on that. It seems that in v17, the base non-themed CSS for many (all?) components, as defined in the published .mjs files, no longer include fallback values for when the --mdc* variables are not defined. Take slider for example. Here is a rule published in 16.x as part of slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape, 50%); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn v17, there is no fallback value in slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am guessing this change was intentional, but not having those fallback values is breaking the styling of our applications. For example, given the lack of the above fallback, the slider thumb knob is no longer rounded How can we get the default values present in 16.x to be present in 17? Is there some way to set the variables to their defaults?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-cawym5\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

_(e.g. a component that uses `setTimeout` or `setInterval`)_, Angular provides means to manipulate time in tests using the `fakeAsync` function _(+ associated functions like `tick`, `flush`, `flushMicrotasks` etc...)_.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach offers a testing framework agnostic approach of manipulating time, it has the following limitations:\r\n\r\n- It requires Zone.js, so by definition, **it is not zoneless-ready**.\r\n- As it requires Zone.js, it also requires `async/await` to be downleveled during the build process.\r\n- It doesn't provide a way of controlling the clock _(e.g. set current date, then tick and finally observe the date change)_.\r\n- It requires the system under test to be executed in a fake zone, which can make it more challenging to integrate with some untraditional testing patterns.\r\n\r\nThe most important point here is that this is not zoneless-ready.\r\n\r\n<!-- TOC -->\r\n* [Proposed Solutions and

Using 3rd party fake timers\r\n\r\nThe most common fake timer around is [`@sinonjs/fake-timers`](https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers). Previously known as `lolex`. It is used under the hood in Jest, Vitest, etc...\r\n\r\nThe solutions below are based on this library as an example but in general, any fake timer library can be used and the same principles & problems apply. 😅\r\n\r\n### 1.1. Using 3rd party fake timers + \"real\" `requestAnimationFrame`\r\n\r\nThe first problem we have is that we can't make any general assumption on what which functions will be faked by a fake timer library.\r\n\r\nJust as an example, the default configurations can vary:\r\n\r\n| Tool                   | Default configuration for faking `rAF` |\r\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\r\n| `@sinonjs/fake-timers` | true                                   |\r\n| Jest                   | true                                   |\r\n| Vitest                 | false                                  |\r\n\r\nBy making sure that `rAF` is not faked (which is harder than one might think, cf. below), users can rely on `ComponentFixture#whenStable()` making the test look something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nvi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ['setTimeout'] });\r\n\r\ntest('should say hello after 1s', async () => {\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreetingsComponent);\r\n\r\n  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1000);\r\n\r\n  await fixture.whenStable();\r\n\r\n  expect(fixture.nativeElement.textContent).toBe('Hello!');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]  \r\n> Given vitest defaults of not faking `rAF`, it might feel that `vi.useFakeTimers()` would be enough but it's not!\r\n> The problem is that the result will vary depending on the testing environment you are using (real browser, happy-dom, jsdom, etc...).\r\n>\r\n> For example:\r\n> `jsdom` is using `setInterval` under the hood to emulate `rAF` _(i.e. `setInterval(callback, 1000 / 60)`)_ but as `setInterval` is faked by default, `rAF` will be faked as well.\r\n> `happy-dom` uses `setImmediate` to emulate `rAF`. Luckily it grabs the real `setImmediate` function before it is faked so it will always work.\r\n\r\nThis means that while Angular could detect if `rAF` is faked and provide a warning, it would still not be enough.\r\nAngular would have to implement heuristics to detect environments like `jsdom` where the provided implementation relies on `setInterval` and provide a warning if `setInterval` is faked in that case.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it impossible to fake both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` when using `jsdom` _(except if `jsdom` is changed similarly to `happy-dom` in order to grab the original `setInterval` before it is faked)_.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]  \r\n> By default Jest also fakes `queueMicrotask` which is used by Angular to schedule microtasks.\r\n>\r\n> Users must make sure that `queueMicrotask` is not faked when using Jest by adding it to the `doNotFake` option.\r\n\r\n#### Pros & Cons\r\n\r\n- 👍 The test in itself is straightforward\r\n- 👍 This doesn't require any framework changes.\r\n- 🛑 This is not perfectly symmetric to production as this is equivalent of implementing a change detection scheduler that only relies on `rAF`, meaning that there are extreme cases where some macrotasks scheduled by the user could happen before the CD triggered by `rAF` while this wouldn't happen in production because CD would `setTimeout` would win the race.\r\n- 🛑 By relying on `rAF` only to schedule change detection, tests will be a bit slower.\r\n- 🛑 This approach is very fragile as it relies on the fact that `rAF` is not faked.\r\n\r\n### 1.2. Using 3rd party fake timers + fake `rAF`\r\n\r\nWith a fake timer that also fakes `rAF`, the app will simply never be stable as long as we don't flush the fake timers.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the following test will timeout:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nvi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ['setTimeout', 'requestAnimationFrame'] });\r\n\r\ntest('will timeout', async () => {\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreetingsComponent);\r\n\r\n  await fixture.whenStable(); // this never resolves\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore interestingly, (given the same fake timer configuration), the following test will also timeout:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntest('will timeout', async () => {\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreetingsComponent);\r\n\r\n  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1000);\r\n  await fixture.whenStable(); // this never resolves\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile this one will pass:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntest('will pass', async () => {\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreetingsComponent);\r\n\r\n  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1001);\r\n  await fixture.whenStable();\r\n  expect(fixture.nativeElement.textContent).toBe('Hello!');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is why:\r\n\r\n- the call to `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1000)` will trigger the callback from the `setTimeout(callback, 1000)` in the component,\r\n- by updating a signal, the callback, will notify the change detection scheduler to schedule a change detection cycle,\r\n- this cycle will be scheduled with a race between `setTimeout` and `rAF` which are faked and will only be triggered if we advance by an extra millisecond.\r\n\r\nThis extra millisecond is introduced on purpose by `@sinonjs/fake-timers` _(probably in order to provide more control when timers are \"nested\" or \"chained\")_.\r\n\r\nCf. https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers#:~:text=If%20called%20during%20a%20tick%20the%20callback%20won%27t%20fire%20until%201%20millisecond%20has%20ticked%20by.\r\n\r\n& https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers/blob/341203310225bf5cd3d7396b2fcf276c5e218347/src/fake-timers-src.js#L645C58-L645C68\r\n\r\nWhile there are workarounds to avoid this freeze, like advancing the timer millisecond by millisecond and checking the stability, they are not necessarily straightforward nor intuitive:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync function advanceTimeAndWaitStable(duration = 0) {\r\n  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(duration);\r\n  while (!fixture.isStable()) {\r\n    await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1);\r\n    duration++;\r\n  }\r\n  return duration;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `rAF` is faked, users need a deep understanding of the fake timer library and zoneless change detection scheduling.\r\n\r\n#### Pros & Cons\r\n\r\n- 👍 This solution is less fragile than the previous one as it doesn't require the user to make sure that `rAF` is not faked.\r\n- 👍 Tests are faster than using \"real\" `rAF` (Cf. [solution 1.1.](#11-using-3rd-party-fake-timers--real-requestanimationframe))\r\n- 👍 This doesn't require any framework changes.\r\n- 👍 This is a bit more symmetric to production than the previous solution.\r\n- 🛑 Tests have to somehow advance the timer to trigger CD and therefore they are less straightfoward than a simple call to `ComponentFixture#whenStable()`\r\n- 🛑 The extra millisecond can be annoying.\r\n\r\n## 2. Using a microtask change detection scheduler for testing\r\n\r\nBy providing a microtask change detection scheduler instead of the zoneless one (`setTimeout` & `rAF` race), tests are more straightforward as extra change detection cycles will be triggered in the same timer tick (so no extra 1ms introduced by `@sinonjs/fake-timers`).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ɵprovideZonelessChangeDetection(),\r\n    {\r\n      provide: ɵChangeDetectionScheduler,\r\n      useExisting: TestingChangeDetectionScheduler,\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n\r\nawait vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1000);\r\nawait fixture.whenStable();\r\n\r\nexpect(fixture.nativeElement.textContent).toBe('Hello!');\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Pros & Cons\r\n\r\n- 👍 Tests are straightforward.\r\n- 👍 Timers are precise.\r\n- 👍 Tests are faster than using \"real\" `rAF` (Cf. [solution 1.1.](#11-using-3rd-party-fake-timers--real-requestanimationframe))\r\n- 👍 This solution is less fragile as it doesn't require the user to make sure that `rAF` is not faked.\r\n- 🛑 This is not symmetric to production.\r\n\r\n## 3. Introducing a `Timer` service\r\n\r\nThe abstraction + dependency injection approach in Angular has proven to be very powerful. Why not use it here too?\r\n\r\nAngular could introduce a `Timer` service wrapping native timers (i.e. `setTimeout`, `setInterval`) + an alternative fake implementation for testing.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n  providers: [provideTestingTimer()],\r\n});\r\nconst fakeTimer = TestBed.inject(Timer);\r\nawait fakeTimer.advanceBy(1000);\r\nawait fixture.whenStable();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also be name something like `TaskScheduler` and also wrap other scheduling functions like `requestIdleCallback`, etc...\r\n\r\n#### Pros & Cons\r\n\r\n- 👍 Tests are straightforward.\r\n- 👍 Timers are precise.\r\n- 👍 Tests are faster than using \"real\" `rAF` (Cf.

The\r\n  current logic attempts to link into `/node_modules`, but this does not\r\n  override existing `@angular/core`!\r\n- Linking all direct external NPM packages, like\r\n  `@angular_devkit/build-angular` into `adev/node_modules` without their\r\n  transitive deps. This allows proper resolution of e.g. compiler as\r\n  node looks in `adev/node_modules` first, and falls back for the rest\r\n  to the execroot `node_modules`, or symlink target destination (if\r\n  `preserveSymlinks=false`).\r\n\r\nNote: This is still not 100% ideal because a direct external NPM\r\ndependency may have a transitive dependency that has another transitive\r\ndependency on `@angular/core`.

generated correctly during `ng serve`.\r\n\r\nIn Firefox I even get a warning in the console:\r\n\r\n`Source map error: Error: request failed with status 404`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/131432701/96260925-b37d-487f-b23b-738f7f311a6a)\r\n\r\nResult is, that the DEV tools do not point to the correct css source file,

The migration went well - no errors, no warnings.\r\n\r\nSo I hade to update the main.ts in my app where I previously used platformBrowserDynamic into usage of bootstrapApplication. At least I though that's the problem - anyway main.ts, AppComponent, app-routing.module has been change for standalone usage (so no modules and everything according to docs)\r\n\r\nAnyway I am still facing this issue and I don't have any clue why. Previously there was somee issues with tslib (almost identical error message but it has dissapeared after updatint the mian.ts). I tried npm cache clean -f, delete node_modules and install all deps again. Even running nx migrate multiple times - everyting is updated to latest stable. \r\n\r\nI also tried [offical doc](https://angular.io/guide/esbuild#vite-as-a-development-server) steps for changing the builder just to \"esbuild\" - but absolutely the same issue (so I don't think so, it's related to Nx).\r\n\r\n**main.ts**\r\n```\r\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';\r\nimport { appConfig } from './app/app.config';\r\n\r\nconst configPath =

console.error(err));\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n**package.json:**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"cloud-cis\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.6.10\",\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n

The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to import a *.css file inside a *.ts with the following syntax:\r\n```ts\r\nimport './my-styles.css';\r\n```\r\nThe built css file is never loaded into the application.\r\nI was pointed out in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27414 that I should use the new `loader` however that does not seem to work.\r\n\r\n`angular.json`:\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": {\r\n  \".css\": \"file\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ng serve` output:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/9380964/f30a200b-9d1b-44b3-a3d3-93f39688d10d)\r\n\r\nThis would be useful in order to support third party libraries that use this kind of imports like `monaco-editor`.\r\n\r\nVite already handles this when we run `ng serve --prebundle=true` and it works when a library uses this imports, but it does not work with `ng build` or `ng serve --prebundle=false`.\r\nAlso esbuild is able to handle the import (https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css-from-js) and generate a css bundle for all the css imports that it finds in a entry point, for example I can see it generating a `main.css` file:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/9380964/1eb57b73-9526-4792-8086-73fbfed60fa2)\r\nHowever, the css bundle outputted to the ./dist/** folder it is never loaded onto the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nng new my-app\r\ncd ./my-app\r\n\r\nCreate a *.css file called \"import-styles.css\"\r\nImport the file above into the main.ts or other *.ts file of the app.\r\n\r\nng serve\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your

(ex: Whenever a docker dev environment is running on a windows host.) This is solved by adding poll option to the webpack dev server configuration.

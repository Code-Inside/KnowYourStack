So I started investigating whether it's my IDE's problem or not.\r\n\r\nLet's assume that we have a method in component, which accepts string as an argument. If we try to call it from a template with `undefined` or `null` explicitly, compiler would throw an error. However, this is not the case when library is involved. In my example [<mat-calendar>](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/api#MatCalendar) is used along with `(selectedChange)`.\r\n\r\n`$event` can be null. And if I try to call that method with `$event.toString()`, compiler would not complain. Even something like `$event?.toString()` or `$event?.toString() ?? undefined` or `$event?.toString() || undefined` would still be fine for the compiler.

This is a fork from the [official example](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview#using-mat-calendar-inline).\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- init strict application with `strictTemplates` & `strictNullChecks`\r\n- create component with a method, which accepts string as a single argument\r\n- call that method from the template using third-party library's component where `$event` can be `null`. E.g. `myMethod($event.toString())`\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThis is what I would actually expect to see in such case, but no error was given.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57644","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generic types of components/directives are inferred as `any` when some corresponding inputs are omitted\" (#57644)"},{"Id":"2503351202","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T16:55:45","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57643","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Add a schematics to migrate to `standalone: false`.","State":"open","Body":"With the framework enabling `standalone` by default (making module based an opt-in), the migration will migrate none-standalone existing components and add `standalone: false` to the decorator.\r\n\r\nThe migration will also remove `standalone: true` properties as they are now not necessary anymore","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57643","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): Add a schematics to migrate to `standalone: false`.\" (#57643)"},{"Id":"2501925060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T14:52:16","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"57634","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update babel dependencies to v7.25.6","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/cli](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-cli) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-cli)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.24.8` -> `7.25.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcli/7.24.8/7.25.6) |\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.25.5` -> `7.25.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.25.5/7.25.6) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/cli)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.25.6`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7256-2024-08-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.24.8...v7.25.6)\n\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n-   `babel-generator`\n    -

The objective of this release was to carry out a mass fix, in one go, of all the open bugs and design problems that required breaking changes to fix. A substantial, but exhaustive, changelog is below.\n\n[Commits](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/compare/master...v6.0.0-staging)\n\n-   [#&#8203;497](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/497) **`diffWords` behavior has been radically changed.** Previously, even with `ignoreWhitespace: true`, runs of whitespace were tokens, which led to unhelpful and unintuitive diffing behavior in typical texts. Specifically, even when two texts contained overlapping passages, `diffWords` would sometimes choose to delete all the words from the old text and insert them anew in their new positions in order to avoid having to delete or insert whitespace tokens. Whitespace sequences are no longer tokens as of this release, which affects both the generated diffs and the `count`s.\n\n    Runs of whitespace are still tokens in `diffWordsWithSpace`.\n\n    As part of the changes to `diffWords`, **a new `.postProcess` method has been added on the base `Diff` type**, which can be overridden in custom `Diff` implementations.\n\n    **`diffLines` with `ignoreWhitespace: true` will no longer ignore the insertion or deletion of entire extra lines of whitespace at the end of the text**. Previously, these would not show up as insertions or deletions, as a side effect of a hack in the base diffing algorithm meant to help ignore whitespace in `diffWords`. More generally, **the undocumented special handling in the core algorithm for ignored terminals has been removed entirely.** (This special case behavior used to rewrite the final two change objects in a scenario where the final change object was an addition or deletion and its `value` was treated as equal to the empty string when compared using the diff object's `.equals` method.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;500](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/500) **`diffChars` now diffs Unicode code points** instead of UTF-16 code units.\n\n-   [#&#8203;508](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/508) **`parsePatch` now always runs in what was previously \"strict\" mode; the undocumented `strict` option has been removed.** Previously, by default, `parsePatch` (and other patch functions that use it under the hood to parse patches) would accept a patch where the line counts in the headers were inconsistent with the actual patch content - e.g. where a hunk started with the header `@@&#8203; -1,3 +1,6 @&#8203;@&#8203;`, indicating that the content below spanned 3 lines in the old file and 6 lines in the new file, but then the actual content below the header consisted of some different number of lines, say 10 lines of context, 5 deletions, and 1 insertion. Actually trying to work with these patches using `applyPatch` or `merge`, however, would produce incorrect results instead of just ignoring the incorrect headers, making this \"feature\" more of a trap than something actually useful. It's been ripped out, and now we are always \"strict\" and will reject patches where the line counts in the headers aren't consistent with the actual patch content.\n\n-   [#&#8203;435](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/435) **Fix `parsePatch` handling of control characters.** `parsePatch` used to interpret various unusual control characters - namely vertical tabs, form feeds, lone carriage returns without a line feed, and EBCDIC NELs - as line breaks when parsing a patch file. This was inconsistent with the behavior of both JsDiff's own `diffLines` method and also the Unix `diff` and `patch` utils, which all simply treat those control characters as ordinary characters. The result of this discrepancy was that some well-formed patches - produced either by `diff` or by JsDiff itself and handled properly by the `patch` util - would be wrongly parsed by `parsePatch`, with the effect that it would disregard the remainder of a hunk after encountering one of these control characters.\n\n-   [#&#8203;439](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/439) **Prefer diffs that order deletions before insertions.** When faced with a choice between two diffs with an equal total edit distance, the Myers diff algorithm generally prefers one that does deletions before insertions rather than insertions before deletions. For instance, when diffing `abcd` against `acbd`, it will prefer a diff that says to delete the `b` and then insert a new `b` after the `c`, over a diff that says to insert a `c` before the `b` and then delete the existing `c`. JsDiff deviated from the published Myers algorithm in a way that led to it having the opposite preference in many cases, including that example. This is now fixed, meaning diffs output by JsDiff will more accurately reflect what the published Myers diff algorithm would output.\n\n-   [#&#8203;455](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/455) **The `added` and `removed` properties of change objects are now guaranteed to be set to a boolean value.** (Previously, they would be set to `undefined` or omitted entirely instead of setting them to false.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;464](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/464) Specifying `{maxEditLength: 0}` now sets a max edit length of 0 instead of no maximum.\n\n-   [#&#8203;460](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/460) **Added `oneChangePerToken` option.**\n\n-   [#&#8203;467](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/467) **Consistent ordering of arguments to `comparator(left, right)`.** Values from the old array will now consistently be passed as the first argument (`left`) and values from the new array as the second argument (`right`). Previously this was almost (but not quite) always the other way round.\n\n-   [#&#8203;480](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/480) **Passing `maxEditLength` to `createPatch` & `createTwoFilesPatch` now works properly** (i.e. returns undefined if the max edit distance is exceeded; previous behavior was to crash with a `TypeError` if the edit distance was exceeded).\n\n-   [#&#8203;486](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/486) **The `ignoreWhitespace` option of `diffLines` behaves more sensibly now.** `value`s in returned change objects now include leading/trailing whitespace even when `ignoreWhitespace` is used, just like how with `ignoreCase` the `value`s still reflect the case of one of the original texts instead of being all-lowercase. `ignoreWhitespace` is also now compatible with `newlineIsToken`. Finally, **`diffTrimmedLines` is deprecated** (and removed from the docs) in favour of using `diffLines` with `ignoreWhitespace: true`; the two are, and always have been, equivalent.\n\n-   [#&#8203;490](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/490) **When calling diffing functions in async mode by passing a `callback` option, the diff result will now be passed as the *first* argument to the callback instead of the second.** (Previously, the first argument was never used at all and would always have value `undefined`.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;489](redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/489) **`this.options` no longer exists on `Diff` objects.** Instead, `options` is now passed as an argument to methods that rely on options, like `equals(left, right, options)`. This fixes a race condition in async mode, where diffing behaviour could be changed mid-execution if a concurrent usage of the same `Diff` instances overwrote its `options`.\n\n-   [#&#8203;518](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/518) **`linedelimiters` no longer exists** on patch objects; instead, when a patch with Windows-style CRLF line endings is parsed, **the lines in `lines` will end with `\\r`**. There is now a **new `autoConvertLineEndings` option, on by default**, which makes it so that when a patch with Windows-style line endings is applied to a source file with Unix style line endings, the patch gets autoconverted to use Unix-style line endings, and when a patch with Unix-style line endings is applied to a source file with Windows-style line endings, it gets autoconverted to use Windows-style line endings.\n\n-   [#&#8203;521](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/521) \\*\\*the `callback` option is now supported by `structuredPatch`, \\`createPatch\n\n-   [#&#8203;529](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/529) **`parsePatch` can now parse patches where lines starting with `--` or `++` are deleted/inserted**; previously, there were edge cases where the parser would choke on valid patches or give wrong results.\n\n-   [#&#8203;530](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/530) **Added `ignoreNewlineAtEof` option`to`diffLines\\`**\n\n-   [#&#8203;533](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/533) **`applyPatch` uses an entirely new algorithm for fuzzy matching.** Differences between the old and new algorithm are as follows:\n    -   The `fuzzFactor` now indicates the maximum [*Levenshtein* distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) that there can be between the context shown in a hunk and the actual file content at a location where we try to apply the hunk. (Previously, it represented a maximum [*Hamming* distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance), meaning that a single insertion or deletion in the source file could stop a hunk from applying even with a high `fuzzFactor`.)\n    -   A hunk containing a deletion can now only be applied in a context where the line to be deleted actually appears verbatim. (Previously, as long as enough context lines in the hunk matched, `applyPatch` would apply the hunk anyway and delete a completely different line.)\n    -   The context line immediately before and immediately after an insertion must match exactly between the hunk and the file for a hunk to apply. (Previously this was not required.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;535](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/535) **A bug in patch generation functions is now fixed** that would sometimes previously cause `\\ No newline at end of file` to appear in the wrong place in the generated patch, resulting in the patch being invalid.\n\n-   [#&#8203;535](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/535) **Passing `newlineIsToken: true` to *patch*-generation functions is no longer allowed.** (Passing it to `diffLines` is still supported - it's only functions like `createPatch` where passing `newlineIsToken` is now an error.) Allowing it to be passed never really made sense, since in cases where the option had any effect on the output at all, the effect tended to be causing a garbled patch to be created that couldn't actually be applied to the source file.\n\n-   [#&#8203;539](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/539) **`diffWords` now takes an optional `intlSegmenter` option** which should be an `Intl.Segmenter` with word-level granularity. This provides better tokenization of text into words than the default behaviour, even for English but especially for some other languages for which the default behaviour is poor.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Why? It shoulda been initialized in the parent component - app-table.

The legacy JS API is itself\n    deprecated, and you should move off of it if possible, but this will allow\n    users of bundlers and other tools that are still using the legacy API to\n    still control deprecation warnings.\n\n-   Fix a bug where accessing `SourceSpan.url` would crash when a relative URL was\n    passed to the Sass API.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Explicitly expose a `sass` executable from the `sass-embedded` npm package.\n    This was intended to be included in 1.63.0, but due to the way\n    platform-specific dependency executables are installed it did not work as\n    intended. Now users can run `npx sass` for local installs or just `sass` when\n    `sass-embedded` is installed globally.\n\n-   Add linux-riscv64, linux-musl-riscv64, and android-riscv64 support for the\n    `sass-embedded` npm package.\n\n-   Fix an edge case where the Dart VM could hang when shutting down when requests\n    were in flight.\n\n-   Fix a race condition where the embedded host could fail to shut down if it was\n    closed around the same time a new compilation was started.\n\n-   Fix a bug where parse-time deprecation warnings could not be controlled by\n    the deprecation options in

This configuration can lead to incorrect content being served, particularly in scenarios involving lazy-loaded modules or Angular routes with dots in their paths.\r\n\r\n### Current Problem:\r\n**1. Static File and SSR Route Handling:**\r\n\r\n* The server uses server.get('**', express.static(...)) and server.get('**', ...) for static files and SSR routes, respectively. This configuration causes every request to go through the static file middleware, including those intended for Angular SSR.\r\n* As a result, some routes can inadvertently serve the `index.html` file or other static assets, leading to incorrect `Content-Type` headers, especially for JavaScript files (e.g., lazy-loaded modules; the `main*.js` and `chunk*.js` files).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0f9744-2440-4f9f-986e-4e3f4b9afa6f)\r\n(I cant show the response, but it's the `index.html` content)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076e746-28cb-489f-ad5e-5e55291668ce)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Lack of Distinction Between Static Files and Angular Routes:**\r\n\r\nRequests that are intended to be handled by Angular’s SSR engine may be incorrectly intercepted by the static file middleware if the requested path contains dots or other file-like patterns. This can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect content delivery.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution:\r\n**1. Static Files Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '**',\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: 'index.html',\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '*.*', // This ensures only files with extensions are served by express.static\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: false, // Do not look for index.html in the browserDistFolder\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.

but that option is not marked as selected.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/qdwgu9?file=package.json (an unmodified fork of the 'Require an autocomplete option to be selected' demo of autocomplete as on https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/examples)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete and select 'One'\r\n2. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65d9ab91-0695-4be0-af55-1eae5eb65060)\r\n3. Delete out the 'n' & the 'e' to be left with a filter of 'O'; note that the 'myControl.value' is still `One` (due to having set `requireSelection`)\r\n4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c45088e-c38b-401a-ad4e-8d731fa00b20)\r\n5. Delete out the final 'O' from your filter; note that 'myControl.value' is again still `One`\r\n6. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\r\n7. In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2505485383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T14:08:36","Actor":"GiftLanga","Number":"29690","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …","State":"open","Body":"…input\r\n\r\nAdds the `updateNativeInput` field to the autocomplete trigger to update the native input element when the autocomplete is within a form field.\r\n\r\nFixes #29388.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …\" (#29690)"},{"Id":"2504966843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T10:42:16","Actor":"MaiGhoneim","Number":"29689","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n8.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nwhen enabling drag and drop in angular material table from columns headers for reoreder columns, cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" do not working in angular 18 \r\ni attached my code in the following link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. trying to drag any column header\r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nwhen dragging column header should be drag and drop only horizontail and in x direction\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ncolumn header drag and drop to everywhere\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table\" (#29689)"},{"Id":"2504834134","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T09:47:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29688","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): drop sanity checks","State":"open","Body":"Removes the sanity checks since they won't execute with standalone by default, they mostly aren't necessary now that we're loading structural styles automatically and they produce some concrete styles that are problematic for the new theming APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29688","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): drop sanity checks\" (#29688)"},{"Id":"2504621459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T08:14:12","Actor":"iFederx","Number":"29687","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): mat tab content not visible if tab is switched during animation of parent div","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you have a div animated that contains a mat-tab-group and you change tab during parent div's animation, the tab content will be invisible.\r\nLast version tested: angular 16.2.1.

Hence hiding the focussed element from assistive technology and throwing this error. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, macOS\r\n![Uploading Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 12.55.54 PM.png…]()\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29682","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Dialog launched from a menu\" (#29682)"},{"Id":"2498693428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T15:07:01","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29674","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): remove old IE workaround","State":"closed","Body":"Removes a workaround for an IE bug that is no longer necessary.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29674","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tooltip): remove old IE workaround\" (#29674)"},{"Id":"2500419964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T15:06:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29678","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/a11y): use native media query for high contrast detection","State":"closed","Body":"Changes the `cdk.high-contrast` mixin to use a native media query instead of a custom CSS classes.

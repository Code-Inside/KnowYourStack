Some of them are optional but the input `config` is required to use the component. Therefore I defined a component selector that has an element part and an attribute part (e.g. `app-my-component[config]`). Now I always need to pass a config into the component if I want to use it. Great! I started the app with `ng serve` and everything works fine. So far so good...\r\n\r\nWhile writing the component tests I'm coming in trouble. I set the config in the `beforeEach` block where the component fixture is also created. However the required input attribute `config` is always an empty string when I called `fixture.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\nHere is the Test-File of the [minimal Reproduction](https://github.com/riede/component-with-element-and-attribute-selector) I wrote that shows exactly the behaviour.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndescribe('TestComponent', () => {\r\n  let component: TestComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<TestComponent>;\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(async(() => {\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ TestComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n    .compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(TestComponent);\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    component.requiredInput = { anyKey: 'anyValue'};\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should create', () => {\r\n    expect(component).toBeTruthy();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should not fail', () => {\r\n    const expectedResult: RequiredInput = { anyKey: 'anyValue' };\r\n    expect(component.requiredInput).toEqual(expectedResult); // <-- this expectation fails\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving the attribute part of the selector solves the problem.

This work enabled a more\r\nincremental flow for template type-checking, but unintentionally introduced\r\nseveral regressions in performance, caused by poor incrementality during\r\n`ts.Program` creation.\r\n\r\n1. The `TypeCheckProgramHost` was made to rely on the `ts.CompilerHost` to\r\n   retrieve instances of `ts.SourceFile`s from the original program. If the\r\n   host does not return the original instance of such files, but instead\r\n   creates new instances, this has two negative effects: it incurs\r\n   additional parsing time, and it interferes with TypeScript's ability to\r\n   reuse information about such files.\r\n\r\n2. During the incremental creation of a `ts.Program`, TypeScript compares\r\n   the `referencedFiles` of `ts.SourceFile` instances from the old program\r\n   with those in the new program. If these arrays differ, TypeScript cannot\r\n   fully reuse the old program. The implementation of reference tagging\r\n   introduced in 4213e8d5 restores the original `referencedFiles` array\r\n   after a `ts.Program` is created, which means that future incremental\r\n   operations involving that program will always fail this comparison,\r\n   effectively limiting the incrementality TypeScript can achieve.\r\n\r\nProblem 1 exacerbates problem 2: if a new `ts.SourceFile` is created by the\r\nhost after shim generation has been disabled, it will have an untagged\r\n`referencedFiles` array even if the original file's `referencedFiles` was\r\nnot restored, triggering problem 2 when creating the template type-checking\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nTo fix these issues, `referencedFiles` arrays are no longer cleaned up.\r\nThis is safe to do (it's how View Engine worked) but it now requires\r\n`referencedFiles` to be temporarily cleaned during emit, so as not to\r\nproduce triple-slash references directives in .d.ts files (this temporary\r\ncleanup is also something that View Engine did).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `TypeCheckProgramHost` now uses the original `ts.Program`\r\nto retrieve original instances of `ts.SourceFile`s where possible,\r\npreventing issues when a host would otherwise return fresh instances.\r\n\r\nTogether, these fixes ensure that program reuse is as incremental as\r\npossible, and tests have been added to verify this for certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nAn optimization was further added to prevent the creation of a type-checking\r\n`ts.Program` in the first place if no type-checking is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the `NgTscPlugin`, there is no current API hook that notifies\r\nthe plugin of the impending emit operation. Instead, shims are removed\r\nduring the emit operation, by a transformer that the plugin inserts. In the\r\nfuture an API hook can be introduced which tsc_wrapped calls prior to emit,\r\nallowing for a cleaner integration.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37641","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(compiler-cli): fix regression in type-checking program reuse\" (#37641)"},{"Id":"641508086","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T23:05:49","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"37639","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(ngcc): shortcircuit tokenizing in ESM dependency host","State":"closed","Body":"This dependency host tokenizes files to identify all the imported\r\npaths.

To enable CSP, configure your web server to return an appropriate Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. Read more about content security policy at [An Introduction to Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) on the HTML5Rocks website.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nWe should clearly state some of the known limitations and configurations for using Angular with a CSP.\r\n\r\nHere are some related, known issues that have been around for 1-4 years now\r\n- [Inline <style> elements violate style-src Content Security Policy](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6361)\r\n- [[innerHTML] triggers CSP alert/report](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25214)\r\n- [Empty style tag generated when one or more components don't have styles](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31191)\r\n- [feat: add a customizable nonce attribute for injected style elements](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26152)\r\n\r\n## Suggested Steps\r\n\r\n1. We should clearly state that allowing `'unsafe-inline'` in `style-src` is required for Angular applications.\r\n1. We should clearly state that `'self'` is required for `style-src` and `script-src` in Angular applications.\r\n1. We should recommend `upgrade-insecure-requests`.\r\n1. We should document that `connect-src` must be configured with `'self'` and any other font, script, or style sources that are retrieved by `@angular/service-worker`.\r\n\r\nIf there are some little-known work arounds for any of these issues, they should be documented in this guide.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\nChrome 85\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n[WebPageTest.org](https://webpagetest.org/) now gives web sites/apps a security grade based on a scan by [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy gets the following score\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 12 28 10 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/84978392-c6181100-b0fa-11ea-9182-74de8ed6bd48.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 12 29 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/84978402-cadcc500-b0fa-11ea-9fb0-6f6e39a16eba.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37631","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(security): add useful guidance to the CSP section of the guide\" (#37631)"},{"Id":"640813083","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T00:01:15","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"37629","RawContent":null,"Title":"Flaky `test_aio` and `test_aio_local` CircleCI jobs","State":"open","Body":"The `test_aio` and `test_aio_local` CircleCI jobs started to be quite flaky recently (~50% of attempts results in false-positive failures).

The big trouble for anyone trying to use Angular and GraphQL is that there is no way of pre-compile GraphQL documents. This way we end up with an extremely oversized bundles and increased script initialization.\r\n\r\nThere are solutions out there that compile GraphQL document into an AST:\r\n- [`graphql-tag/loader`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#webpack-loading-and-preprocessing)\r\n- [`babel-plugin-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`ts-transform-graphql-tag`](https://github.com/firede/ts-transform-graphql-tag)\r\n- [`rollup-plugin-graphql`](https://github.com/Kocal/rollup-plugin-graphql)\r\n\r\nNone of the solutions listed above can be used effectively if we intend to develop library containing GraphQL.\r\nWith application alone we could theoretically make it work with `graphql-tag/loader`. Adding library into the mix will simply not work, as `ng-packagr` is completely closed to any custom Rollup loaders.\r\n\r\nSimilar `ng-packagr` issue: https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1619\r\n\r\nDisclamer: I know the main issue is in `ng-packagr`, but I wanted to see what is the overall Angular CLI take on this, since Angular CLI is \"blocked\" by it indirectly.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIf the GraphQL is big enough in Angular it could become first class citizen.\r\nIf not (probably not), we would need some convenient way of adding loaders for both applications **and** libraries, as covering applications alone is only half of the story.\r\n\r\nI know `ng-packagr` is a complete separate project, but that is exactly the problem here.

So what's happening is that the five or so <script/> tags are injecting on the first line of the file, but because that's an illegal region for html content here, the twig rendering is breaking (it has to happen between {%content%} block tags in the doc). I'm sure I can write an auxiliary task or something to find and move that snippet or just import my angular \"index\" file as a partial into a parent template.

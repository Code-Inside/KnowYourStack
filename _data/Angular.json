The problem is with the `InputMap` type inside `ɵɵDirectiveDeclaration` type declaration. In Angular 15 versions, this `InputMap` value type is string`{[key: string]: string}` while in Angular 16 versions it can be string or objects like so `{[key: string]: string|{alias: string|null, required: boolean}}`. Now the issue is, it throws compile time error because the data returned as `InputMap` during compilation is mismatched with the expected type of string, because an object is being returned instead of string and Angular 15 versions expect string type for `InputMap` map value. As I see it, the issue can be solved either by changing the `InputMap` type to accept objects like the Angular 16 versions or changing the returned type to comply with `{[key: string]: string}` type for Angular 15 versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MurhafSousli/ngx-gallery/issues/563\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nnode_modules/ng-gallery/lightbox/lightbox.directive.d.ts:16:84 - error TS2344: Type '{ index: { alias: \"lightbox\"; required: false; }; id: { alias: \"gallery\"; required: false; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint '{ [key: string]: string; }'.\r\nProperty '\"index\"' is incompatible with index signature.\r\nType '{ alias: \"lightbox\"; required: false; }' is not assignable to type 'string'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNode: v18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.0\r\nOS: window x64\r\nAngular/common: \"^15.0.0\",\r\nAangular/cli: \"~15.0.2\",\r\nAngular/core: \"^15.0.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nNow I should note, I was able to solve this issue by tampering with the compiled index.d.ts file. All I had to do was change the `InputMap` type to accept types of {} as well as string. Eg:\r\n\r\n`InputMap extends {\r\n    [key: string]: string;\r\n}\r\n` to `InputMap extends {\r\n    [key: string]: string | {};\r\n}\r\n` inside `ɵɵDirectiveDeclaration` type. \r\n\r\nLike I said, Angular 16 doesn't have this issues because InputMap type extended with `[key: string]: string | {}`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50965","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue

https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0\n\n##### 🚀 Improvements\n\n**Method aliases**\n\nNew methods (`glob`, `globSync`, `globStream`) have been added in addition to the current methods (default import, `sync`, `stream`), which eliminate the need to rename the method when importing. In addition, an `async` alias has been added for the default import, which makes it possible to use this packet with ESM.\n\n**Method to convert paths to globs**\n\nA new method (`convertPathToPattern`) has been added in this release to convert a path to a pattern. The primary goal is to enable users to avoid processing Windows paths in each location where this package is used by utilities from third-party packages.\n\nSee more details in the [pull request](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/392).\n\n##### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   In the past, we mishandled patterns that contained slashes when the `baseNameMatch` option was enabled, which went against the documented behavior. ([#&#8203;312](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/312))\n-   Several problems with matching patterns that contain brace expansion have been resolved.  The primary issue solved is when the pattern has duplicate slashes after it is expanded ([#&#8203;394](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/394)), or the `micromatch` package does not correctly generate a regular expression ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/365)).\n-   All negative patterns will now have the `dot` option enabled when matching paths. Previously, the `!**/*` patterns did not exclude hidden files (start with a dot). ([#&#8203;343](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/343))\n-   The issue that led to duplicates in the results when overlapping or duplicate patterns were present among the patterns has been fixed. At the moment, we are only talking about leading dot. Other cases are not included. For example, running with the patterns `['./file.md', 'file.md', '*']` will now only include `file.md` once in the results. ([#&#8203;190](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/190))\n\n##### 📖 Documentation\n\nA [clarifying note](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/blob/master/README.md#concurrency) has been added for the `concurrency` option, which provides more detailed information about the Thread Pool utilization.\n\n##### ⚙️ Infrastructure\n\n-   The benchmark in CI is now running on Node.js 20.\n-   The benchmark now uses the public package [bencho](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/bencho) instead of an in-house implementation. You may want to try this solution for your packages and provide feedback.\n\n##### 🥇 New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;josh-hemphill](https://togithub.com/josh-hemphill) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383)\n-   [@&#8203;mairaw](https://togithub.com/mairaw) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.30.1`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0301-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0300v0301-2023-07-04)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.30.0...v0.30.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   expose .d.ts as cjs version ([#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/253)) ([262e113](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/262e113ee25e9c7d317282b3015102ec932ae2f5))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v20.8.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.8.0): puppeteer-core: v20.8.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.7.4...puppeteer-core-v20.8.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **screenshot:** enable optimizeForSpeed ([#&#8203;10492](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10492)) ([87aaed4](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/87aaed4807e5240dec7b25273e44c1ce5e884336))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add an internal page.locatorRace ([#&#8203;10512](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10512)) ([56a97dd](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/56a97dd2fb1cbf36e4f3344f7d22afd6e7ef2380))\n\n### [`v20.7.4`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.7.4): puppeteer-core: v20.7.4\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.7.3...puppeteer-core-v20.7.4)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   fix escaping algo for P selectors ([#&#8203;10474](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10474)) ([84a956f](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/84a956f56ba9ce74e9dd0f95ff40fdd14be87b1d))\n-   fix the util import in Connection.ts ([#&#8203;10450](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10450)) ([61f4525](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/61f4525ae306810404af9083d2e7440403c02722))\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   The following workspace dependencies were updated\n    -   dependencies\n        -   [@&#8203;puppeteer/browsers](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/browsers) bumped from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

These customers seem to be using older browsers, with most of them reporting issues on their smart TVs, some of which haven't been updated in a while. We're fairly confident that updating their browsers or switching from the TV's current browser to a more popular one such as Chrome or Firefox would probably resolve the issue, but we would like to reduce the effort on their end where possible, especially since some of them are not sure how to go about updating their TVs and others say they are unable to.\r\n\r\nWe were able to replicate the issue locally by installing and running our software in an old version of Chromium from 2019 (Version 75.0.3770.0), and our investigation found that it was failing because of some code in `node_modules\\zone.js\\fesm2015\\zone.js`. More specifically, the line `let C = this.constructor?.[Symbol.species];` was throwing up an error stating `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .` was the issue.\r\n\r\nWe were able to get around this locally by changing lines 1432 and 1451 from this:\r\n```\r\nlet C = this.constructor?.[Symbol.species];\r\n```\r\nto this:\r\n```\r\nlet myConstructor = this.constructor;\r\nlet C;\r\nif(myConstructor)\r\n{\r\n\tC = this.constructor[Symbol.species];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this allowed it to compile on our end, none of us are particularly knowledgeable about zone.js, and we're hesitant to make changes to external code which may have a knock-on effect throughout our application. As I understand it, zone.js 0.11.1 introduced a number of breaking changes for old browsers, but is this issue an expected one? We would ideally like to support older browsers where possible and know whether this is likely to be problematic before we make a decision on whether to proceed with it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's a relevant factor, but our application is hosted in Azure.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.1.3\r\nNode: 18.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.3\r\n@angular/http                   7.2.16\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50949","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"zone.js causes issues when using older browsers\" (#50949)"},{"Id":"1789821518","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-05T15:57:27","Actor":"Isarhamster","Number":"50951","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing images in the sample Housing application","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe jpg images in the sample Housing application are missing.

I pass these URLs around as strings because that's a simple and clean way to do it. Now, I want pass these URLs to `routerLink`. Sometimes standalone, sometimes I want to add navigation commands (to navigate to a sub-route).\r\n\r\nI initially thought I could pass the URL as first command because it supports slash-separated segments. However, this breaks as soon as the URL contains encoded characters like `%2F` (encoded forward slash). The percent sign will end up double-encoded (`%252f`).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the corresponding code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5d11844a7c31df56d2b97e3aa6cd1a70b5fccc70/packages/router/src/create_url_tree.ts#L231-L245\r\n\r\n`cmd` is split on `/`, but the resulting `urlPart` instances are not further decoded. When the resulting `UrlTree` is later serialized, the parts will be encoded again, resulting in the double encoding.\r\n\r\nIt's probably not possible to change the behavior of `createUrlTree` or `routerLink` because that would be breaking and in some cases also not what is expected. Therefore, I propose a new feature to support this.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nCommands can already be more than just strings: It is possible to pass `{ segmentPath: 'some/thing' }` instead of a string. This allows to bypass the slash-splitting logic in the first command.\r\n\r\nWe could something similar for passing in an URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRouter.createUrlTree([\r\n    { url: 'first-segment/second%2fsegment' },\r\n    'third-segment'\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of `url` would be expected to be a properly serialized URL. Otherwise, the call would error.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nApps can deserialize the URLs themselves, and then pass the path segments into `routerLink`, Then, no new Angular feature would be needed. However, it might be good to mention this case in the documentation of `Router.createNaivgationTree` because other developers might fall into the same trap as me, thinking that the first command is a URL while it in fact is not.\r\n\r\nHere is the implementation of a pipe apps can use to work around the problem:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Takes an encoded URL and parses it so it can be passed to Router.createUrlTree\r\n *\r\n * This can be used to pass an encoded URL to e.g. [routerLink]\r\n *\r\n * All arguments are treated as additional path segments.\r\n */\r\n@Pipe({\r\n    name: 'decodeRouterUrl',\r\n    standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class DecodeRouterUrlPipe implements PipeTransform {\r\n    transform(url: string, ...args: string[]): ReadonlyArray<string> {\r\n        const isAbsolute = url.startsWith('/');\r\n        if (isAbsolute) {\r\n            url = url.substring(1);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        const urlParts = url.split('/').map((p) => decodeURIComponent(p));\r\n\r\n        // The first navigation command will be split on slashes, which is not what we want here\r\n        // so we always supply either '/' or '.' as first command\r\n        return [isAbsolute ?

The only possible hunch would be the iban commonjs module?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThe only things I have changed  were in the configuration: adding the `-esbuild` suffix to the specified

regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am trying to extend an abstract class on `:host` selector and it works well until my abstract class has some nested selector styles.\r\nImagine this:\r\n```scss\r\n%test-hover {\r\n  color: green;\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    color: gray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n:host {\r\n  @extend %test-hover;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt generates this:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100] {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut should generate this:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100] {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100]:hover {\r\n  color: gray;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever it works fine when the nested selector does not have `&`.\r\n```scss\r\n%test-hover {\r\n  color: green;\r\n  :hover {\r\n    color: gray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n:host {\r\n  @extend %test-hover;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nProduces this:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-gmj-c100] {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n[_nghost-gmj-c100]   [_ngcontent-gmj-c100]:hover {\r\n  color:

This makes it difficult for users who prefer to use a screen reader to identify icons on a page.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n0. On a Chromebook, open Chrome and enable ChromeVox\r\n1. Navigate to the demos at https://material.angular.io/components/icon/examples\r\n2. Use tab and search+arrow keys to navigate to the Basic Icon and the SVG Icon on the page\r\n3. Observe that CVox reads \"home\" for the basic icon rather than its aria-label, and ignores the SVG icon completely\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe aria-label on each icon should be included in the document flow. Instead of \"home\", I expect ChromeVox to read out the full aria label of the icon (which is \"Example home icon\"). It should also do the same for the SVG icon on the same page (which is \"Example thumbs up SVG icon\").\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIcon labels are left out of the document flow, and it's left to the user to use Search+G to get any information about them. However, the \"home\" text from the basic icon is read out in the basic document flow (this is not its aria label). \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome v102.0.5005.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ChromeOS v102.0.5005.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatIcon): Aria label on material icons is ignored by ChromeVox screen reader\" (#25147)"},{"Id":"1279274861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-23T15:17:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"25133","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/schematics): v15 migrate import declarations","State":"closed","Body":"* implement import declaration migrations for\r\n      v15 legacy components ng-update","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25133","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/schematics): v15 migrate import declarations\" (#25133)"},{"Id":"1282314994","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-23T14:07:26","Actor":"iKrishnaSahu","Number":"25142","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(stackblitz): Stackblitz is down","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nStackblitz is down.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34937515/175296948-dd31cac9-0564-41f5-9608-5fad470eb660.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

It doesn't happen every time, but often enough. There's no noticeable pattern / precondition.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen **opening** the dialog the content appears blank for ~5 seconds. Actually the component is rendered but only partially, e.g. the `mat-form-field` and the `input` is there, but not the `mat-label`. Same with some attributes and other parts like `mat-dialog-title`, which is there but has no content yet. The content is just a simple text from a pure pipe.\r\nI've checked this by quickly getting the `outerHTML` of the `overlay-container` during and after the blank phase.\r\n\r\nThen after those ~5 seconds everything is displayed and working.\r\nYou can also see that the blank dialog starts the close animation before the proper dialog is shown. But in both cases they have the same overlay id.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen hitting the **close** button the dialog takes a few seconds before closing. You can keep clicking the close button and the ripple effect will appear, so the browser is not freezing because of some heavy computation.

Inside the parent component I have a child component that takes the array from the parent as input. So, in this case, cdkVirtualFor is in the child component. I also have ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush on both the parent and child components. However, the view is empty (not updated) unless I remove ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPushon the child component or unless I use ngFor instead of cdkVirtualFor.,\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ad81nf?file=src%2Fapp%2Fchild-component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-overview-example.html\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected the view to be updated when the child's input changes even with ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe view does not update even when the child component receives the input from the parent.\n\n### Environment\n\nSee stackblitz for dependencies\r\nChrome Version 102.0.5005.115","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25125","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkVirtualFor does not update the view when ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush on child component\" (#25125)"},{"Id":"1278252000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T10:41:14","Actor":"tomjosephp","Number":"25124","RawContent":null,"Title":"auto-suggestion is not showing in the material chip after being selected from the suggestion drop-down list","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe \"Chip\" field is showing the drop-down list by default only for adding the first-time chip.

While this is great for certain use cases, many RxJS use cases require us to consume the control state reactively.\r\n\r\nWhile working with NgRx, RxJS and Angular, we often still need \"regular\" observables, which automatically replay the latest state, whenever you subscribe to them. Additionally a lot of developers are searching for ways to bind to variables like `dirty`,  `invalid` reactively.\r\n\r\nWe were previously using the [`ngneat/reactive-forms`](https://github.com/ngneat/reactive-forms) which offered a great developer experience, by providing these additional observables to ease our lives.\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy to **contribute a solution** that simply operates on top of the existing `valueChanges` and `statusChanges` to make the API of the `AbstractControl` more accessible.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAddition of cold observables, which replay the latest value, whenever they are subscribed to:\r\n- `value$` Similar to `valueChanges` but emits on subscription the latest value.\r\n- `dirty$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `pristine$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `touched$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `untouched$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `enabled$`: Mirrors the enabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `disabled$`: Mirrors the disabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `valid$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `invalid$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEvery dev can write their own set of helper functions to reactively select attributes from the `AbstractControl`:\r\n\r\n[Example App](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mwxdxl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Findex.html)\r\n```ts\r\nexport function selectFormValue<Value, RawValue extends Value>(\r\n  control: AbstractControl<Value, RawValue>\r\n): Observable<Value> {\r\n  return defer(() => control.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(control.value)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Additional Observables for `AbstractControl`: `value$`, `dirty$`, `invalid$`, ...\" (#47289)"},{"Id":"1353864524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T07:55:25","Actor":"kbrilla","Number":"47287","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginal issue: #27936\r\n\r\nWhen there are 2 routes: child and parent, each has a resolved property, the data form the parent resolve is not available in child resolver (still available in ChildComponent though as expected)\r\n\r\n[Original Angular v6 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-7xwxls?file=src%2Findex.html)\r\n[Actual Angualr v14 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-4hynrm?file=src/app/app.module.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n`data` parameter of `route` should follow `paramsInheritanceStrategy`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe resolve data from the parent can still be accessed as\r\n```\r\nclass ChildResolver {\r\n  resolve(route) {\r\n    const parentData = route.parent.data;\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nbut this looks like a hack","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver \" (#47287)"},{"Id":"1353578272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T02:00:29","Actor":"kormide","Number":"47286","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(bazel): Fix a bug where the aio build artifact didn't include assets","State":"open","Body":"@devversion @josephperrott @gregmagolan \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

When both are provided (using two separate `[ngClass]` inputs - one with strings, the other with literal) - only one is rendered. In order to mix the incoming values, dev has to use some sort of ts helper that produces the literal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI would propose that Angular adopt a new array-based syntax for `[ngClass]`. The [`NgClassSupportedTypes`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_class.ts#L10) union would be extended by:\r\n\r\n`Array<string | Record<string, boolean | undefined | null>>`\r\n\r\nIn practice, dev would be able to provide an array of strings mixed with literals, depending on how a given css class is provided. Usage example:\r\n\r\n`[ngClass]=\"['fixed-class', input1, input2, {'flagged1': bool1, 'flagged2': bool2}, input3$ | async]\"`\r\n\r\nI think this syntax would reduce the code that today has to be handled by the TypeScript code (via getters, methods, HostBindings and whatnot), or get scattered over html and ts, thus making the code verbose and hardly manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, yes, certainly, workarounds exist, but they essentially produce overcomplicated and hardly maintainable code. The proposed syntax would consolidate css classes into one expression and move it close to the html element.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47279","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended ngClass array syntax (allow strings and literals)\" (#47279)"},{"Id":"1351905102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-26T16:46:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"47270","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 4.8 final","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps up to the final version of TS 4.8 and removes some workarounds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to TypeScript 4.8 final\" (#47270)"},{"Id":"1351911410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-26T16:44:34","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"47271","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): replace most usages of getMutableClone (#47167)","State":"closed","Body":"This is a cherry-pick of #47167 into the patch branch.\r\n\r\nReplaces (almost) all of the usages of the deprecated `getMutableClone` function from TypeScript which has started to log deprecation warnings in version 4.8 and will likely be removed in version 5.0.

This behavior could cause memory leaks in an app.\r\n\r\nFor example in [`withTypeAhead`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L142) method, there is a call of `this._typeaheadSubscription.unsubscribe();`, but it works only for the previous subscription when call this method couple of times:\r\n- some component calls for the first time `withTypeAhead()`, a subscription is created\r\n- when it calls it for the second time, the subscription from the previous step is unsubscribed, and subscribed one more time\r\n- after the component is destroyed, the last subscription will still be in the memory\r\n\r\nAlso, the same subscription issue is in the constructor\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L68\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This seems to happen if:\n\n1. While the resource is loading, the request changes\n2. Before the `effect()` can run, the `Promise` for the previous load resolves, which sets the resource out of loading state.\n3. The `effect` runs for the new request, but the resource is no longer a valid loading state per [this check](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9723f034c3c2ccd71cf0c53d6226d120ce652ae8/packages/core/src/resource/resource.ts#L287-L288).\n\nThe condition in (3) is really trying to guard that the resource hasn't been set into `Local` state after the request changed.

This occurred under a specific condition:\r\n\r\n1. The request changes while the resource is still in loading state\r\n2. The resource resolves the previous load before its `effect()` reacts to the request change.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the window for this race is small, because the request change in (1) will schedule the effect in (2) immediately. However, it's easier to trigger this sequencing in tests, especially when one resource depends on the output of another.\r\n\r\nTo fix the race condition, the resource impl is refactored to track the request in its state, and ignore resolved values or streams for stale requests.

In addition, the current behavior is counter-intuitive for HTML developers, that are expecting real isolation when shadow Dom is involved: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM#shadow_dom_and_custom_elements\r\n- This silently introduces a performance degradation when many instances of Angular components are composed in an application, mixing \"ShadowDom\" and other encapsulation types. The degradation is roughly of O(M*N) magnitude, where M and N are the component instance counts of None+Emulated type and ShadowDom type respectively.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #57801\r\nIssue Number: #35039 \r\nIssue Number: #5059 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe new behavior should reflect exactly the HTML spec about Shadow DOM: any component's private style must be injected as before, but no other component's style must be loaded inside the Shadow DOM.\r\nContrarily to the documentation, that states that the shared styles are injected to avoid \"unexpected styles\" when nested Angular component are used inside a Shadow-DOM ones, the developer must/can:\r\n\r\n- Use other Shadow-DOM based components with their own private encapsulated styles\r\n- Use `<slot>` to permit external style to be used when the component is a \"container\". \r\n\r\nHowever, the behavior cannot be changed without the dev's consensus.\r\n\r\nThe proposed PR exposes a global DI flag that the application can enabled (so app-wide) to enable the new behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever, a more granular approach should be used. Other possibilities, more user friendly, are:\r\n\r\n- A new enum flag of the `ViewEncapsulation` type (something like `IsolatedShadowDom`) that explicitly denies shared style injection;\r\n- A new Component annotation property;\r\n- A module-level config DI object.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59838","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Flag to adhere to standard HTML Shadow Dom style encapsulation\" (#59838)"},{"Id":"2826953054","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-03T09:35:47","Actor":"ADegele","Number":"59837","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng build fails after injecting Keycloak, but ng serve works fine","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler, compiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have recently upgraded to Angular 19 and the corresponding keycloak-angular module.

An error event can be received when defining a callback for `Worker.onerror` but this isn't of much help. The issue only occurs with external dependencies (even if the dependency is unused). In the minimal reproduction example I am using `comlink` but the same happens when importing something from `lodash`. Importing local scripts is working fine though.\nI have tried other major UI libraries like react, svelte and vue that have no problems with the any of the workers (despite the `optimizeDeps` issue with the vite bundler).\n\nProblematic code:\n```ts\nimport * as Comlink from 'comlink'; // even failing when not used further down\n\nconst obj = {\n    test() {\n        console.log(\"hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nonmessage = (message) => {\n    console.log(message.data, \"from worker with import\");\n}\n\nComlink.expose(obj);\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023b5238-7fbb-46f9-89bb-f9df50ac7a29)\n\nLoading the worker script had to be achieved by setting these settings in the `angular.json`:\n```json\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n        ...\n            \"assets\": [\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n

[https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994)\nI don't know if this would lead to the error condition I am experiencing.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created a repository for reproducing the problem: https://github.com/varfoer/comlink_worker_issues\nThe worker packages is already build there, so you can go ahead and try `npm

The backdrop (and overlay) stays open in this case and is only closeable via the Esc button. This breaks our automated e2e tests and could reasonably happen to a user.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-tgvat6zz?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click pretty fast repeatedly on the open button\n2. After a few clicks the click on the backdrop will not cause the overlay to close. You can still close it with Esc though.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe backdrop and overlay should close if I click on the backdrop and have the (backdropClick) set up to close it.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter a few clicks the backdrop and overlay stays open and does not react to clicks anymore.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.7\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.7\n@angular/build               19.0.7\n@angular/cdk                 19.1.2\n@angular/cli                 19.0.7\n@angular/material            19.1.2\n@schematics/angular          19.0.7\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): repeatedly opening and closing the overlay via (backdropClick) breaks responsiveness to clicks\" (#30426)"},{"Id":"2823410496","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-31T12:56:37","Actor":"roma2341","Number":"30425","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(button): I don't understand how to use most of design tokens","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFor example i see outlined-hover-state-layer-opacity, what is it, what values does it accept (opacity or color)? i tried to set it and it doesn't change anything.

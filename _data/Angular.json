When a transplanted view is inserted before its declaration, it gets refreshed in the retry loop of `detectChanges`. At this point, the `Dirty` flag has been cleared from all parents. Calling `markForCheck` marks the insertion tree up to the root `Dirty`. If the declaration is checked again as a result (i.e. because it has default change detection) and is reachable because its parent was marked `Dirty`, this can cause an infinite loop. The declaration is refreshed again, so the insertion is marked for refresh (again). We enter an infinite loop if the insertion tree always calls `markForCheck` for some reason (i.e. `{{createReplayObservable() | async}}`).\r\n\r\nWhile the case above does fall into an infinite loop, it also truly is a problem in the application. While it's not an infinite synchronous loop, the declaration and insertion are infinitely dirty and will be refreshed on every change detection round.\r\n\r\nUsually `markForCheck` does not have this problem because the `Dirty` flag is not cleared until the very end of change detection. However, if the view did not already have the `Dirty` flag set, it is never cleared because we never entered view refresh. One solution to this problem could be to clear the `Dirty` flag even after skipping view refresh but traversing to children.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54329","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): Fix possible infinite loop with `markForCheck` by partially reverting #54074\" (#54329)"},{"Id":"2124096236","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T23:41:31","Actor":"dolanmiu","Number":"54328","RawContent":null,"Title":"inject docs 404 bad link","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen clicking on \"Try out Inject\" in:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/roadmap#:~:text=in%20control%20flow-,Try%20out%20Inject,-New%20CDK%20directives\r\n\r\nit gives a \"Page Not Found 🙃\" message\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/roadmap\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI was looking for inject guides\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI would like the page to navigate to: https://angular.dev/guide/di\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54328","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"inject docs 404 bad link\" (#54328)"},{"Id":"2124089603","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T23:33:38","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"54327","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): work around internal test failure","State":"open","Body":"Fixes an internal test failure due to `FatalDiagnosticError` extending the native `Error`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54327","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): work around internal test failure\" (#54327)"},{"Id":"2124047298","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T23:03:06","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54326","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): show tooltip for hydration incon on directive forest","State":"open","Body":"The MatTooltip was missing after migrating to standalone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54326","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): show tooltip for hydration incon on directive forest\" (#54326)"},{"Id":"2123618271","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T22:22:08","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"54322","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): share refresh logic for cd and signal queries","State":"closed","Body":"Introducing a tiny utility method to remove some code duplication between the change change detection and signal based queries.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54322","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): share refresh logic for cd and signal queries\" (#54322)"},{"Id":"2123960755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T21:50:41","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"54325","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): catch function instance properties in interpolated signal diagnostic","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This map appears to be _global_ to each method per `window` (browser use case) / `global` instance and not per `Zone` as it's defined on `patchTimer`.\r\n\r\nTasks then use the return value from their schedule methods (such as `setTimeout`) to store this ID in `tasksByHandleId`. For example, in the case of a root zone with no wrapping it normally just calls\r\n`setNative` which may invoke `setTimeout` and we store the timer ID in the map. These IDs are monotonically increasing and therefore are never reused. However, in the case of [`fake-async-test`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/zone.js/lib/zone-spec/fake-async-test.ts#L69) it starts from `1` and increments it's own counters per task. \r\n\r\nIf you have a `Zone` that is using `setNative` and scheduling using the real browser scheduler and using `fake-async-zone` it is possible to generate two tasks that are both pending with the same ID because they don't know of each other. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet oldTimerId = \r\nrunInFakeAsyncZone(() => {\r\n  // Run a timer in such a way that it also returns the same timer ID\r\n  // but does not resolve, thus overwriting the taskMap\r\n  // Maybe it wasn't fired from an even and has to be flushed or something\r\n  oldTimerId = ...\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Run in <root>, running later\r\n// timerId == oldTimerId now\r\n// Therefore, `tasksByHandleId` is overwritten to use this ID\r\nlet timerId = setTimeout(() => console.log('I should run but never do'), 30000);\r\n\r\n\r\nrunInFakeAsyncZone(() => {\r\n  // We changed our mind, cancel the timer \r\n  clearInterval(oldTimerId)\r\n\r\n  // Actually, they shared an ID and `tasksByHandleId` was updated\r\n  // to point to the <root> task so `task.zone.cancelTask(task)` is invoked\r\n  // but the implementation uses `clearNative` and clears the <root> task\r\n  // meaning that the setTimeout never runs\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above psuedo-code, the task that runs in some other zone is overwritten with one that runs the `root` later because of the shared map. In contexts outside of `fake-async-test`, it's likely never going to happen\r\nbecause the IDs are strictly monotonically increasing. But in `fake-async-test`, this is troublesome because they can overlap which is bad news when using a single global `tasksByHandleId`\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. I don't know if this use case is that common but it's at least common in a couple of Google tests that trigger this behaviour\r\n2. If overlap is not expected, the task map should probably assert and break early because this was a _huge pain_ to track down as not only is timing sensitive but it's also a read / write race\r\n3. If overlap is expected in some cases, we need to somehow handle this\r\n\r\nI've not included a full reproduction yet because the exact specifics are kind of hard to encode but I will try and get something up.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nN/A; coming soon maybe\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular: HEAD\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54323","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FakeAsyncZone and RootZone used in conjunction can clobber interleaved timers of each other\" (#54323)"},{"Id":"2123170060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T18:56:07","Actor":"devversion","Number":"54314","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: verify signal-based queries in CLI integration test","State":"closed","Body":"Adds usages of signal-based queries into the signal integration test to verify queries\r\ncan be used in production, and testing environments as expected (i.e. the transform works as expected).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54314","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: verify signal-based queries in CLI integration test\" (#54314)"},{"Id":"2123583040","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T18:00:40","Actor":"Krizald18","Number":"54321","RawContent":null,"Title":"Command Reference Link redirect to 404","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nIn docs under \"The Angular CLI\", the link to \"Command Reference\" redirects to a 404 page.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tools/cli\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nThe Command Reference page\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nOnce clicked the link got me to a 404 page.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54321","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Command Reference Link redirect to 404\" (#54321)"},{"Id":"2123077256","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T17:43:02","Actor":"stanchev89","Number":"54310","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSR issue with page reload upon child routes","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nplatform-browser, platform-server\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm aware of this issue https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26323, but I believe my situation differs slightly. I'm currently facing challenges with investigating our upcoming potential Server-Side Rendering (SSR) migration. I'm struggling to identify the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario: We aim to trigger an API call from the server based on a query parameter, requiring us to provide the REQUEST from the server. Then, within the APP_INITIALIZER, we check the server environment and make the API call based on the query parameter. Everything functions correctly, but only for the '/' main route. When navigating to another path and reloading the page, we observe that the REQUEST is labeled as 'unknown'. Shouldn't the behavior be consistent, distributing the REQUEST and APP_INITIALIZER action independent of the current path?\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar observation is that I've logged 'APP_INITIALIZER -> SERVER' for each server iteration within the app initializer. Strangely, when the issue arises, this log isn't displayed. However, the handler is triggered, suggesting that the initializer is indeed executed.\r\n\r\nYou can find the repository with a prepared reproduction below:\r\n[](https://github.com/stanchev89/ng-ssr-issue)\r\n\r\n1.

However, the docs warns us that this only works if the same reference is used. This is kind of useless when we are building components that relies on the existence of a specific validator *type* (e.g. `maxLength`).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would definitely move the `hasValidator` and/or `getValidators` (which currently does not exist) to one level above, to the `NgControl`, since the `NgModel` collects its validators directly.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIn JS, a function can have extra properties, so the built-in `ValidatorFn` could be extended with a `type` and a `metadata` fields. This way, we could query if a validator type is present on the control or not. See alternative below.\r\n\r\nPossible API:\r\n```\r\nhasValidator(predicate: (validator: MarkedValidatorFn) => boolean): boolean;\r\nhasValidator(type: string): boolean;\r\nfindValidator(predicate: (validator: MarkedValidatorFn) => boolean): MarkedValidatorFn | null;\r\nfindValidator(type: string): MarkedValidatorFn | null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions would be useful to implement common form logic (e.g. x/y characters used, etc.).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can work around this by implementing it in our own, however it uses private API.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { type ValidatorFn, Validators as AngularValidators } from '@angular/forms';\r\n\r\nexport type MarkedValidatorFn = ValidatorFn & { type: string, metadata: unknown };\r\n\r\nexport class Validators {\r\n\r\n  static extendValidatorWithMetadata(validatorFn: ValidatorFn, type: string, metadata?: unknown): MarkedValidatorFn {\r\n    const fn = validatorFn as MarkedValidatorFn;\r\n    fn.type = type;\r\n    fn.metadata = metadata;\r\n    return fn;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static required = (): MarkedValidatorFn => this.extendValidatorWithMetadata(AngularValidators.required, 'required');\r\n\r\n  static maxLength = (max: number): MarkedValidatorFn => this.extendValidatorWithMetadata(AngularValidators.maxLength(max), 'maxLength', { max });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, adding it to a control like this:\r\n`textControl = new FormControl<string>('', [Validators.required(), Validators.maxLength(4)]);`\r\n\r\nFinally, we can query it:\r\n```\r\n@ContentChild(NgControl) private readonly control: NgControl | undefined;\r\n\r\nngAfterContentInit(): void {\r\n  if (this.control?.control) {\r\n    const control = this.control.control;\r\n\r\n    if (this.control instanceof NgModel) {\r\n      // we must use NG_VALIDATORS injectable, a common API would be nice\r\n    } else {\r\n      const validators = (control as AbstractControl & { _rawValidators: MarkedValidatorFn[] })._rawValidators;\r\n      const isRequired = validators.some(validator => validator.type === 'required');\r\n      const maxLengthValidator = validators.find(validator => validator.type === 'maxLength');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better `hasValidator` or `getValidators` support\" (#54305)"},{"Id":"2121992360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T07:47:14","Actor":"ccczy-czy","Number":"54301","RawContent":null,"Title":"can't access https://angular.dev/cli/commands","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\npage not found\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/commands\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54301","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"can't access https://angular.dev/cli/commands\" (#54301)"},{"Id":"2122344729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T07:18:15","Actor":"ascorbic","Number":"54303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Netlify Image CDN in NgOptimizedImage","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/image-cdn/overview/) is now automatically enabled for all sites deployed to Netlify and will be entering GA within the next two weeks.

This option allows global identifiers present in the code to be replaced with another value at build time. This is similar to the behavior of Webpack's `DefinePlugin` which was previously used with some custom Webpack configurations that used third-party builders. The option has similar capabilities to the `esbuild` option of the same name. The documentation for that option can be found here: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define \r\nThe command line capabilities of the Angular CLI option are not yet implemented and will added in a future change.\r\n\r\nThe option within the `angular.json` configuration file is of the form of an object. The keys of the object represent the global identifier to replace and the values of the object represent the corresponding replacement value for the identifier. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"define\": {\r\n    \"SOME_CONSTANT\": \"5\",\r\n    \"ANOTHER\": \"'this is a string literal'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll replacement values are defined as strings within the configuration file. If the replacement is intended to be an actual string literal, it should be enclosed in single quote marks. This allows the flexibility of using any valid JSON type as well as a different identifier as a replacement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, TypeScript needs to be aware of the module type for the import to prevent type-checking\r\nerrors during the build. This can be accomplished with an additional type definition file within the\r\napplication source code (`src/types.d.ts`, for example) with the following or similar content:\r\n```\r\ndeclare const SOME_CONSTANT: number;\r\ndeclare const ANOTHER: string;\r\n```\r\nThe default project configuration is already setup to use any type definition files present in the\r\nproject source directories. If the TypeScript configuration for the project has been altered, the\r\ntsconfig may need to be adjusted to reference this newly added type definition file.\r\n\r\nAn important caveat to the option is that it does not function when used with values contained within Angular metadata such as a Component or Directive decorator. This limitation was present with previous third-party builder usage as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27047","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add define build option to application builder\" (#27047)"},{"Id":"2122265322","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T17:34:12","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27048","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [chokidar](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar) | devDependencies | minor | [`3.5.3` -> `3.6.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/chokidar/3.5.3/3.6.0) |\n| [postcss](https://postcss.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss)) | dependencies | patch | [`8.4.34` -> `8.4.35`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/postcss/8.4.34/8.4.35) |\n| [postcss](https://postcss.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss)) | devDependencies | patch | [`8.4.34` -> `8.4.35`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/postcss/8.4.34/8.4.35) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | dependencies | patch | [`6.6.1` -> `6.6.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.6.1/6.6.2) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | devDependencies | patch | [`6.6.1` -> `6.6.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.6.1/6.6.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>paulmillr/chokidar (chokidar)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.6.0`](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/releases/tag/3.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/compare/3.5.3...3.6.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   fix readyCount logic by [@&#8203;JLHwung](https://togithub.com/JLHwung) in [https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1288](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1288)\n-   handle MustScanSubDirs by [@&#8203;MarcCelani-at](https://togithub.com/MarcCelani-at) in [https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1197](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1197)\n-   update fs.FSWatcher types to satisfy nodejs versions >= 16;

Performance & Core Web Vitals","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/core and @angular/cli\r\n\r\n### Problems :\r\n\r\n- Using custom fonts from **Google Fonts** can significantly impact FCP, LCP and initial load performance in Angular applications.\r\n\r\n- Downloading fonts from Google servers adds **extra HTTP requests** and **latency**, slowing down initial paint times.\r\n\r\n- The **font swapping** has the potential to cause layout shifts and so impact Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution :\r\n\r\n- Introduce a **built-in** **mechanism** in Angular to **automatically downloads fonts** specified by their Google Fonts names (or similar identifiers) during the build process and **self-host fonts** within the application, eliminating the need for external font services like Google Fonts.\r\n\r\n- Utilize **preconnect**, **preload**, and **size-adjust** for optimal performance and seamless font rendering.\r\n\r\n### Benefits :\r\n\r\n- **Improved Performance:** Reduces reliance on external requests, minimizes layout shifts (thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust) , and enables efficient caching.\r\n\r\n- **Improved FCP and LCP:** Optimized fonts and proactive loading strategies contribute to significantly faster loading times and smoother user experiences.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced SEO:** Better Core Web Vitals can lead to higher search engine ranking and increased website traffic.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes exposure to external vulnerabilities and provides more control over font sources.\r\n\r\n- **Developer Experience:** Built-in font optimization in Angular improves developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAnyone interested is welcome to comment on what the proposed syntax and feature set will be.\r\n\r\nInspired by next.js automatic font self-hosting library (

It seems now certain initialization methods are getting called before content children exist in some cases?\r\n\r\nPrior to this update it looks like `_cacheRowDefs()` was not called until `ngAfterContentChecked()` which meant all content children queries had values. In `17.1.10` however this call now has a chance to run in `_outletAssigned()`.\r\n\r\n`_outletAssigned()` checks for the existence of: \r\n- `this._rowOutlet`\r\n- `this._headerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._footerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._noDataRowOutlet`\r\n\r\nHowever, when `_cacheRowDefs()` is called here (as a result of `_render()` getting called), it uses these `ContentChild` queries:\r\n- `this._contentHeaderRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentFooterRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentRowDefs`\r\n\r\nHowever, these are all undefined still when run with `17.1.0` or higher at the moment (at least when run in our library's storybook). It seems they are maybe getting called too early because of `_outletAssigned()`? When run in `17.0.6` or any early version this was never the case because these methods only were called after `ngAfterContentChecked()`. The problem here is those empty values get passed to `_getOwnDefs()`, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprivate _getOwnDefs<I extends {_table?: any}>(items: QueryList<I>): I[] {\r\n  return items.filter(item => !item._table || item._table === this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this method assumes items exist, but they are actually undefined in this instance an error gets thrown and no tables can load.\r\n\r\nI assume because `_render()` looks like it still gets called in `ngAfterContentChecked()` everything would be fine as long as `_getOwnDefs()` and possibly other internal methods were updated to handle null/undefined scenarios.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI am unsure how to recreate this at the moment. I assume it only occurs on a more old-school non-standalone component example perhaps? I wanted to open this ticket as this will prevent us from allowing anyone to update to `17.1.0` or higher until we can get something figured out here.\r\n\r\nOur extension of the CDK table is purely for styling much like the MatTable and its directives. We do not alter any of this logic or override any lower CDK functions.\r\n\r\nI will work on recreating this in a stackblitz and update this ticket when/if I can.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTables load like normal.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')\r\n    at MtrTable._getOwnDefs

Following the provided link \"https://angular.io/errors/NG01203\", I came to a page that is inadequate to enable resolution of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe page indicates that a value accessor must be registered and provides a code snippet that is incomplete. The provided code snippet has the following problems:\r\n1) it provides no context as to where the code snippet is to be placed\r\n2) it includes a reference to something called \"MyInputField\" without indicating what the type of that object is.\r\n\r\nThe section \"Debugging the error\" includes the completely unhelpful statement:\r\n\"1. If you defined a custom form control, did you remember to provide a value accessor?\"\r\nThis is unhelpful because it is effectively a circular reference and should be replaced with some redirection on how to create a value accessor and in what context the value accessor is being created\r\n\r\nThe page makes no reference to whether this an issue with the \"Reactive Forms API\" or any upgrade scenario that might have caused it. Likewise, the update guide (https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=11.0-15.0) makes no statement that simple forms now need something additional.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.io/errors/NG01203\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nA complete example on how to fix the issue or a reference to the required functionality should be provided.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nI upgraded from Angular 11 to Angular 15.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nThe documentation should outline what is required in enough detail to resolve the issue.

However, it is quite common in projects that use [SAP Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus) libraries or other component libraries.\r\n\r\nSpartacus is providing logic and components for building storefront applications. In implementation projects, we usually customize its services and replace some of the components with our custom ones. Standard practice is to extend a component from Spartacus to inherit the logic and replace the template. This approach allows us to write less and get automatic upgrades when we upgrade the Spartacus package. However, the problem is that the template of the parent component ends up in the bundle even though it's not used at all. Often, this makes the bundle size quite big negatively affecting performance.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could also affect other projects.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt seems to be quite hard to determine whether the template will be actually used or not. The only case that comes to my mind is when the class is used only in the context of extension or implementation. In that case, the compiler could potentially remove the `@Component` directive from the parent class.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to be able to instruct a compiler not to compile templates for specified components. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAn alternative would be that the component library (e.g. Spartacus) splits the components into smart and dumb components. The dumb component would then have the `@Component` decorator and would extend from the smart component which would contain logic only.

Time to Interactive (TTI) no longer contributes to the performance score and is not displayed in the report. However, it is still accessible in the Lighthouse result JSON.\n\nWithout TTI, the weighting of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) has increased from 15% to 25%. See the docs for a complete breakdown of [how the Performance score is calculated in 10.0](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10), or [play with the scoring calculator](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/scorecalc/#FCP=3000\\&SI=5800\\&FMP=4000\\&TTI=7300\\&FCI=6500\\&LCP=4000\\&TBT=600\\&CLS=0.25\\&device=mobile\\&version=10\\&version=8).\n\n##### Types for the Node package\n\nLighthouse now includes type declarations! Our [example TypeScript recipe](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/main/docs/recipes/type-checking) demonstrates how to achieve proper type safety with Lighthouse.\n\n##### Third-party Entity classification\n\nSince Lighthouse 5.3, the community-driven [`third-party-web`](https://togithub.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) dataset has been used to summarize how every third-party found on a page contributes to the total JavaScript blocking time, via the `third-party-summary` audit. With Lighthouse 10.0, we are adding a new property to the JSON result (`entities`) to make further use of this dataset. Every origin encountered on a page is now classified as first-party or third-party within `entities`. In 10.0, this classification is used to power the existing third-party filter checkbox.\n\nIn a future version of Lighthouse, this will be used to group the table items of every audit based on the entity it originated from, and aggregate the impact of items from that specific entity.\n\n#### 🆕 New Audits\n\n##### Back/forward cache\n\nThe Back/forward cache (bfcache for short) is a browser optimization that serves pages from fully serialized snapshots when navigating back or forwards in session history. There are over 100 different reasons why a page may not be eligible for this optimization, so to assist developers Lighthouse now attempts to trigger a bfcache response and will list anything that prevented the browser from using the bfcache. [#&#8203;14465](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14465)\n\nFor more on bfcache, see [the web.dev article](https://web.dev/bfcache/).\n\nNote: This audit initially will not be available for PageSpeed Insights.\n\n##### Preventing pasting to inputs\n\nThe audit `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` is now `paste-preventing-inputs`. This audit's logic works just as before, but rather than just considering `[type=password]` inputs, it now fails if *any* non-readonly input element prevents the user from pasting. [#&#8203;14313](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14313)\n\n#### Lighthouse documentation is now on developer.chrome.com\n\nOur documentation is no longer hosted on web.dev. For the most up to date audit docs, please go to [developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)\n\n#### 💥 Breaking changes\n\nUnder the hood, Lighthouse now uses the new user-flow supporting infrastructure by default, even for traditional navigation runs. You can opt out of this by: in the CLI, use `--legacy-navigation`; in DevTools: check “Legacy Navigation” in the settings menu. If you have a use case that necessitates this escape hatch, please file an issue. We plan to remove this legacy path in 11.0.\n\n##### For Lighthouse result JSON (LHR) users\n\n##### Page URLs on the Lighthouse Result\n\nUntil now, there were two URL fields to describe a Lighthouse run:\n\n-   `requestedUrl`: the url given by the users, which Lighthouse instructs Chrome to navigate to\n-   `finalUrl`: the url after any server-initiated HTTP and JS-initiated redirects\n\nThis taxonomy cannot account for more complex scenarios, such as JS-initiated redirects, usage of the History API or soft-navigations. They were also ill-defined for timespan and snapshot modes. To account for that, Lighthouse 10.0 now has these URL fields:\n\n-   (changed) `requestedUrl`: The URL that Lighthouse initially navigated to before redirects. This is the same as it was before for navigation mode, but now it will be `undefined` in timespan/snapshot.\n-   (new) `mainDocumentUrl`: The URL of the last document requested during a navigation. It does not account for soft navigations or history API events made after the page loads. It is only available in navigation mode, and will be undefined in timespan and snapshot modes.\n-   (new) `finalDisplayedUrl`: The URL displayed in the browser combobox at the end of a Lighthouse run. It accounts for soft navigations and history API events. Available in navigation, timespan, and snapshot modes.\n-   (deprecated) `finalUrl`: Same value as `mainDocumentUrl`.\n\n##### Audit changes\n\n-   `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` -> `paste-preventing-inputs`\n-   `preload-lcp-image` -> `prioritize-lcp-image`\n-   `third-party-summary` no longer uses a `link` value for `item.entity`, instead uses a raw `text` value\n-   `full-page-screenshot` is no longer an audit, instead it is stored at `lhr.fullPageScreenshot`. To suppress collection of the full-page screenshot in the CLI, you must migrate from `--skip-audits full-page-screenshot` to `--disable-full-page-screenshot`.\n\n##### For Node users\n\n-   Node 14 is no longer supported, the minimum is now Node 16\n-   In case you import paths within the lighthouse node package: `lighthouse-core/` and `lighthouse-cli/` folders are now simply `core/` and `cli/`\n-   Converted from CommonJS to ES modules. You can still use lighthouse in CommonJS by using an dynamic import: `await import('lighthouse')`. For access to just the `lighthouse` function in CommonJS, you can also use `require('lighthouse/core/index.cjs')`\n-   The CSV output for Lighthouse is much more useful now. Consult the PR for [an example of the new format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13558)\n-   `LHError` is now `LighthouseError`. If you are attempting to catch an error thrown by Lighthouse, be sure to account for this!\n\n##### Node API changes\n\nThe `lighthouse` function now has [better integration with Puppeteer](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/puppeteer.md). Use `lighthouse(url, flags, config, page)` to run Lighthouse, passing an existing `Puppeteer.Page` handle as `page`.\n\nThe user flow api has moved to the top level node entrypoint and can be imported with `import {startFlow} from 'lighthouse'`.\n\nNew `flow.startNavigation()` and `flow.endNavigation()` functions let you define a user triggered navigation without any callback function. See the user flow docs for [an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/user-flows.md#triggering-a-navigation-via-user-interactions).\n\nTo change settings for a single user flow step, define the settings overrides on the toplevel flags options `flow.snapshot({skipAduits: ['uses-http2']})` instead of on the `settingsOverride` property.\n\nTo give a flow step a custom name, use `flow.snapshot({name: 'Custom name'})`. Previously this was done via `stepName`.\n\n##### For Lighthouse customization (custom config, gatherers, audits)\n\n-   To work in Lighthouse 10.0, custom gatherers will need to implement the new Gatherer interface ([an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/recipes/custom-audit/memory-gatherer.js)). Otherwise, they will only work in [legacy navigation mode](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#using-legacy-configs-in-100) and older versions of Lighthouse\n-   Lighthouse cannot use `passes` to load the page multiple times in navigation mode anymore. If you need to load the page multiple times, we recommend using a user flow. See our config docs for instructions on [how to convert to the new config format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#legacy-configs)\n-   The `ScriptElements` artifact is now `Scripts`, with a [slightly different shape](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/955586c4e05d501d69a79d4ef0297991b6805690/types/artifacts.d.ts#L317)\n-   `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails` and `Audit.makeTableDetails` now accept an options object as the third parameter. This ends up being a breaking change for just `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

E.g. previously a single node lookup could take as long as 30s on a large app and now it takes ~30ms.\r\n2. Avoids interrupting the entire migration if the language service throws an error when making a lookup.\r\n3.

standalone, but it does not import `HelloComponent`.\r\n\r\n`ng test` hence throws:\r\n```\r\nChrome 110.0.0.0 (Mac OS 10.15.7) HelloComponent should display hello FAILED\r\n\tError: NG0304: 'app-hello' is not a known element (used in the 'TestComponent' component template):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding `imports: [HelloComponent]` to `TestComponent`\r\n\r\nAlso note that in an ideal scenario `configureTestingModule` could be simplified to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  beforeEach(() => TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    imports: [TestComponent] // no need for HelloComponent\r\n

The new rules are as follows (copied from TypeScript's PR description):\n\n    > When a potential type argument list is followed by\n    >\n    > -   a line break,\n    > -   an `(` token,\n    > -   a template literal string, or\n    > -   any token except `<` or `>` that isn't the start of an expression,\n    >\n    > we consider that construct to be a type argument list.

This means that these CSS files are no longer be tree-shaken.\n\n    Importing CSS into JS causes esbuild to automatically create a CSS entry point next to the JS entry point containing the bundled CSS. Previously packages that specified some form of `\"sideEffects\": false` could potentially cause esbuild to consider one or more of the JS files on the import path to the CSS file to be side-effect free, which would result in esbuild removing that CSS file from the bundle. This was problematic because the removal of that CSS is outwardly observable, since all CSS is global, so it was incorrect for previous versions of esbuild to tree-shake CSS files imported into JS files.\n\n-   Add constant folding for certain additional equality cases ([#&#8203;2394](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2394), [#&#8203;2895](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2895))\n\n    This release adds constant folding for expressions similar to the following:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original input\n    console.log(\n      null === 'foo',\n      null === undefined,\n      null == undefined,\n      false === 0,\n      false == 0,\n      1 === true,\n      1 == true,\n    )\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(\n      null === \"foo\",\n      null === void 0,\n      null == void 0,\n      false === 0,\n      false == 0,\n      1 === true,\n      1 == true\n    );\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(\n      false,\n      false,\n      true,\n      false,\n      true,\n      false,\n      true\n    );\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Some components use images that are added as assets within this library.\r\n\r\nWhen I do a production build and push it to NPM, everything seems to go right, but when using the library in our app, the images don't show. I get a 404 error. Now, this issue is one that many people have been getting for years, so it seems, but **never has been resolved**. All related tickets have timed out and gotten closed after some time.\r\n\r\nSome points worth mentioning:\r\n- The assets are **successfully included** (in a folder called `assets`) in the library. If I go to `node_modules/my-lib` I can see that they are there, so the problem is not the assets configuration.\r\n- The images are small .svg's that work fine otherwise. They have only letters and a dash in the name, no spaces or other special characters.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be related to how the image paths/references are compiled. Because when I include the image in the assets folder of the application that uses the library, **it does work**. Apparently the library looks for images based on the consuming app's directory rather than the library's root itself.\r\nI've spent over two days trying all sorts of configurations and ways to refer to the images, but nothing works. I'm at my wit's end here.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to show the images simply in an img tag: `<img src=\"assets/my-picture.svg\" />`\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\nMy folder structure is like this:\r\n```\r\nmy-lib\r\n  /package.json\r\n  /projects\r\n    /my-lib // This is the folder that the production build targets\r\n      /package.json\r\n      /src\r\n        /assets\r\n        ...\r\n      ...\r\n  /src //this is the local test application which is not part of the build/library\r\n    /app\r\n    ...    \r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI build it using the command `ng build vitas-toolkit --configuration production`\r\n\r\n```\r\n// ng-package.json\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n      \"input\": \"src/assets\",\r\n      \"output\": \"/assets\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"./src/_lib/styles\"\r\n  ],\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.7\r\nng-packagr                      14.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24695","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Images from library don't load, but are included\" (#24695)"},{"Id":"1579055686","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-10T06:15:36","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24693","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b919d8e` -> `a4c45cc` |\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `f7d26a0` -> `e859696` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `70c532c` -> `9da5c25` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `6900a57` -> `8192a5c` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a84f3b7` -> `6278948` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `cc9fd43` -> `3031038` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `1d70e3f` -> `7be6af6` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `12daf06` -> `196f78a` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `8c0fb39` -> `6d49dab` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ac762c4` -> `f53d41a` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `66d3823` -> `39e9f7a` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a1456c8` -> `c0f4029` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8aa6041` -> `812783e` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b02757c` -> `ce77ad5` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `6709be7` -> `915150c` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `703d48c` -> `5beab9b` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fa06548` -> `c0483a1` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2657adf` -> `a26c534` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `07b0f64` -> `7770251` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For example (vulnerable packages in bold):\r\n  -@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.1.1 -> karma@6.3.2.0 -> body-parser@1.20.1 -> **debug@2.6.9**\r\n  -@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.1.1 -> less@4.1.3 -> needle@3.2.0 -> **debug@3.2.7**\r\n  -@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.1.1 -> protractor@7.0.0 -> browserstack@1.6.0 -> https-proxy-agent@2.2.4 -> **debug@3.2.6**\r\n  -@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.1.1 -> glob@8.0.3 -> **inflight@1.0.6**\r\n  -@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.1.1 -> protractor@7.0.0 -> webdriver-manager@12.1.7 -> request@2.88.0 -> **qs@6.5.2**\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution [Feature Request only]\r\n\r\nI would expect that with each major release, since you're making it a major release after all, you'd update all the packages to ones without security risks.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered [Feature Request only]\r\n\r\nTo be honest, we're not sure these are really vulnerabilities to be concerned about since they are in the devkit? It's hard to tell if the scan is just detecting packages that would be running on my local box and never published out to production? If that is the case, it'd be nice to know decisively.

My usecase has a cascade/sequence of filters (MatSelects) that is needed to query the backend for 'Automobiles' that match the query. The filters are things like 'Manufacturer', 'Model' etc..... So as the consumer selects a Manufacturer, the downstream filter for Model only shows the Models that correspond to that Manufacturer (or that set of manufacturers, as I am using 'multiple' on the MatSelect). The final set of filters make a graphql query (could well be a REST API instead) to the backend that return some attributes of the selected group of Autos, e.g. mpg, etc.) So pretty straightforward design.\r\nEach filter is a multiple select filter where the end user can select multiple options on the filter. There is an 'All' option group that contains all of the options in the filter/MatSelect. Visually, the option group does what it should. But I need to programatically manipulate the option group. I have rules like - if none of the options are selected in a group, enable all the options in the group. Essentially, none is not a valid option. I need to:\r\n(1) From an option find the parent option group\r\n(2) Check if the option group has no options enabled and/or all options enabled\r\n(3) Enable/Disable the entire option group in one API call.\r\nI can provide additional details as needed.\r\nI am working with Angular material 14.2.6\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nUse cases provided in the Feature Description","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26595","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(COMPONENT): MatOptgroup should have programmatic capability\" (#26595)"},{"Id":"1576378506","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-08T15:56:13","Actor":"infacto","Number":"26594","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(datepicker): Improve/Describe type `D`","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nWhat's `D`?

Also, 'mat-elevation-z4' does not work either.\r\n <mat-toolbar>\r\n  Header Info\r\n</mat-toolbar>\r\n\r\n  <mat-sidenav-container>\r\n    <mat-sidenav>\r\n        Side Content\r\n    </mat-sidenav>  \r\n    <mat-sidenav-content class=\"content\">\r\n        Main Content\r\n    </mat-sidenav-content>\r\n  </mat-sidenav-container>\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo errors\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26592","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 15 - Material 'mat-sidenav' breaks page\" (#26592)"},{"Id":"1573060021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-06T18:19:07","Actor":"myrddraall","Number":"26578","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Style): Enabling `preserveSymlinks` breaks stylesheet","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen enabling `preserveSymlinks` in angular.json custom stylesheets no longer compile because they cannot find `@material/button/button`\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

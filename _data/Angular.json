Whenever a `ng-dev` command runs, and a TypeScript-based\r\nconfiguration file exists, `ts-node` is set up if available.\r\n\r\nThat allows consumers of the package (as the components repo) to more\r\nconveniently use a TypeScript-based configuration for dev-infra.

I looked through that PR, open issues, and other i18n-related PRs but couldn't find any mention of this. It would be really useful for the i18n extraction tooling, whenever it is released, to include support for including the `context` and `context-group`  tags as defined in the [XLIFF 1.2 Specs](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#context-group). This would make it easier to see where strings are used in source, at a glance.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nInclude `context` and `context-group` tag information in generated XLIFF files when i18n extraction support is released. An example of what this might look like in a generated XLIFF file's `trans-unit` block:\r\n```\r\n      <trans-unit id=\"0aaa61f16a4e7f7d6a1bfc6d513fb99ceec77f17\" datatype=\"html\">\r\n        <source>String 1</source>\r\n        <target>String 1 translation</target>\r\n        <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n          <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/components/examplecomponent/example.component.ts</context>\r\n          <context context-type=\"linenumber\">25</context>\r\n        </context-group>\r\n        <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n          <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/components/examplecomponent/example.component.html</context>\r\n          <context context-type=\"linenumber\">7</context>\r\n        </context-group>\r\n      </trans-unit>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nTwo alternatives would make it a little easier to back-track from string to source but have shortcomings:\r\n- <b>Option 1:</b> Use custom ids for all localized strings, and use some convention to ensure that every id is unique. The downside to this approach is that in cases where the same string needs to be used multiple times, your XLIFF file has separate entries for each instance of the string, making the XLIFF file a bit of a mess with duplicate entries.\r\n- <b>Option 2:</b> Use a custom id for all unique strings. So, every time we needed the string 'String 1', we'd specify custom id 'string1'. The issue here of course is that if someone changes the actual string used in one of those cases without changing the custom id, per the i18n documentation: *\"If you use the same id for two different text messages, only the first one is extracted, and its translation is used in place of both original text messages\"*.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37202","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Include context/context-group tags in i18n extraction tooling\" (#37202)"},{"Id":"620994193","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T17:10:42","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"37200","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 200a21f8a","State":"closed","Body":"Updating [angular#master](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master) from [cli-builds#master](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/tree/master).\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/dbde51375...200a21f8a):\n\n**Modified**\n- help/build.json","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37200","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 200a21f8a\" (#37200)"},{"Id":"621016121","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T15:15:52","Actor":"sonderbazz","Number":"37201","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(localize): da time format change","State":"closed","Body":"refactor(localize): da time format change\r\n\r\nChange separator in time format to colon instead of dot.

Not sure if this counts as regression or not. :)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have an angular library which contains a component that renders a simple list of sub components. For each item in the list, there is should be a component shown that has an input as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Input() public viewType: ViewType;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile `ViewType` is a type defined as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport type ViewType = 'card' | 'list';\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy library is compiled with ivy enabled (I am aware that it is not yet recommended to do that, but we are using the library only internally anyway and afaik that's only for compatibility reasons?). Unfortunately, with the library I am experiencing have the same issues described here https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20931 so I cannot just disable ivy build. :/\r\n\r\nIf I use this library in my angular app it won't show any item (in case of `--prod` used).\r\nIt only starts showing the items if I either\r\n- do not use `--prod` flag\r\n- turn off the optimizer (in `angular.json`)\r\n- do not build the lib with ivy\r\n\r\nI do not get any error, it just does not show the items. So the list is completely empty.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I found is not using our defined type `ViewType` but instead copy and paste its value:\r\n```\r\n@Input() public viewType: 'card' | 'list';\r\n```\r\nThis works fine but is not really what I would prefer. :/\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/mrucelum/type-for-input-app for the test app and https://github.com/mrucelum/type-for-input-lib for the example lib.\r\n\r\nClone https://github.com/mrucelum/type-for-input-app and then run `yarn install` and `yarn start:prod`.\r\n\r\nWhen you open localhost:4200 you will see a blank page.\r\n\r\nIf you run `yarn start` instead you will see \r\n```\r\nitem1\r\nitem2\r\n```\r\non the page.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo exception thrown. \r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.6\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.6\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.6\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37199","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Library build with \"ivy\" does not render components with @Input variables that have a custom TS \"type\" as type\" (#37199)"},{"Id":"620858200","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T10:21:10","Actor":"abbeboa","Number":"37197","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(api): remove api-body width for wide screens","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Everytime I modified the codes in `@hello`, it will triggered `@hello`'s rebuild, and then I moved `dist/hello` to `excellent-proj`'s `node_modules/@hello` folder;\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n**The above steps will definitely triggered Angular `ng serve`'s recompiling work**, since I got following info when I copy it into project's folder (I also tried `npm link` way too):\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: 2020-05-15T15:56:47.533Z - Hash: 188263e7942a9f784fcb\r\n5 unchanged chunks\r\n\r\nTime: 547ms\r\n\r\nWARNING in Emitted no files.\r\n\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**But the disappointed thing is that only changes in TypeScript file reflects in UI, not the html files and style files.**\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be the problem of my wrong usage of `ng build` or `ng serve` or somethiing like `cp -r folderA/ folderB/`, since I can see the new content inside project and TypeScript's changing logic, but just without html and style's changing...\r\n\r\n:-(\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.7\r\nNode: 10.18.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI searched many issues, like  with angular-cli v6, v7, v8 and also v9, such as <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2389>, <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/8168>, <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2356>, I think <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13588> issue is mostly the same as mine, however, it still remains open after more than one year.\r\n\r\nIt seems like an existing issues that not been resolved yet, is it a problem that is still under considered by your team?

This is in acceptable for an OSS project despite the fact that it is coupled to Angular.

Switzerland however has no official locale specification, so as far as I know the CLDR data is just a \"best effort\" for specifying the locale.\r\nFor example the date format in [en-CH](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/common/locales/en-CH.ts) is simply wrong (`dd/MM/y` should be `dd.MM.y`).\r\nHowever there are also minor issues with the data; e.g. floating point numbers can be separated by both `,` or `.`, but `.` is more common. Also date and time are not usually separated by `,`, but can be.\r\n\r\nSince Angular and the Angular CLI limits the customization of locale information, this becomes a problem for the projects at [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/) (national public transport provider), since the locales are specified by business for SBB projects.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like to have a feature to provide our own locales, maybe with a warning for possible imcompatibility.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n      ...\r\n      \"i18n\": {\r\n        \"locales\": {\r\n          \"de-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.de-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/de/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/de-CH\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"fr-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.fr-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/fr/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/fr-CH\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"it-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.it-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/it/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/it-CH\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"sourceLocale\": {\r\n          \"code\": \"en-CH\",\r\n          \"baseHref\": \"/en/\",\r\n          \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/en-CH\"\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis sould be doable, by changing `configureI18nBuild` in `packages\\angular_devkit\\build_angular\\src\\utils\\i18n-options.ts`, so that it tries to resolve custom locale imports before calling `findLocaleDataPath`.\r\nI'm also fine with printing a warning to point out possible incompatiblity issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are not opposed to this feature I can also provide a PR.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nEither patch the locale data after startup or register all custom locales with `registerlocaledata`, which is cumbersome.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17752","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: Provide possibility to define custom locale imports for i18n builds\" (#17752)"},{"Id":"619084578","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-18T11:31:13","Actor":"marcinowski","Number":"17737","RawContent":null,"Title":"Locale is not added to `--deployUrl` flag when using `--localize`","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm implementing the `--localize` flag in our application build. We are serving our assets from a CDN, and so far we were building separate applications with `--locale=..` which was working fine, because we knew the locale and we could just specify `--deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/${locale}`.\r\nHowever now moving to `--localize` flag I can't do that anymore, because there's a single build for all locales.\r\n\r\n#### Actual problem\r\nSince `locale` is actually added to the `--baseHref=/assets/` forming\r\n```html\r\n<href base=\"/assets/${locale}\">\r\n```  \r\nthen I would almost expect the same thing to happen with `--deployUrl` because I don't know that suffix a priori. \r\n\r\n#### Alternative solution\r\nAnother solution is constructing that path like\r\n```\r\ndeployUrl + baseHref + locale + asset/path\r\n```\r\nAnd in that case running \r\n```sh\r\n$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/ --localize\r\n```\r\nwould return the proper localized asset path with the cdn\r\n\r\n#### What I'm running\r\nSo currently my `ng build` looks like\r\n```sh\r\n$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/ --localize\r\n```\r\nand while `baseHref` works fine, the `deployUrl` points at (for example) https://cdn.com/assets/main.js instead of https://cdn.com/assets/${locale}/main.js which ends up as HTTP 404.\r\nFor the record in `app.module.ts` I have\r\n```ts\r\n{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Similar issues\r\nI was reading some other issues and probably the closest one was https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16625\r\nbut we can't grep/replace the assets because of our PWA configuration and hash checking the assets.\r\nSo is my approach wrong here? or is it actually a bug?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/marcinowski/ng-build-localize-issue\r\n`$ yarn build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/ --localize`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n```\r\n$

Each of them has different base href in their index.html file.\r\n\r\nSecond, in angular.json I have assets subsection defined like:\r\n```\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n  \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n  \"src/assets\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\nand in assets/images there are these image files (among others): \r\n- bg_login_compressed.jpg (blured version of image, small size)\r\n- bg_login.jpg (full version of image, large size)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I have a component in some nested directory within the project, that is using following css classes:\r\n```\r\n.background-init {\r\n  background-image: url(\"/assets/images/bg_login_compressed.jpg\");\r\n}\r\n.background-loaded {\r\n  background-image: url(\"/assets/images/bg_login.jpg\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, I am using root path to assets folder (starting with '/'), which is obviously wrong for base href that is not '/'.\r\nMy goal is to have div initialized with blured version of image, which is later replaced by full version. This is how I am doing it:\r\nTemplate:\r\n```\r\n<div  [class.background-init]=\"!backgroundIsLoaded\" [class.background-loaded]=\"backgroundIsLoaded\">\r\n```\r\nTypescript:\r\n```\r\npublic backgroundIsLoaded = false;\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  const img = new Image();\r\n  img.src = './assets/images/bg_login.jpg';\r\n\r\n  img.onload = () => {\r\n    this.backgroundIsLoaded= true;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is ok during local development when running `ng serve` without base href parameter:\r\n- .css images are found\r\n- .ts image is found and loaded\r\n- both .css and .ts bg_login.jpg file is searched in the same path (= refer to the same file)\r\n\r\nIf I run `ng serve --base-href /de/`, which simulates run from production environment on IIS:\r\n- .css images are not found (they are searched in path '/assets/images/' instead of '/de/assets/images/')\r\n- .ts image is found and loaded\r\n- as a result, no images are shown as the background\r\n\r\nOk: let's switch to relative paths in .css url path, as advised in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4778#issuecomment-280773798:\r\n```\r\n.background-init {\r\n  background-image: url(\"../../../assets/images/bg_login_compressed.jpg\");\r\n}\r\n.background-loaded {\r\n  background-image: url(\"../../../assets/images/bg_login.jpg\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOn local development without base href it is working fine, as well as with --base-href /de/.\r\nBUT what this causes when building? The files used in relative paths are **copied** from /assets/images/ to root directory of each localized build. This is unwanted and inpractical for many reasons described e.g. here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14587#issuecomment-546921827 !!!\r\nSide effect of this solution is:\r\n- .css image bg_login.jpg is searched in root path (of the build)\r\n- .ts image bg_login.jpg is searched in /assets/images/ path\r\n- that's why the code for replacing the background images will not work as desired (the image is loaded twice instead of once on the same path)\r\n\r\nOther solutions that I tried:\r\n- using of rebaseRootRelativeCssUrls: not working on production and considered deprecated\r\n- using tilde in the .css path, such as url('~/assets/images/bg_login.jpg'): not working on production\r\n- using caret in the .css path, such as url('^assets/images/bg_login.jpg'): not working on production and officially not supported (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/12797#issuecomment-598559534)\r\n\r\n**I am searching for a clean solution which:**\r\n- finds the images in the paths\r\n- doesn't copy the images when using relative css paths\r\n- is able to link to the same file when loading both from css and from ts\r\n- works on local and on production environment\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of similar issues here on git are already locked due to inactivity, that's why I am creating this new one.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.6\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.6\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.1.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.6\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.7.5\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17747","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assets, base href and relative urls in css/scss\" (#17747)"},{"Id":"619432695","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-16T11:57:06","Actor":"mrhili","Number":"17743","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR EVERYWHERE ng new","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x ] new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI trying doing ng new and everytime i get the error\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre>\r\nλ ng new randomImages\r\n?

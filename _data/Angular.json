Developers may still need to use `provideZonelessChangeDetection` in the providers if the application exists alongside another one that uses ZoneJS (because ZoneJS would then be present and the zone-based change detection scheduler would then be selected). For most applications, this will be sufficient for selecting the correct scheduler without needing the provider.\r\n\r\nThis is one step towards zoneless by default, but does not yet go as far as removing the `provideZoneChangeDetection` from the internals. That would/will be larger breaking change since it will require existing Zone-based applications to manually include `provideZoneChangeDetection` to the application providers (and for all tests).\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Applications that configure a custom zoneless implementation now and _do not_ want the Angular zoneless scheduler to be enabled will need to include `provideZoneChangeDetection` as well as a provider for `NgZone` in the application providers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {providers: [\r\n  provideZoneChangeDetection(),\r\n  {provide: NgZone, useClass: MyNoopNgZone}\r\n]});\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62655","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): Remove `provideZonelessChangeDetection` requirement when ZoneJS is not present\" (#62655)"},{"Id":"3233618212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T20:31:30","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"62653","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(signal-forms): more ergonomic metadata key creation","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62653","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(signal-forms): more ergonomic metadata key creation\" (#62653)"},{"Id":"3231966686","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T20:24:52","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"62644","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): more permissive parsing of @ characters ","State":"closed","Body":"When we introduced blocks, we made a deliberate decision to treat the `@` character as a reserved character in case we need to use it for other syntax in the future.

These use compilation mode partial. \nThis work perfectly up until @angular 20.0.x.\nSo the problems i encountered:\n- some elements not renderer well and causing other elements not to be renders\n- issue with viewchild\n- issues with mat buttons in mat dialogs\n\nI could isolate the problem to @angular/compiler and/or @angular/compiler-cli (both versions need to be the same). I did this by gradually updating each package to 21.1.\n\nIf we use compilation mode full in the \\@my-company libraries then it works. But I can't just move to this system as we also have third party libraries which are partially compiled.\n\nWhen I read the documentation there seems to be something new in the compiler regarding 'optimized template compilation'. So my guess the problem is related to this area.\n\nProbably some elements are jitted but something doesnt work out and is being skipped?\n\nIt's a critical problem because we have 50+ applications running with this architecture (externals and cdn-like bundles. We wouldn't like to lock on 20.0.x.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62647","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"angular strange behavior when migrating from angular 20.0.x to 20.1.x regarding @angular/compiler and/or @angular/compiler-cli\" (#62647)"},{"Id":"3232130189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T12:49:23","Actor":"pavankjadda","Number":"62646","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fixes typo in `httpResource` example","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This lets Angular know that certain elements should be treated as custom elements and skip component resolution, we can specify the `isCustomElement` option.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppWithCustomElementsComponent],\r\n  // Custom function to determine what counts as a custom element\r\n  isCustomElement: (tag: string) => {\r\n    // Allow elements that start with 'polymer-', 'lit-', or 'my-'\r\n    return tag.startsWith('polymer-') || tag.startsWith('lit-') || tag.startsWith('my-');\r\n  },\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'complex-custom-element-detection',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      <stencil-component>Stencil Component</stencil-component>\r\n      <angular-elements>Angular Elements</angular-elements>\r\n      <vue-custom-element>Vue Custom Element</vue-custom-element>\r\n      <legacy-element>Legacy Element</legacy-element>\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n  isCustomElement: (tag: string) => {\r\n    // More complex logic for different types of custom elements\r\n    const customElementPrefixes = ['stencil-', 'angular-', 'vue-'];\r\n    const allowedElements = new Set(['legacy-element']);\r\n\r\n    return customElementPrefixes.some(prefix => tag.startsWith(prefix)) || \r\n           allowedElements.has(tag);\r\n  },\r\n})\r\nexport class ComplexCustomElementDetectionComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the way Vuejs prevents errors with custom elements without breaking validation for framework components.\r\n\r\n## Does this

It only applies updates for global styles (styles.scss). Any changes to component templates (inline or external .html files) or component-scoped styles (inline or external .scss files) result in a full-page reload, and component state is lost (e.g., text in an input field is cleared).\n\nThis issue persists across multiple environments and configurations:\n\nIt is not an SSR issue: The problem occurs in brand-new projects generated with and without SSR (ng new --ssr=false).\n\nIt is not a Node.js version issue: Tested on multiple supported Node.js versions, including 20.16, 20.17, and the latest 22.x LTS.\n\nIt is not a local environment issue: The problem is reproducible on both a native Windows machine and inside a clean Linux environment using VS Code Dev Containers (Docker).\n****\nThe file watcher is working: When using --poll inside Docker, changes are detected, but it still results in a full reload instead of HMR.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nAngular CLI: v20 or later\n\nNode.js: v22 (LTS)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Create a new, clean Angular application without SSR.\n\n`ng new hmr-repro-app --ssr=false\n`\n2. Navigate into the new project directory.\n\n`cd hmr-repro-app\n`\n3. Add a simple input field to the component template to test state preservation. Open \nsrc/app/app.component.html and replace its content with:\n\n```\n<h1>HMR Test</h1>\n<p>Type something in the input below, then change this text.</p>\n<input type=\"text\" />\n```\n\n4. Serve the application.\n\n5. ng serve\n\n6. Open the application in the browser. Type some text into the input field.\n\n7. Now, go back to src/app/app.component.html and change the text in the <p> tag. Save the file.\n\nExpected Result\nThe text paragraph on the page should update instantly via HMR without a full-page reload. The text you typed into the input field should remain because the component's state is preserved.\n\nActual Result\nThe browser performs a full-page reload. The text typed into the input field is cleared, which proves that HMR has failed and the component's state was destroyed and re-created.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.1.0\nNode: 22.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.0\n@schematics/angular          20.1.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis issue does not appear to be specific to any single environment, as it has been reproduced under multiple conditions.\n\n- **Browser:** Tested on the latest version of Google Chrome.\n- **Operating System:** The issue is reproducible on both native Windows and on Linux (when running inside a VS Code Dev Container).\n- **Package Manager:** npm\n- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30714","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HMR works only for Global styles.

Web-Workers when enforcing Trusted Types in @angular/build:application builder","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nIt is possible to create a  web worker using the `new Worker(new URL('<workerfile>', import.meta.url))` syntax, and in the build output, the url will be replaced, so the worker script can be downloaded.\n\nHowever, when additionally enforcing Trusted Types, at runtime an error can occur: \"TypeError: Failed to construct 'Worker': This document requires 'TrustedScriptURL' assignment.\", as the emitted script code would attempt to instantiate the `Worker` using an `URL` instance rather than a `TrustedScriptUrl`.\n\nWhile working around the `TypeError` e.g. by employing the Angular `DomSanitizer` like this: `new Worker(this.#sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.RESOURCE_URL, this.#sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(new URL('<workerfile>', import.meta.url).toString())))`, might prevent the `TypeError`, it would also break the replacement of the worker url.\n\nIt might be helpful, if there were a way of being able to use both the build-time replacement of the worker url and `TrustedScriptUrl`.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have considered trying if switching to a builder different from @angular/build:application might provide better support for the use case.\nI have considered disabling the enforcement of Trusted Types.\nI have considered moving the worker script to a static url that can be used without replacement at build type.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30703","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support Web-Workers when enforcing Trusted Types in

Developers are forced to avoid adding any js/ts file to the polyfills array. Instead, they have to create js scripts inline inside index.html, or write js files, and include them as assets with index.html\n\n---\n\nThe problem is within these lines:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/2c3a46b9ecf69049fbddb2c912636d9d62e197df/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/utils.ts#L469-L478\n\nThe presence of *any* js/ts file in the polyfills array causes zone to be included, even though I uninstalled zone.js and do everything zone-less-ly.\n\nI had a file called `polyfill-buffer.ts` which I used to add to the polyfill array:\n```ts\nimport { Buffer } from 'buffer';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nNow I have to add it to index.html as a script\n```js\nimport { Buffer } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buffer/+esm';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nThis is maintainable for small scripts like these.

I would have expected something like this to work, but it doesn't:\n\n```html\n<mat-select \n  formControlName=\"state\"\n  autocomplete=\"address-level1\">\n  ...\n</mat-select>\n```\n\nHere's a demo site showing it not working: https://gorgeous-palmier-877897.netlify.app/\n\nSTR:\n1. Visit https://gorgeous-palmier-877897.netlify.app/ in a browser where you have a US address stored\n2. Click into the \"Street Address\" field, which should trigger the browser's autofill UI, and select an address\n3. Notice how all of the fields populate except the state dropdown.\n\nMany other component libraries support this feature by using a visually hidden `<select>` element that gets synchronized with the custom select component, and I believe it should be possible for `<mat-select>` to do the same.\n\nNote: the code for the demo I linked above can be found here: https://bolt.new/~/sb1-mm4oni4x\n\n### Use Case\n\nForm submissions that generate errors because they're not fully filled out are a top user frustration.

When scrolled to certain positions, there's extra lines shown at the top and bottom of the form field. The length of the lines matches the length of the label, and it seems like it could be related to the \"will-change: auto;\" property being set since it disappears when that's deselected in devtools.

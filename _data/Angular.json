Any given disconnect _could_ be followed by a subsequent attach and any arbitrary time in the future, or could be reclaimed by the GC. There's fundamentally no way to know.\n\nThe role of Angular Elements is to translate these semantics into something reasonable for existing Angular components.\n\nCurrently on `connectedCallback` we create a component and attach it to the `ApplicationRef`. On `disconnectedCallback` we destroy that component. In theory, reattach should then recreate the component, though that's [a little broken right now](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38778).\n\nI think this is flawed, because it loses any internal component state as part of the destroy process. We need the component to be inert and disabled but able to be reactivated in the future if it is reconnected. Basically, custom elements want an activate/deactivate lifecycle, but Angular only provides a destroy lifecycle, with no way to \"undestroy\" a component.\n\nI think ideally:\n* `connectedCallback()` should just call `appRef.attachView` (plus `createComponent` on first connect).\n* `disconnectedCallback()` should just call `appRef.detachView` to deactivate it.\n\nIn this model, each reattachment to the DOM is just a pair of `attachView` and `detachView` calls managing its relationship with the `ApplicationRef` and the overall app lifecycle. When detached, the component should be inert and eligible for GC if not otherwise referenced. I'm not sure if that's actually possible today though or if you _have_ to call `ComponentRef.prototype.destroy` to break some reference which would otherwise retain it.\n\nWe would probably need new `ngOnConnected` and `ngOnDisconnected` lifecycle hooks which would allow a component to acquire and release resources compatible with this model. Otherwise a component containing a simple timer would never be reclaimable, this mechanism would be necessary to disable/re-enable the timer when the component is removed/readded. These hooks need to be available for _every_ component, not just the root component converted into a custom element, since any of them might be rendered as a descendant of the custom element.\n\nOne more challenge is that there is no appropriate time to call `ngOnDestroy` since we don't know a component should be destroyed until it gets GC'd. We'd either need to remove this hook altogether, or potentially link the Angular component to its custom element via a `WeakRef` and use a `FinalizationRegistry` to detect when the custom element is reclaimed and call `ComponentRef.prototype.destroy` in response. I'm very loathe to expose GC timing into application logic, but I don't think there's any other opportunity to do this.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qogge9cd?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Findex.html&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nv20\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Elements Lifecycle is Broken\" (#64229)"},{"Id":"3483139874","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-04T03:28:51","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"64228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Elements content projection should require Shadow DOM","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nelements\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nAngular Elements currently supports \"content projection\" from the initial render during component upgrade when children are already present.\n\nMy main issue with it is that neither the DOM nor custom elements have any meaningful semantics for what \"content projection\" means in a way compatible with Angular. You can always create a DOM element and then add children to it, but if that element is creating children of its own, there is no distinction between its children and your \"content projected\" children. This conceptual flaw manifests in a few ways.\n\nFirst, Angular only performs content projection on component upgrade (typically when attached to the document). If you later add children to the element, this does not get projected into an `<ng-content>` slot and just gets appended to the host element.\n\nSecond, content projection may _move_ elements, meaning what originally looks like:\n\n```html\n<my-comp>\n  <div id=\"hello\">Hello, World!</div>\n</my-comp>\n```\n\nPost-upgrade might suddenly look like:\n\n```html\n<my-comp>\n  <div>Goodbye, World!</div>\n  <span>\n    <div id=\"hello\">Hello, World!</div>\n  </span>\n</my-comp>\n```\n\nThe component's internal template confuses the expected contract of content projection. `myComp.firstElementChild` no longer refers to `#hello`, and instead refers to `#goodbye`. This is relatively understandable in the context of a light DOM tree, but it means that we've lost the distinction between the projected content and the internal component content. This is necessary to _change_ the projected content, which is no longer easily possible. Even if you keep a reference to the projected element and replace it in the DOM, Angular retains a reference to the old element and will continue to project it.\n\nThis movement also makes it impossible to recreate the underlying Angular component because moving the projected children means we can no longer find them as direct children of the custom element, the process is not repeatable. This is problematic for [managing the component lifecycle](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64229) as indicated [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38778#issuecomment-690433315).\n\nIt is my belief that content projection as Angular understands it is fundamentally incompatible with custom elements and the way the DOM works. I think the only sane behavior here is to remove the feature altogether and require Angular Elements to be empty during the initial render, allowing Angular full control over their contents.\n\nI think the one subcase which can be made to work is if the underlying Angular component uses `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`. This solves most of the conceptual issues as the light/shadow distinction disambiguates between elements provided in content projection and elements owned by the component template directly. Consumers can mutate element children at any time and see those reflected in the expected way. This likely requires some non-trivial changes to Angular internals to make content projection fit the `<slot>` model, but at least in theory I believe this does \"square the circle\" with respect to content projection in custom elements.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-9edtpmzx?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Findex.html&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nv20\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Elements content projection should require Shadow DOM\" (#64228)"},{"Id":"3482872926","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-03T23:48:59","Actor":"Gouvernathor","Number":"64227","RawContent":null,"Title":"Zoneless tutorial doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nAfter following the procedure [here](https://angular.dev/guide/zoneless) to make my project zoneless, by adding `provideZonelessChangeDetection(),` in `app.config.server.ts`, the following error appeared when trying to serve the application : `Error: NG0408: Invalid change detection configuration: provideZoneChangeDetection and provideZonelessChangeDetection cannot be used together.`. That error's message is quite explicit, but it's not listed in the doc's error encyclopedia, and neither is it mentioned in the Zoneless tutorial page.\n\nAfter removing `provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),` from `app.config.ts`, it then fails **in the browser** (which is not a stage at which I would want it to fail), saying in the console that `Error: NG0908: In this configuration Angular requires Zone.js`.

all: no disagreement this is an extreme scenario.

Add a static assets such as 'src/assets/image/add-0.0.1.svg'.\n\n2. Add the assets configuration to angular.json:\n\n```\n\"build\": {\n  ...\n  \"assets\": [\"src/assets\"],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n3. Run the application with 'ng test --browsers Chromium --watch'.\n\n4. Check if static assets is served at:\n\nhttp://localhost:63315/assets/image/add-0.0.1.svg\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.0-next.6\nNode.js           : 22.18.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 10.9.3\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────┬───────────────┐\n│ Package                   │ Version       │\n├───────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ @angular/build            │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/cli              │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/common           │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/compiler         │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli     │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/core             │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/forms            │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/platform-browser │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ @angular/router           │ 21.0.0-next.6 │\n│ rxjs                      │ 7.8.2         │\n│ typescript                │ 5.9.3         │\n└───────────────────────────┴───────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/builder:unit-test does not serve static assets at the correct output path\" (#31388)"},{"Id":"3483976932","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-04T17:09:19","Actor":"hheexx","Number":"31387","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular SSR - PM2 cluster support","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nplatform-server\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently to scale Angular SSR beyond 1 core if you use PM2 you must have nginx in front with configured upstreams on multiple ports.

version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2.12\n\n### Description\n\nHi, \n\nI have recently migrated from an angular 18 project to the 20 version. \n\nI have a custom library and an app. To gain time and avoid multiple builds and having to build both the lib and the app I have referenced the lib (which is a dependency in the app) with paths to the local project in the tsconfig of the app. \n\nWhen doing this, I referenced my public_api.ts and doing so, I don't have to build watch the library, any changes made in the library is automatically picked up by the serve of the app and a rebuild is done as if it was a change in the app. \n\nDoing the same thing in angular 20 does not work, I have made some researchand read somewhere that the paths cannot react if it's not in the same workspace.\n\nShould we not have a property somewhere to activate this ?\n\nI have recreated a small lib and small app in angular 18 it works, in angular 20 I cannot manage to make it happen.\n\nThank you in advance \n\nRegards\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a lib in a folder\nCreate an app in another folder\nInstall the lib as a dependency in the app\nIn the tsconfig add a path property and

This breaks runtime behavior for certain classes, notably RippleRenderer.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nUse Angular 16.1.x with a project that relies on RippleRenderer (from Angular CDK).\n\nEnsure production build with optimization enabled (\"optimization\": true).\n\nStart the application and interact with any element using ripples.\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nErrors appear in console multiple times:\n\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'addHandler')\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'removeHandler')\n\n\nAfter navigating back and re-opening a task, the task does not open because _eventManager is undefined.\n\n**Technical details:**\n\nThe original TypeScript code:\n\nprivate static _eventManager = new RippleEventManager();\n\n\nGenerated JavaScript in older builds (March 2025 snapshot):\n\nPA._eventManager = new Pv;\n\n\nGenerated JavaScript in newer builds (September 2025 snapshot, before optimization):\n\nstatic #_ = _staticBlock1 = () => this._eventManager = new RippleEventManager();\n/*#__PURE__*/_staticBlock1();\n\nIn production builds, the call to _staticBlock1() is removed during optimization (is annoted by PURE), leaving _eventManager uninitialized.\n\n**Temporary workaround:**\n\nPinning the caniuse-lite database to a version prior to March 2025 prevents Angular from generating the private static block:\n\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"caniuse-lite\": \"<=1.0.30001700\"\n}\n\n\nThis restores the working behavior for _eventManager.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nStatic initialization blocks must be executed even in production builds with optimizations.\n\n_eventManager should be properly initialized, regardless of optimization/minification.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.2.16\nNode: 18.20.2\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.6\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 16.2.12\n... animations, common, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router, service-worker\n\nPackage                            Version\n------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1602.16\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      16.2.16\n@angular-devkit/core               16.2.16\n@angular-devkit/schematics         16.2.16\n@angular/cdk                       16.2.14\n@angular/cli                       16.2.16\n@angular/flex-layout               15.0.0-beta.42\n@angular/material                  16.2.14\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   16.2.14\n@schematics/angular                14.2.13\nng-packagr                         16.1.0\nrxjs                               7.8.2\ntypescript                         5.1.6\nzone.js                            0.13.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31370","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Production build drops execution of static initialization block (static #_)\" (#31370)"},{"Id":"3476996918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-02T10:37:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31367","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rules_browsers digest to 21c730b (20.3.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| rules_browsers | git_override | digest | `6749ba4` -> `21c730b` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Before this change, signal inputs in custom elements required function calls to access their values (`elementRef.newInput()`), while decorator inputs were accessed directly (`elementRef.oldInput`). This inconsistency caused confusion and typing difficulties.\n\n  The getter behavior has been standardized so signal inputs can now be accessed directly, matching the behavior of decorator inputs:\n\n  Before:\n\n  - Decorator Input: `elementRef.oldInput`\n  - Signal Input: `elementRef.newInput()`\n\n  After:\n\n  - Decorator Input: `elementRef.oldInput`\n  - Signal Input: `elementRef.newInput`\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [99c5269ee8](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/99c5269ee86bbdfa9026c3a69d21afd6d46c668b) | feat | Support of optional keys for the KeyValue pipe ([#&#8203;48814](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/48814)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [159be56709](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/159be56709f34e6f996b92929788e49001e3a5d5) | fix  | recover template literals with broken expressions ([#&#8203;64150](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/64150)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [1cb16fddb5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/1cb16fddb58419d3bc2a5855471c67635eec7353) | fix  | Fixes animations in conjunction with content projection ([#&#8203;63776](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63776))                |\n| [8a0c9ca8be](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8a0c9ca8bee3c3c5ff4a79980a501312b3f94488) | fix  | prevents unintended early termination of leave animations and hoisting ([#&#8203;64088](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/64088)) |\n\n##### elements\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [be0455adda](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/be0455adda7d92f741105b3599e7922f099cc024) | fix  | return value on signal input getter ([#&#8203;62113](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/62113)) |\n\n##### migrations\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [51a0b59389](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/51a0b593898f2d1afd14817405695092ae39d5ea) | fix  | handle shorthand property declarations in NgModule ([#&#8203;64160](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/64160)) |\n| [31bc9e4111](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/31bc9e41116a87af37809bd45514d5ec7969d50c) | fix  | skip migration for inputs with 'this' references ([#&#8203;64142](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/64142))   |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - Every 2 hours, between 12:00 AM and 10:59 PM ( * 0-22/2 * * * ) in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When you navigate between months, Angular gets confused about which DOM elements to keep and which to remove.\r\n\r\n## How I fixed it\r\nI updated the `_trackRow` function to create more stable tracking keys by combining the row index with the first cell's value. This way Angular can properly track elements when the month changes.\r\n\r\n**Changed files:**\r\n- `calendar-body.ts` - Fixed the tracking function\r\n- `calendar-body.html` - Updated template to use the new function signature  \r\n- `month-view.spec.ts` - Added a test to make sure this doesn't break again\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- ✅ Range picker no longer crashes when navigating months\r\n- ✅ All existing calendar features still work\r\n- ✅ Added regression test\r\n\r\nThis is a small, targeted fix that doesn't change any public APIs or break existing functionality.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31969","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/datepicker): prevent crash during range picker navigation\" (#31969)"},{"Id":"3475782811","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-02T04:12:39","Actor":"Mr-KRAMA","Number":"31968","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): ensure selected event fires after form control value is updated","State":"closed","Body":"## Fix timepicker event ordering issue\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\nThe timepicker was firing the `selected` event before updating the form control value.

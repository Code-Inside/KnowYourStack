The `core` identifier refers to the parameter on the factory function, which is effectively a namespace for an import. The wrapper and function declaration looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"(function (global, factory) {\r\n\ttypeof exports === 'object' && typeof module !== 'undefined' ? factory(exports, require('@angular/core'), require('@angular/cdk/coercion'), require('rxjs'), require('rxjs/operators'), require('@angular/cdk/platform'), require('@angular/cdk/bidi'), require('@angular/cdk/collections')) :\r\n\ttypeof define === 'function' && define.amd ? define('@angular/cdk/scrolling', ['exports', '@angular/core', '@angular/cdk/coercion', 'rxjs', 'rxjs/operators', '@angular/cdk/platform', '@angular/cdk/bidi', '@angular/cdk/collections'], factory) :\r\n\t(factory((global.ng = global.ng || {}, global.ng.cdk = global.ng.cdk || {}, global.ng.cdk.scrolling = {}),global.ng.core,global.ng.cdk.coercion,global.rxjs,global.rxjs.operators,global.ng.cdk.platform,global.ng.cdk.bidi,global.ng.cdk.collections));\r\n}(this, (function (exports,core,coercion,rxjs,operators,platform,bidi,collections) { 'use strict';\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the factory function that declares `core` as a parameter is `function (exports,core,coercion,rxjs,operators,platform,bidi,collections) { ... }`.\r\n\r\nWhen ngcc tries to compile this file, it tries to statically resolve `core.ViewEncapsulation.None` and then fails because it cannot resolve the `core` (`Parameter`) node.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe error can be seen in the integration test for the ngcc UMD support PR (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/25445).

I've first tried implementing it in 7.0.* where the behaviour was the same.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe goal is a navigation with anchor links which are highlighted as active whenever the route points to the link's (complete) url (e.g. _/foo/bar#one_).\r\n\r\nThe issue manifests itself when working with _routerLink_, _routerLinkActive_, _routerLinkActiveOptions_, and _fragment_. When setting _routerLinkActiveOptions_ to `{exact: true}`, according to [the documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLinkActive#routerLinkActiveOptions), the router is expected to set the _routerLink_ as active only if the url matches exactly. By my assumption this includes parameters and anchor tags as well - otherwise it would not make much sense to set `[routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\"` at all.\r\nHowever, this is not the case, as every link that points to the same (routerLink) url is set as active.\r\n\r\nWhile researching the issue I found a [PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27108) that targets a similar behaviour with url parameters (related to [#19399](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19399) and [#20698](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20698)).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[→ StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/dvl-ng-router-anchorscrolling)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\"@angular/compiler\": \"^7.1.1\",\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"^7.1.1\",\r\n\"@angular/common\": \"^7.1.1\",\r\n\"@angular/router\": \"^7.1.1\",</code></pre>\r\n[→ Link to package.json](https://stackblitz.com/edit/dvl-ng-router-anchorscrolling?file=package.json)\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nThe behaviour persists in the following browsers (all that I tested):\r\n\r\nWindows 10:\r\n- Chrome 70\r\n- Firefox 63\r\n- Edge 42\r\n- IE 11\r\n\r\nMac OS Mojave:\r\n- Safari 12\r\n- Chrome 70\r\n- Firefox 63","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27450","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Router - routerLinkActive ignores fragments\" (#27450)"},{"Id":"387124404","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-04T05:16:50","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"27449","RawContent":null,"Title":" test(ivy): add ability to find already passing tests","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27449","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \" test(ivy): add ability to find already passing tests\" (#27449)"},{"Id":"387069751","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-04T00:46:30","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"27446","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ivy symbol test","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27446","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ivy symbol test\" (#27446)"},{"Id":"387069478","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-04T00:45:12","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"27445","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(bazel): end-to-end test for ng new with Bazel","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The application loads the home page('/' route) properly.\r\n\r\n1. When I go to any chid route and then refresh the browser then this application throws a 404 error.\r\n\"This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback. There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404).\"\r\n\r\n2. It allows me to go other routes only using the home page anchor tags or buttons, I mean, If I type a child route path in the browser directly and hit enter then the page does not automatically refresh. Similarly, If I am on one route and then try to go back using the chrome back button(top left corner) then the only URL gets updated but the page remains the same.\r\n\r\n3. Home page route in the browser is localserver:PORT_NUMBER/index.html but When I click on any link tag or fragment then this index.html part disappears and the route becomes localserver:PORT_NUMBER/<new_route>    So is there any way such that I can stop index.html disappearance. \r\nThe above behavior is necessary because later this custom-element tag will be inserted in some other applications specific route page and we don't our application to modify their URL when user interacts with our application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.7\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\nIvy Workspace:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core         9.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   9.1.7\r\n@schematics/angular          9.1.7\r\n@schematics/update           0.901.7\r\nrxjs\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Haven't seen this work correctly yet.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using build configurations for ng build you can overwrite the default build options.  For example you set the optimization option to 'true' in the default section and overwrite it to 'false' for a local testing configuration.  Ng build works fine and you get what you would expect.  When you use ng serve and specify that configuration you end up getting a mix of the default values and the configuration values.  Specifically, you seem to get the default values set in the ng build section for options that match naming of options that exist in ng serve.  I.E.  The optimization setting when using ng serve is now 'true' instead of getting 'false'.  If you simply remove the default setting in ng build it now correctly picks up the configuration setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere is a sample angular.json stripped down to just the necessary bits.\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{\r\n    \"projects\": {\r\n        \"test\": {\r\n            \"architect\": {\r\n                \"build\": {\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"optimization\": true\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"configurations\": {\r\n                        \"local\": {\r\n                            \"optimization\": false\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                \"serve\": {\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"browserTarget\": \"test:build\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"configurations\": {\r\n                        \"local\": {\r\n                            \"browserTarget\": \"test:build:local\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen running `ng serve -c local` you end up with optimization set to true.  If you remove the default value it picks up the value in the configuration.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.0\r\nNode: 12.16.2     \r\nOS: win32 x64     \r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.0\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.0\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.0\r\nng-packagr                         9.1.0\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI believe the inheritance only fails to work on properties that have a similar name for both ng serve and ng build.

Everything seemed fine, but as soon as I started changing JSON files in my assets folder (assets/api/test.json) I noticed a problem. Webpack registers the change I make to the file, but the old file is still served. \r\n\r\nSay I add a record to the JSON file `{ \"foo\": \"bar\" }`, the compiler sees the change and starts compiling. After that the webpage is refreshed (like expected), but the JSON file is not updated, the previous version is still served. \r\n\r\nIn order to check if my project was the problem I created a new, empty, CLI project (Angular CLI 9.0.4). I am having the same issue here. It is not even picking up any now JSON files I add to the assets folder. It does add them in the build folder on a production build, but the files are missing on `serve`. \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nSee [this minimal reproduction](https://github.com/RobinvanTienhoven/test-asset-loading).\r\nChange a line in the `assets/api/test.json`. Angular will update the app, but the http call will still return a 404 not found on the file.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo error code\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.4\r\nNode: 12.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\nIvy Workspace:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core         9.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   9.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular          9.0.4\r\n@schematics/update           0.900.4\r\nrxjs                         6.5.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17828","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 9 assets not updating\" (#17828)"},{"Id":"627700158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-30T10:32:55","Actor":"ilprima","Number":"17826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 9 Lazy Loading with arrow functions no chunks and big main.js","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

attribute has no effect in mat-select, if `mat-label` is provided also.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nForked from the [mat-select example in the documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview): \r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qlpnim-vyfruq?file=src/app/select-overview-example.html\r\n```\r\n<h4>Basic

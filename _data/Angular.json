Now, pipes are supported as well.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, this is a bit tricky, especially in the case where an `NgModule` must be imported. Previously, we used an approximation: we looked at the Component's metadata, and just imported the declaring NgModule. However, this is not technically correct -- the NgModule that declares it is *not* necessarily the same one that exports it for the current scope. (In fact, there could be multiple re-exports!)\r\n\r\nAt present, the compiler doesn't track the declaring NgModule on pipe metadata. So rather than extend the old, inaccurate approach to pipes, I have implemented a more general solution.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new reader on the template type checker, called a `GlobalMetadataReader`. This reader lazily initializes its indices, so time is only spent when the global data is requested. Internally, the reader conducts a breadth-first-search:\r\n  1. Begin with the traits declared in our current program, which we have via existing registries.\r\n  2. Look at NgModules we've seen imported, and expand their imports and exports.\r\n      a. We will discover components that can be imported via that NgModule.\r\n      b. We will discover additional NgModules that exist, and recurse into them.\r\n\r\nAs we conduct this BFS, we will discover all NgModules anywhere in the current dependency graph, as well as *all* exports of those NgModules. Along the way, we build several indices, which nicely solves the problem of knowing what NgModule exports a given pipe. In addition, this simultaneously solves the issue of being able to recommend all known re-exports.\r\n\r\n(This also sets up the next feature I intend to implement: importing components and pipes from outside the current compilation unit. For example, if someone is using `NgIf`, we will index `CommonModule`, and be able to suggest imports like `DatePipe`. This is not yet implemented though.)\r\n\r\n### refactor(language-service): Improve the quick fix auto-import tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the auto-import tests are very difficult to debug, because the `expect`ations are buried several function calls deep, and also because the multi-line replacements are hard to deal with. The auto-import tests now use a different approach, which can be easily debugged from the failure message. In addition, several new tests have been added to cover more cases.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48354","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(language-service): Allow auto-imports of a pipe via quick fix when its selector is used.\" (#48354)"},{"Id":"1475207689","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-04T21:33:16","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"48353","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): make sure selectors inside container queries are correctly scoped","State":"open","Body":"resolves #48264\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Here's an example benchmark for using esbuild to pretty-print a single large minified CSS file and JS file:\n\n    | Test case      | Previous release | This release       |\n    |----------------|------------------|--------------------|\n    | 4.8mb CSS file | 19ms             | 11ms (1.7x faster) |\n    | 5.8mb JS file  | 36ms             | 32ms (1.1x faster) |\n\n    The performance improvements were very straightforward:\n\n    -   Identifiers were being scanned using a generic character advancement function instead of using custom inline code. Advancing past each character involved UTF-8 decoding as well as updating multiple member variables. This was sped up using loop that skips UTF-8 decoding entirely and that only updates member variables once at the end. This is faster because identifiers are plain ASCII in the vast majority of cases, so Unicode decoding is almost always unnecessary.\n\n    -   CSS identifiers and CSS strings were still being printed one character at a time. Apparently I forgot to move this part of esbuild's CSS infrastructure beyond the proof-of-concept stage. These were both very obvious in the profiler, so I think maybe I have just never profiled esbuild's CSS printing before?\n\n    -   There was unnecessary work being done that was related to source maps when source map output was disabled. I likely haven't observed this before because esbuild's benchmarks always have source maps enabled. This work is now disabled when it's not going to be used.\n\n    I definitely should have caught these performance issues earlier. Better late than never I suppose.\n\n### [`v0.15.17`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01517)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.16...v0.15.17)\n\n-   Search for missing source map code on the file system ([#&#8203;2711](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2711))\n\n    [Source maps](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html) are JSON files that map from compiled code back to the original code. They provide the original source code using two arrays: `sources` (required) and `sourcesContent` (optional). When bundling is enabled, esbuild is able to bundle code with source maps that was compiled by other tools (e.g. with Webpack) and emit source maps that map all the way back to the original code (e.g. before Webpack compiled it).\n\n    Previously if the input source maps omitted the optional `sourcesContent` array, esbuild would use `null` for the source content in the source map that it generates (since the source content isn't available). However, sometimes the original source code is actually still present on the file system. With this release, esbuild will now try to find the original source code using the path in the `sources` array and will use that instead of `null` if it was found.\n\n-   Fix parsing bug with TypeScript `infer` and `extends` ([#&#8203;2712](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2712))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild incorrectly failed to parse valid TypeScript code that nests `extends` inside `infer` inside `extends`, such as in the example below:\n\n    ```ts\n    type A<T> = {};\n    type B = {} extends infer T extends {} ? A<T> : never;\n    ```\n\n    TypeScript code that does this should now be parsed correctly.\n\n-   Use `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` if available ([#&#8203;1036](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/1036), [#&#8203;1900](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/1900))\n\n    Currently the WebAssembly version of esbuild uses `fetch` to download `esbuild.wasm` and then `WebAssembly.instantiate` to compile it. There is a newer API called `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` that both downloads and compiles at the same time, which can be a performance improvement if both downloading and compiling are slow. With this release, esbuild now attempts to use `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` and falls back to the original approach if that fails.\n\n    The implementation for this builds on a PR by [@&#8203;lbwa](https://togithub.com/lbwa).\n\n-   Preserve Webpack comments inside constructor calls ([#&#8203;2439](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2439))\n\n    This improves the use of esbuild as a faster TypeScript-to-JavaScript frontend for Webpack, which has special [magic comments](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments) inside `new Worker()` expressions that affect Webpack's behavior.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.29.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.29.0)\n\n[Compare

For example you install `react` and `react-dom` into the workspace, you add `\"jsx\": \"react-jsx\"` to your tsconfig, you wrap your react component in a web component, you import your web component into your project app, you add CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA to the app.module.ts, and you use the webcomponent markup inside of the template of the component of your choosing. (I also added the line `\"include\": [\"./src/**/*.ts\", \"./src/**/*.js\", \"./src/**/*.tsx\", \"./src/**/*.jsx\"],` to the tsconfig.)\r\n\r\nI am now trying to set up building the library.

The bug (already solved in\r\nv16 of Safari)- is very subtle, hard to re-reproduce but basically\r\nvariable scope tracking is broken. This bug is triggered by additional\r\nparenthesis in the initializer expression. See:\r\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236843.\r\n\r\nThe TypeScript compiler may generate such additional parenthesis when\r\nit tries to adjust the `this` context when invoking methods, such as for\r\ndefining animations in the `ecmp` definition.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24355#issuecomment-1333477033\r\n\r\nTo ensure Angular applications are not subject to this bug when\r\ntargeting Safari <=v15. v15 Safari, both for iOS and Mac is still part of\r\nthe default CLI browserslist with `last 2 Safari majors` (at time of\r\nwriting).\r\n\r\nNote that it is important that the Babel plugin properly handles the\r\ndownleveling of static block-defined members. TypeScript will transform\r\nstatic fields, like `static ecmp` into `static { this.ecmp = X }` when\r\n`useDefineForClassFields = false` (which is the case for CLI apps). The\r\nclass properties plugin from Babel seems to handle this in an acceptable\r\nway. Unlike actual static fields, Babel will not use helpers like\r\n`defineProperty` for such extracted static blocks though. e.g.\r\n\r\nSee repro: https://gist.github.com/devversion/dec0dea26e348c509921bf62079b60be\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Test {\r\n  x = true;\r\n\r\n  static b = true;\r\n  static {\r\n    this.a = true;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// into\r\n\r\nclass X {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    _defineProperty(this, \"x\", true);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n_defineProperty(X, \"b\", true);\r\nX.a = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nnote that in practice TypeScript with `useDefineForClassFields = false`\r\nwill put non-static members into the constructor as normal assignments\r\nregardless- so there would be no change by the Babel plugin.\r\n\r\nFixes #24355 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24357","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downlevel class properties when targeting Safari <=v15\" (#24357)"},{"Id":"1471443706","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-02T09:04:51","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"24358","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): add missing import for functional interceptor spec","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Java paths in particular run into this in google3, where users might want to generate `foo/bar/baz.ts`, `java/com/corp/foo/bar/baz.java`, and `javatests/com/corp/foo/bar/baz.java`.\r\n\r\nSchematics currently restricts users to the current directory, so this use case doesn't work intuitively.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'm not sure about the proper solution to this problem. I do agree with the current behavior that schematics _should_ be scoped to a particular directory and prevent accesses outside of that, both for security and usability reasons. That said, I think this monorepo issue is a very real problem, so it would be nice to have some kind of support for it.\r\n\r\nSome strawman ideas for a solution:\r\n* Let schematics \"`cd`\" into a different directory and use that as the root. So even if it's run in `foo/bar/`, it could use `../../` as its root and access the whole monorepo.\r\n* Let schematics declare the root directory in their schema relative to the project root: `{ \"root\": \"../../\" }`.\r\n* Prompt users to give access to directories outside the default one in a permissions model. This is probably the safest but also the most annoying to use.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nBest alternative is to run the schematic in the monorepo root, but this can be awkward for users who `cd` in to their particular project directory.\r\n\r\nI think you can also edit external files via a `Task`, but then you're throwing away a lot of the ergonomics of schematics, so that's not a great escape hatch. I guess you could schedule a `Task` which reruns the schematic in a different directory?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24362","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Schematics: Edit files in different places of monorepo\" (#24362)"},{"Id":"1471849659","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-01T19:40:34","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"24360","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Schematics CLI] Numeric strings in schematics options","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFrom http://b/196605664.\r\n\r\nApparently you can't pass in a numeric value into a string argument in schematics.

The app will typically crash on a \"missing\" code block because it cannot find said block.  However, the block DOES exist, but may have just been added amongst other changes.  The workaround is to modify the block again (by adding a comment or console.log), forcing a fresh reload.  Invariably, this will rectify the issue.\r\nWe upgraded from v11 to v14 a few months ago and it is believed the issue has been introduced since then.  At that time, however, we started restructuring the app by using modules and lazy loading, in case that's relevant somehow.\r\nI have been using Angular for many years and have not encountered this issue before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nThe error in the screenshot below was produced by adding a new method to this demo repo [https://github.com/mattbodman/reload-issue](https://github.com/mattbodman/reload-issue)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1167\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1994501/205180260-9144948a-bb5d-4954-a161-5bdd576ded75.png\">\r\n\r\nWhilst the screenshot shows the project successfully compiling after the error, our project frequently does not.

I was using 14.2.2.\n\n### Description\n\nSome components have \"touch targets\" that are positioned absolutely and extend past the borders of the component itself. When one of these components is near the edge of a scrollable container, it can cause the scrollbar to appear when it shouldn't. The work-around is easy enough - just add padding, but besides throwing off your design, it can be difficult and frustrating trying to figure out why the scrollbar is appearing.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a scrollable div\r\n2. Place a button at the bottom or right side of the div without it extending past the scrollable area.\r\n3. Notice a scrollbar appears anyway because an element with the class `mat-mdc-button-touch-target` is absolutely positioned and extends past the borders of the button.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe scrollbar should not appear. The touch target should not extend past the edges of the button or should be clipped to stay within scrollable area.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA scrollbar appears because an absolutely positioned element is overlapping the scrollable element's border.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26176","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/button): Components with absolutely positioned touch targets (like mat-button) can cause scrollbar to appear.\" (#26176)"},{"Id":"1474955540","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-04T16:14:45","Actor":"RobinKamps","Number":"26175","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(form field/ input / select / textarea / autocomplete): hover and cursor not implementing material design spec","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\ncursors are wrong - e.g. must be cursor: text on the whole fields - not just the input.\r\nhover highlight is also wrong - in v15 hover on the subscript/hint/error is highlighting the field, but it should not.\r\n\r\n![cursor-hover1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27373333/205502094-e77b2f51-501f-48de-bdd8-a4e9cb913852.gif)\r\n\r\n![cursor-hover2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27373333/205502104-73a6faee-bc9e-467c-9b74-c4a99f806c3e.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. e.g. https://material.angular.io/components/input/overview and hover over the edges/underneath the field\r\n2. compare to https://m2.material.io/components/text-fields\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ncursors and hover should match material design specs\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nnot matching the material design spec\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.1\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26175","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(form field/ input / select / textarea / autocomplete): hover and cursor not implementing material design spec\" (#26175)"},{"Id":"1474579752","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-04T08:02:32","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26174","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/listbox): set initial focus to selected option","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the listbox was setting the initial focus on a deselected option when a selected one was available.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this fix is a bit more convoluted than it needs to be.

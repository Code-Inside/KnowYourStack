My understanding of the web test runner is, that you provide a plugin which wraps the framework of your choice. The plugin takes care of building and testing your code specific to your framework and then reports the results to the web test runner. \r\n\r\nI tried the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in a monorepo and I really like it so far, but I was confused that when provided a `web-test-runner.config.mjs` it was ignored.

This mode allows TypeScript to read and use any package.json `exports` and `imports` fields found within packages including the Angular workspace. Unlike the `node16` option value, this value does not require the use of file extensions for each import and does not require modification of all existing application code to use. The TypeScript language service also benefits from this option by allowing import auto-discovery to leverage any `exports` defined for a package. This is particularly useful for packages such as `@angular/material` which makes extensive use of secondary package exports.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding this resolution mode can be found here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27266","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): use TypeScript bundler module resolution for new projects\" (#27266)"},{"Id":"2184407531","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-13T18:00:00","Actor":"LorinRenodeyn","Number":"27272","RawContent":null,"Title":"browser-esbuild messes up resolution of scss imports, adding tildes","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n17.1.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen switching from `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild`, the ng-serve command throws errors on the scss imports.

The console errors refer to the scss base file in /application/src/styles.scss, but the logs don't correspond to the file contents. The imported packages are internal npm packages used by the client and names have been redacted.\r\n\r\nstyles.scss contents:\r\n```SCSS\r\n@import '@component-lib/styles/reset';\r\n@import

`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` config works fine and without errors, both in terminal and browser console.The tildes reported by the error logs are _not_ present in the codebase.\r\n\r\nThis

Since IE is no longer supported, the `animate` function should be available in [all supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_element_animate), so it looks like we can drop the `CssKeyframesDriver` in favor of `WebAnimationsDriver`.\r\n\r\nThe biggest benefit that we'd have is less code in app bundles, the way those classes are referenced is non-tree-shakable ([see here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-browser/animations/src/providers.ts#L63-L66)): both classes would be retained in an app bundle when the `BrowserAnimationsModule` is used. That'd probably save a few KB.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to do that, it'd be great to implement and land the tooling to measure the bundle size and retained symbols first, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44437. In this case we'd be able to measure the impact of this change.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44520","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Animations: consider dropping CssKeyframesDriver in favor of WebAnimationsDriver\" (#44520)"},{"Id":"1082773890","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-17T00:57:24","Actor":"atscott","Number":"44519","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): Allow symbol keys for `Route` `data` and `resolve` prop…","State":"open","Body":"…erties\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the ability to use a symbol as the key for the `data` and `resolve` objects\r\nin a `Route` config.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44519","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): Allow symbol keys for `Route` `data` and `resolve` prop…\" (#44519)"},{"Id":"1082724418","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-16T23:18:47","Actor":"atscott","Number":"44518","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add breaking changes note to 13.0 release","State":"open","Body":"A breaking change in v13 was identified post-release and needs to be noted\r\nin the breaking changes section to ensure developers are aware of it\r\nwhen upgrading.\r\n\r\nResolves #44383\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44518","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: Add breaking changes note to 13.0 release\" (#44518)"},{"Id":"1081895508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-16T22:32:59","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"44501","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency firebase-tools to v10 - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [firebase-tools](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | [`^9.0.0` -> `^10.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/9.22.0/10.0.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/firebase-tools/10.0.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/firebase-tools/10.0.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/firebase-tools/10.0.0/compatibility-slim/9.22.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/firebase-tools/10.0.0/confidence-slim/9.22.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools</summary>\n\n### [`v10.0.0`](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/v10.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v9.23.2...v10.0.0)\n\n-   **BREAKING** Drops support for running the CLI on Node 10.\n-   **BREAKING** Replaces all usages of `-y`, `--yes`, or `--confirm` with `-f` and `--force`.\n-   **BREAKING** Function deploys upload source to the deployed region instead of us-central1.\n-   Requires firebase-functions >= 3.13.1 in Functions emulator to include bug fixes ([#&#8203;3851](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/3851)).\n-   Updates default functions runtime to Node.js 16.\n\n### [`v9.23.2`](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/v9.23.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v9.23.1...v9.23.2)\n\n-   Fixes issue when installing a Firebase Extension where secrets would be created before validation.\n-   Fixes issue with filtering on a specific storage bucket using functions in the emulator.

Just in case it got dropped there because it is NOT a vulnerability disclosure, I am opening this issue. No intention to spam, feel free to close this issue if you have discussed this internally already and dismissed the idea.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to give your project *free* MFA hardware tokens from Google and GitHub, for use by your maintainers.  We'd especially like to give them to any of your maintainers who aren't already using any.  Our goal is to help improve the security of open source software (OSS)/Free Software projects.  For example, these tokens can counter attacks that release source code updates and/or packages using stolen passwords.\r\n\r\nBy **2021-12-20** and preferably much sooner, please let me know:\r\n\r\n1. If you want any tokens, and if so...\r\n2. How many Titan tokens from Google (up to 5)\r\n3. How many Yubikey tokens from GitHub (up to 5)\r\n4. The *private* email address to send codes to (this email must *not* go to the public, as these are use-once codes that can be used to get the tokens)\r\n5. If you could use more, how many more.\r\n\r\nWe would send you coupon codes and validation codes to the private email address.  You would then distribute those codes to the maintainers you choose.  The recipients would use the coupon codes and validation codes to \"buy\" the tokens from the Google Store and/or GitHub Shop, who would ship the tokens directly to recipients.  These codes are use-once, so make sure you can keep the codes private until they're used by the intended person.\r\n\r\n**Important**: The Google coupon codes **must be used by 2021-12-31** on the Google Store or they expire.\r\n\r\nHow can you trust us? You don't need to. You would get the MFA tokens from Google and GitHub; we're simply offering codes to make them no-cost.  We'll provide some documentation on how to use them, but you don't need to use our documents.\r\n\r\nTo qualify, each token recipient must:\r\n\r\n1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS) project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on (the dependency may be indirect).\r\n2. Try to use an MFA token once they receive the token.  We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.\r\n3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).\r\n4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).\r\n\r\nWe also need each project that receives coupon codes and/or validation codes\r\nto tell us these numbers (preferably within 30 days of getting the codes):\r\n\r\n1. How many tokens did you distribute from just Google? From just GitHub?\r\n2. How many people received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub?  From both?\r\n3. How many people didn’t have hardware tokens they used for OSS who received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?\r\n\r\nWe ask for this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success. We don't need nor want the names of any individuals participating. It's fine to ask the people who got the codes for that information and provide a best-effort summary.\r\n\r\nThe MFA tokens are shipped from the US.  They can be shipped internationally, but there are various limitations on where each can be shipped.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we can't ship somewhere if that is forbidden (sanctioned) under US law.  So at this time we are unable to ship to individuals in China, Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.  See the Google and GitHub sites for more shipping information.  [More sanction information is available](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).\r\n\r\nFor more information including how-tos and other setup information can be found at the [\"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution Project\" site](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project).\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease

esbuild's handling of `default` exports and the `__esModule` marker ([#&#8203;532](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/532), [#&#8203;1591](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1591), [#&#8203;1719](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1719))\n\n    This change requires some background for context. Here's the history to the best of my understanding:\n\n    When the ECMAScript module `import`/`export` syntax was being developed, the CommonJS module format (used in Node.js) was already widely in use. Because of this the export name called `default` was given special a syntax. Instead of writing `import { default as foo } from 'bar'` you can just write `import foo from 'bar'`. The idea was that when ECMAScript modules (a.k.a. ES modules) were introduced, you could import existing CommonJS modules using the new import syntax for compatibility. Since CommonJS module exports are dynamic while ES module exports are static, it's not generally possible to determine a CommonJS module's export names at module instantiation time since the code hasn't been evaluated yet. So the value of `module.exports` is just exported as the `default` export and the special `default` import syntax gives you easy access to `module.exports` (i.e. `const foo = require('bar')` is the same as `import foo from 'bar'`).\n\n    However, it took a while for ES module syntax to be supported natively by JavaScript runtimes, and people still wanted to start using ES module syntax in the meantime. The [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) JavaScript compiler let you do this. You could transform each ES module file into a CommonJS module file that behaved the same. However, this transformation has a problem: emulating the `import` syntax accurately as described above means that `export default 0` and `import foo from 'bar'` will no longer line up when transformed to CommonJS. The code `export default 0` turns into `module.exports.default = 0` and the code `import foo from 'bar'` turns into `const foo = require('bar')`, meaning `foo` is `0` before the transformation but `foo` is `{ default: 0 }` after the transformation.\n\n    To fix this, Babel sets the property `__esModule` to true as a signal to itself when it converts an ES module to a CommonJS module. Then, when importing a `default` export, it can know to use the value of `module.exports.default` instead of `module.exports` to make sure the behavior of the CommonJS modules correctly matches the behavior of the original ES modules. This fix has been widely adopted across the ecosystem and has made it into other tools such as TypeScript and even esbuild.\n\n    However, when Node.js finally released their ES module implementation, they went with the original implementation where the `default` export is always `module.exports`, which broke compatibility with the existing ecosystem of ES modules that had been cross-compiled into CommonJS modules by Babel. You now have to either add or remove an additional `.default` property depending on whether your code needs to run in a Node environment or in a Babel environment, which created an interoperability headache. In addition, JavaScript tools such as esbuild now need to guess whether you want Node-style or Babel-style `default` imports. There's no way for a tool to know with certainty which one a given file is expecting and if your tool guesses wrong, your code will break.\n\n    This release changes esbuild's heuristics around `default` exports and the `__esModule` marker to attempt to improve compatibility with Webpack and Node, which is what most packages are tuned for. The behavior changes are as follows:\n\n    Old behavior:\n\n    -   If an `import` statement is used to load a CommonJS file and a) `module.exports` is an object, b) `module.exports.__esModule` is truthy, and c) the property `default` exists in `module.exports`, then esbuild would set the `default` export to `module.exports.default` (like Babel). Otherwise the `default` export was set to `module.exports` (like Node).\n\n    -   If a `require` call is used to load an ES module file, the returned module namespace object had the `__esModule` property set to true. This behaved as if the ES module had been converted to CommonJS via  a Babel-compatible transformation.\n\n    -   The `__esModule` marker could inconsistently appear on module namespace objects (i.e. `import * as`) when writing pure ESM code. Specifically, if a module namespace object was materialized then the `__esModule` marker was present, but if it was optimized away then the `__esModule` marker was absent.\n\n    -   It was not allowed to create an ES module export named `__esModule`. This avoided generating code that might break due to the inconsistency mentioned above, and also avoided issues with duplicate definitions of `__esModule`.\n\n    New behavior:\n\n    -   If an `import` statement is used to load a CommonJS file and a) `module.exports` is an object, b) `module.exports.__esModule` is truthy, and c) the file name does not end in either `.mjs` or `.mts` and the `package.json` file does not contain `\"type\": \"module\"`, then esbuild will set the `default` export to `module.exports.default` (like Babel). Otherwise the `default` export is set to `module.exports` (like Node).\n\n        Note that this means the `default` export may now be undefined in situations where it previously wasn't undefined. This matches Webpack's behavior so it should hopefully be more compatible.\n\n        Also note that this means import behavior now depends on the file extension and on the contents of `package.json`. This also matches Webpack's behavior to hopefully improve compatibility.\n\n    -   If a `require` call is used to load an ES module file, the returned module namespace object has the `__esModule` property set to `true`. This behaves as if the ES module had been converted to CommonJS via  a Babel-compatible transformation.\n\n    -   If an `import` statement or `import()` expression is used to load an ES module, the `__esModule` marker should now never be present on the module namespace object. This frees up the `__esModule` export name for use with ES modules.\n\n    -   It's now allowed to use `__esModule` as a normal export name in an ES module. This property will be accessible to other ES modules but will not be accessible to code that loads the ES module using `require`, where they will observe the property set to `true` instead.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

And having it included would be really nice.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, my proposal would be to expose a boolean input `matMultiSort` flag and refactor `MatSort` and `MatSortHeader` so that `MatSort` will hold the `MatSortable`'s state, and expose `isActive(id: string) => boolean` and `getNextDirection(id: string) => SortDirection` that will be used instead of directly accessing `active` and `direction`.\r\n\r\n`MatSort` will hold a `sortState: Map<string, Sort>` that can be used to query its state whenever a sort event occurs. \r\n  \r\nThis change should avoid most (if not all) compatibility issues. But it would be best if we can deprecate the current `sortChanged: EventEmitter<Sort>` for one that emits `Sort[]` instead, this way we wont need to expose `sortState` (although most of the usage examples for this API expect one to access its internal state anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Known issues\r\nThis change of sorting behavior will require a review of the included sorting method for `MatTableDataSource`, that was designed around a single column sort. \r\nHaving multiple possible sortable columns will require a better strategy on sorting (weighting by index position?).\r\nOr, whenever the MatTableDataSource default implementation is used, multi-sorting could be disabled?\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe want to be able to enable sorting based on multiple columns at a time.\r\n\r\nThis should be done with minimal changes.\r\n\r\nProposed usage:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Adding matSortMultiple will enable multi-sorting -->\r\n<table mat-table matSort matSortMultiple matSortActive=\"position\" matSortDirection=\"asc\" [dataSource]=\"dataSource\">\r\n    <ng-container matColumnDef=\"name\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header sortActionDescription=\"Sort by name\">\r\n      Name\r\n    </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.name}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-container matColumnDef=\"symbol\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header sortActionDescription=\"Sort by symbol\">\r\n      Symbol\r\n    </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.symbol}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@ViewChild(MatSort) matSort: MatSort;\r\n\r\nngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    matSort.sortChanged.pipe(map(() => Array.from(matSort.sortstate.values()))\r\n    .subscribe((sorts: Sort[])=> {\r\n        // do something with the Sort[] \r\n    });\r\n}\r\n``` ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24102","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatSort): Enable multi-sorting capability on current Interface\" (#24102)"},{"Id":"1079828451","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-14T14:29:37","Actor":"NeliaRudyk","Number":"24101","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(autocomplete): Highlight the typed text in autocomplete in xCode iPhone simulator safari","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHighlight the typed text in autocomplete in xCode iPhone simulator iPhone 13 iOS 15.2 safari.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Angular 18.2.8 having CSS-Rules like\n\n```css\n/*.all rules before a good */\n\n.foo:not(\n  .bla) {\n    background-color: green;\n}\n\n/* all rules after are broken */\n\n```\nbreaks Dev-Mode when running with Webpack (the new ES-Build driven Dev-Mode is unaffected). \n\nLooking at the generated CSS shows that the resulting CSS is broken:\n\n```css\n.foo[_ngcontent-ng-c2967627618]:not( {\n    background-color: green;\n}\n\n.my-style[_ngcontent-ng-c2967627618] {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nIt should be (eg generated when running with

In the example provided here the error indicates that the component which is used for routing is missing the provider but it's actually one of its child components. (I think the error, or the component in the error message, always falls back to any routed component and won't be shown in any child component)\n\nInstead of ` ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeRoutedComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]` I would have expected ` ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeChildComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]`\n\nThere might be technical reasons why this is the case but in my opinion this is wrong and it's at least highly confusing...\n\nPS: I believe this should already be checked at build time but this is a different story.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/thecp/NullInjector-Message-Reproduction\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\ncore.mjs:7195 ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeRoutedComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for _DatePipe!\n    at NullInjector.get (core.mjs:1636:21)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at ChainedInjector.get (core.mjs:5289:32)\n    at lookupTokenUsingModuleInjector (core.mjs:5632:31)\n    at getOrCreateInjectable (core.mjs:5678:10)\n    at ɵɵdirectiveInject (core.mjs:11586:17)\n    at ɵɵinject (core.mjs:1102:40)\n    at inject (core.mjs:1187:10)\nhandleError\t@\tcore.mjs:7195\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.10\n@angular/cli                    18.2.10\n@schematics/angular             18.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAlso tested this with the newest next Version but the problem persists.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NullInjectorError shows wrong component with missing provider\" (#58391)"},{"Id":"2616417813","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-28T12:58:44","Actor":"dushyanthb27","Number":"58379","RawContent":null,"Title":"Component with  Encapsulation as ShadowDom leaking the styles to global styles when SSR is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen SSR is enabled for the project and\nWhen a component hierarchy is created such that CompA render CompB and CompB render CompC, \nAnd CompB has the encapsulation as ShadowDom, the CompB's styles are leaking out globally and all the elements getting the styles of CompB.\n\nComponent calling hierarchy:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b0cfb5-2a68-4339-a312-4a8ee8bf1beb)\n\nRender:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d04893b6-5c84-45fb-b54f-c252c1e6c840)\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/dushyanthb27/ViewEncapsulationIssue.git\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n Angular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 20.11.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: undefined\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.10 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.10 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.10 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          18.2.10 (cli-only)\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58379","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component with  Encapsulation as ShadowDom leaking the styles to global styles when SSR is enabled\" (#58379)"},{"Id":"2618233433","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-28T12:06:49","Actor":"mwaibel-go","Number":"58389","RawContent":null,"Title":"Injector Tree diagrams reset on every change detection","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a bug report or a feature request?\n\n- [x] Bug Report\n- [ ] Feature Request\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue [Bug Report only]\n\n1.

These services offer limited flexibility, especially for SSR-focused applications where managing tags like `<link>` or dynamic metadata updates is crucial. Currently, <ins>**there is no clean way to create `<link>` tags in SSR context**</ins> that are hydrated, defined at the component level, and integrated with Angular’s lifecycle. A new, declarative component e.g. `<ng-head>` would enhance the developer experience by providing a more intuitive and comprehensive way to handle metadata and head elements in an Angular project.\n\nWhile it is possible to create a custom library to address this problem, it feels like this functionality should be available out of the box in Angular. Features like adding `<link>` tags to the header or automatically handling title and meta tags (adding and removing them when a component is created or destroyed) should not require writing a custom service to manage. Having these capabilities natively would greatly enhance Angular’s usability in SSR contexts and make metadata management simpler and more consistent.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```html\n<ng-head>\n  <title>Example</title>\n  <meta name=\"description\" [attr.content]=\"example$ | async\" /> <!-- with observables -->\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" [attr.href]=\"example()\" /> <!-- or with signals -->\n</ng-head>\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile a new service for head management supporting [all elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head#see_also) could be an option, I personally don’t find this approach ideal.\n\n\n### Current approaches \nCurrently, I'm aware of two indirect approaches to achieve this, both of which feel very developer-unfriendly:\n\n1. **Creating a Service**: A custom service can be created that listens to `RouterEvents`, loading metadata from the `data` property on the route and handling automatic removal. This approach requires custom event handling and can become complex to maintain.\n   \n2. **Managing Metadata in Each Component**: Another method is to add and remove meta tags directly within each component, using `ngOnInit` to add tags and `ngOnDestroy` to remove them. This requires repetitive code in each component and increases the risk of metadata inconsistencies.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Native Component for Dynamic Metadata in Angular – Essential for SSR in SEO context\" (#58377)"},{"Id":"2615671384","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T08:53:46","Actor":"vinuvatassery","Number":"58376","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content security policy Issue for ZAP scan with -unsafe-inline' option","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-browser\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn my application, I am configuring the Content Security Policy for script-src and style-src.

With the prior implementation, a change of the `request` will queue the effect, but the state remains unchanged until the effect actually runs. For a brief period, the resource is in a state where the request has changed, but the state has yet to update.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic if we want to use resources in certain contexts where we care about the state of the resource in a synchronous way. For example, an async validator backed by a resource might be checked after an update:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalue.set(123);\r\n\r\nif (validator.value()) {\r\n  // value is still valid, even though the resource is dirty and will soon flip\r\n  // to loading state (returning value(): undefined) while revalidating.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo address this timing concern, `linkedSignal()` is used within the `resource()` now to to synchronously transition the state in response to the request changing. This ensures any followup reads see a consistent view of the resource regardless of whether the effect has run.\r\n\r\nThis also addresses a race condition where `.set()` behaves differently on a `resource()` depending on whether or not the effect has run.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58372","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): port resource() to linkedSignal()\" (#58372)"},{"Id":"2615152859","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T21:35:28","Actor":"szeinedd-nrel","Number":"58371","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing documentation for FormControl","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe documentation page for `FormControl` is essentially blank.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControl\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nSomething akin to https://v17.angular.io/api/forms/FormControl","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58371","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing documentation for FormControl\" (#58371)"},{"Id":"2614890730","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T18:57:41","Actor":"mcalmus","Number":"58370","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signals require previously-unnecessary type checking.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nSignals require previously-unnecessary type checking.\n\nold:\n```\n@Input()\nfoo?: { bar: string };\n```\ntemplate:\n```\n@if (foo) {\n  {{ foo.bar }}\n}\n```\nnew:\n```\nreadonly foo = input<{ bar: string }>();\n\n@if (foo()) {\n  {{ foo().bar }}\n}\n```\n`error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.`\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58370","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signals require previously-unnecessary type checking.\" (#58370)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2617537207","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-28T21:04:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28724","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This allowed to propagate values via injection token retrieved in `server.ts` to the application. \n\nNot knowing if there is a better approach, those values usually are:\n- configurations that must be available also in the angular application. Those values are always present during SSR and sometimes are needed also on the browser, so TransferState is needed to propagate them\n  - [app.config.ts](https://github.com/riccardoperra/angular-ssr-repro/blob/aa7b0c50698d981d52446a3043a594d6b69ea21b/18-ssr/src/app/app.config.ts#L16) : example of a token always valuated in both ssr and browser\n- server only object that allow to update the request data (e.g. update response headers / status code) / redirect\n  - Main use cases are for example the possibility to change the page status to 404 if the requested resource does not exist, preserving navigation.\n- static values that must be fetched only on server bootstrap and reused across all requests.\n\nAn important use case is that those value **could be used** into other application-level providers, in order to configurate them based on the request providers.\n\nWith the new `AngularAppEngine` in v19, I saw from @JeanMeche reproduction that you can pass custom values into the `requestContext` parameter when you render the app ([server.ts](https://github.com/JeanMeche/ssr-v19/blob/eef03da8ab1d2836b135e32f041b62fdb698a9f5/server.ts#L39)), however I have noticed some unusual behaviors that make me think I can't do the same things:\n\n- Those values are not always valuated. It seems that there is a case (the first request?) where those values are null.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ec5320-9ed8-4c1c-9184-1d49edbc352f)\n\nLike the screenshot above, (reproducible with `npm run start` into the v19-ssr folder), after the server, the log just show that the first request invoke 2 time the application bootstrap: the first time values in request context (inject via `REQUEST_CONTEXT` token) are null, the second one are valuated. This is critical since the first time an error is thrown, the application breaks.\n\n- Cannot modify request headers/status: with the new native `Response` object, it seems that we are not allowed anymore to update it imperatively into the angular application.

In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"},{"Id":"2615017503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T20:11:50","Actor":"FlorinCiocirlan","Number":"29926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in function comment","State":"open","Body":"There is a typo in file _**[components](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main)/[src](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src)/[cdk](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk)/[schematics](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics)/[update-tool](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics/update-tool)/index.ts**_\n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_form_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */\n\nshould be \n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_from_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typo in function comment\" (#29926)"},{"Id":"2614399233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T15:16:29","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29925","RawContent":null,"Title":"merge material.angular.io repo","State":"open","Body":"Used git-filter-repo to rewrite history, so commits appear to have always been beneath the `material.angular.io` folder.\r\n\r\nFollows https://blog.aspect.build/otherrepo-to-monorepo\r\n\r\nNote, this MUST be a merge commit so care should be taken when merging to prevent squashing the history and losing the git blame layer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29925","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"merge material.angular.io repo\" (#29925)"},{"Id":"2613213774","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T06:31:01","Actor":"caleniuc","Number":"29923","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAnchor): aria-disabled not applied with disabledInteractive","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`MAT_ANCHOR_HOST` applies `aria-disabled` differently than `MAT_BUTTON_HOST`.

Notice `aria-disabled` is not applied\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`<a>` button has `aria-disabled` applied when `disabledInteractive` is `true`, like on `<button>`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`<a>` button does not have `aria-disabled` applied when `disabledInteractive` is `true`\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: v18, v19.0.0-next.2\n- CDK/Material: v18, v19.0.0-next.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29923","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatAnchor): aria-disabled not applied with disabledInteractive\" (#29923)"},{"Id":"2612636370","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T22:03:00","Actor":"anthonyrgreen","Number":"29921","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix header rerender bug which occurs when a table has two header rows…","State":"open","Body":"… updated simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposed solution to https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix header rerender bug which occurs when a table has two header rows…\" (#29921)"},{"Id":"2612866803","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T21:52:53","Actor":"anthonyrgreen","Number":"29922","RawContent":null,"Title":"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTl;dr: See a minimal repro with root-cause, explanation, and potential fix here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\nIf I create a mat-table, and give it multiple header rows like so:\n\n```\n    <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedHeaderColumns\"></tr>\n    <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>\n```\n\nThen, when I append a column to the inner values of both `displayedHeaderColumns` and `displayedHeaderColumns`, the cdk-table change-detection code renders the table into a 'dirty' state. The result of this is that, on the first dirty-check of the table, the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating all the `<th mat-header-cell>` elements and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\nThis phenomenon only occurs on the FIRST click post-column-add, and only if you include the 2nd (sub)header in your table definition, i.e. commenting out `<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>` mitigates the bug.\n\n# Possible root cause of the bug\n\nI think this is happening because Angular somehow rerenders the subheader as a result of dirty-checking the header, but does not update its internal records of the subheader's state in the process. Clicking the button causes the table to re-check its subheader's columns, at which point its differ discovers it hasn't officially added the newest column to the list (although it is already visually displaying the newest column).\n\nThis bug disappears if I modify `CdkTable._renderUpdatedColumns` in the following manner at [angular/components/src/cdk/table/table.ts:1087](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L1087):\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => \n    acc || !!def.getColumnsDiff();\n```\n\nFixed code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => {\n    const diff = def.getColumnsDiff();\n    return acc || !!diff;\n  };\n```\n    \nI think that the lazy computation of `def.getColumnsDiff()` is causing the subheader state not to get updated.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nThere is no exception. The error is that, when the user clicks their first button on a table header, all the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating each `<th mat-header-cell>` element and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"xokrrnnaegq.angular\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.4.0\",\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.6.4\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.8.29\",\n    \"hammerjs\": \"2.0.8\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"angular-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.5.4\",\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^18.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.10.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~7.0.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.8\",\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\n    \"karma\": \"~3.0.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.2\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"protractor\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.11.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.1.1\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers\" (#29922)"},{"Id":"2610922876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T09:00:28","Actor":"azimuthdeveloper","Number":"29919","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(treeview): Add guide on how to migrate from old treeview to new treeview","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the sudden deprecation of the various tree controllers, it would be nice if there were some kind of documentation on how to remove tree controller and migrate to the new way of doing things.

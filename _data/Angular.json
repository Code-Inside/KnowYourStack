Previously esbuild would pick the first matching `alias`, which would non-deterministically pick between one of the possible matches. This release fixes esbuild to always deterministically pick the longest possible match.\n\n-   Minify calls to some global primitive constructors ([#&#8203;2962](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2962))\n\n    With this release, esbuild's minifier now replaces calls to `Boolean`/`Number`/`String`/`BigInt` with equivalent shorter code when relevant:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(\n      Boolean(a ? (b | c) !== 0 : (c & d) !== 0),\n      Number(e ? '1' : '2'),\n      String(e ? '1' : '2'),\n      BigInt(e ? 1n : 2n),\n    )\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(Boolean(a?(b|c)!==0:(c&d)!==0),Number(e?\"1\":\"2\"),String(e?\"1\":\"2\"),BigInt(e?1n:2n));\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(!!(a?b|c:c&d),+(e?\"1\":\"2\"),e?\"1\":\"2\",e?1n:2n);\n    ```\n\n-   Adjust some feature compatibility tables for node ([#&#8203;2940](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2940))\n\n    This release makes the following adjustments to esbuild's internal feature compatibility tables for node, which tell esbuild which versions of node are known to support all aspects of that feature:\n\n    -   `class-private-brand-checks`: node v16.9+ => node v16.4+ (a decrease)\n    -   `hashbang`: node v12.0+ => node v12.5+ (an increase)\n    -   `optional-chain`: node v16.9+ => node v16.1+ (a decrease)\n    -   `template-literal`: node v4+ => node v10+ (an increase)\n\n    Each of these adjustments was identified by comparing against data from the `node-compat-table` package and was manually verified using old node executables downloaded from https://nodejs.org/download/release/.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier</summary>\n\n### [`v8.7.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-870-2023-03-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.6.0...v8.7.0)\n\n-   Added: \\[[@&#8203;typescript-eslint/block-spacing](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/block-spacing)].

In the MDC version (at version 15) of Angular Material, using `ng-container` within a button has an effect on the rendered DOM.\r\n\r\nThese expectations are based off of the Angular documentation, as well as my experience with previous versions of Angular Material. This issue was noticed while migrating an existing app to MDC.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Load this stackblitz in a Chromium based browser: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-1fvgpn?file=src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.ts\r\n2. Observe the difference between the disabled button and the enabled button. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the disabled button (no `ng-container`) and the enabled button (with `ng-container`) to have the same visual appearance and the same DOM structure, since `ng-container` was used to host the `NgIf` directive.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nUsing `NgIf` on an `ng-container` that contains a `MatIcon` within a `MatButton` is effecting the rendered DOM structure. The disabled button's innerHTML has the `mat-icon` rendered as a direct child of the `button`. The enabled button renders the `mat-icon` within the `span.mdc-button__label` element, as a \"grandchild\" of the `button`.\r\n\r\nThis difference in DOM structure leads to an inconsistent visual appearance that is challenging for library consumers to style away. I believe this breaks the expectations of the `NgContainer` API.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: ~15.2\r\n- CDK/Material: ~15.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chromium\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button): `ng-container` element is effecting the rendered DOM structure when used with `mat-icon` in `mat-button` template's innerHTML\" (#26714)"},{"Id":"1604164845","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-01T03:24:21","Actor":"pipeng119","Number":"26711","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): After the form control uses the required attribute, the error message cannot be merged with the custom validator attribute","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter using the required attribute in the form control, the object collecting error information will automatically be filled with a required attribute with a value of true, or if the custom form validator also returns the required attribute with a value of the other error information.

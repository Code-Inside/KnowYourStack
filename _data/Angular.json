Developers should never have to call `detectChanges` on a fixture manually. Instead of calling `detectChanges` after performing an action that updates state and requies a template refresh, developers should wait for change detection to run because the update needs to also have notified the scheduler. If this was not the case, the component would not work correctly in the application. Calling `detectChanges` to force an update could hide real bugs.\r\n\r\nThis commit also updates the zoneless tests to uses `ComponentFixture` instead of manually attaching to the `ApplicationRef` and rewriting a lot of the helpers (`getDebugNode`, `isStable` as a value, `whenStable` as a Promise).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54024","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): Update `ComponentFixture` behavior when using zoneless scheduler\" (#54024)"},{"Id":"2094928927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-22T23:02:54","Actor":"atscott","Number":"54023","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): race rAF and setTimeout in zoneless scheduler","State":"open","Body":"Update zoneless scheduler to run change detection after the first of either `requestAnimationFrame` or `setTimeout` callbacks execute.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54023","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): race rAF and setTimeout in zoneless scheduler\" (#54023)"},{"Id":"2094545343","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-22T18:55:59","Actor":"DerChris173","Number":"54022","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a way to set new default values to form controls","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nFor typical CRUD operations, it's often required to\r\n- reset the dialog to its initial state\r\n- query if a particular FormControl has a value that's different than the original one.\r\n\r\nThe defaultValue/reset() Feature is quite suitable for this. Unfortunately, there's no way to change the defaultValue, e.g. once the user performs a \"Save action\".\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose to enhance the Form API with the following methods:\r\n\r\n- `setDefaultValue(newDefaultValue: TValue)`: Updates the defaultValue of the FormControl to `newDefaultValue`. Calls to the reset() operation in particular will use this new defaultValue.\r\n- `setCurrentValuesAsDefault()`: Convenience method for `formControl.setDefaultValue(formControl.getRawValue())`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to develop and raise a PR for this feature.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAnother alternative would be to build entirely new FormControls if new default values are required.

Additionally we get CSRF Cookies (set-cookie headers) from our backend through this handshake calls.\r\nThis handshake calls are made within an APP_INITIALIZER function in our \"handshake\" module. So all the handshake stuff is made before our app starts the other functional calls to the backend are made. I try to show this in the reproduction code.\r\n\r\n**The Issue**\r\nThe handshake calls are working fine. We get the set-cookie header from the first handshake call in the response and the second handshake call sets the cookie in its request correctly (this is done in the initializer function). But right after this handshake calls are made, we are doing our first functional call to the backend through the AppComponent (or other services) and this request didn't have a cookies set.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the httpClient in the APP_INITIALIZER function has access to the cookie but the injection of httpClient in AppComponent do not have access to the cookies directly. Because the second handshake call from initializer function sets the cookies correctly. Just the call (after handshake calls) from AppComponent has no cookies set. It seems that it take some time (maybe one tick?) after the httpClient in AppComponent will send the cookies whit the requests.\r\n\r\nAND all this happends on mobile devices, **ONLY**. Tested with Chrome on Android, multiple devices.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe would expect, that the asynchronous APP_INITIALIZER function is executed first. Everything waits for it to finish and after that, each http call adds the cookies in its requests.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n- Checkout the reproduction code and run it with \"npm start\". \r\n- Connect your Android phone via USB and go in chrome on your PC/Mac to: chrome://inspect/#devices\r\n- Select \"Port forwarding\" and add 4200 -> localhost:4200 (so you can reach the devServer from your android cellphone)\r\n- Go to \"http://localhost:4200\" at your Android cellphone and open this tab in the inspect window on your PC/Mac\r\n- Remove all cookies for localhost (Application tab in inspect chrome window) and reload the page (at your android cellphone chrome browser) so you can see all initial network interactions in the developer console on the inspect chrome window on PC/Mac\r\n- You should see that the handshake call will contain a set-cookie header in response. BUT the \"backend/call\" has no cookie set in its request (like in my screenshot)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nScreenshots from Chrome Network Tab from my cellphone: \r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-22 um 11 58 09](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8022875/8ce7a374-81b7-46f8-8d69-8bdb915f8a4d)\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/tobiloeb/angular-cookie-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIt's hard to describe the scenario and the issue we have.

The scenario is straightforward: our app has a routing structure with a parent 'post' route and two children—one with an empty \"\" path using pathMatch: full, and another with the \"entity\" path. Navigating through these paths initially doesn't reveal any issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we reload the page while on the home page and then navigate to other paths, everything functions normally. Yet, if we reload the page while on the 'post entity' page, things appear fine initially. Still, upon navigating to the 'post list' and then back 'post entity' we encounter the following error:\r\n\r\n`ERROR RuntimeError: NG04002: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'post/post-entity.component.css.map'`\r\n(the error is shown into the terminal where the process is started)\r\n\r\nIn addition, I've implemented console logs of 'BEFORE SERVER RENDER!' for each commonEngine.render() execution in the server.ts file. After the bug occurs, we notice that the app is being rendered for each iteration, contrary to the expected default behavior of rendering just once.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

this bug was not present was\n\n17.0.9\n\n### Description\n\nWhen running `ng build --watch`, I get the following from time to time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir

reproduce the issue as it comes from time to time.\r\nBasically, I'm building the application with the watch flag and sometimes I get the aforementioned error.\r\nIt seems to occur after I fixed errors in the code impacting a lot of components and not when I just do some code update that work.\r\n\r\nStating the obvious, it seems that at some point, the path is generated and concatenate a full path with a full path instead of a full one with a relative one creating invalid path such as `C:\\Development\\dotnetcore\\HR-NET\\SFPD.Workflows\\wwwroot\\browser\\C:\\Development\\dotnetcore\\HR-NET\\SFPD.Workflows.App\\C:\\Development\\dotnetcore\\HR-NET\\SFPD.Workflows.App`\r\n\r\nI

Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows.\n\nThis bypass is similar to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, vite@2.9.17\n\n### Details\nSince `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. \n\nSee `picomatch`  usage, where `nocase` is defaulted to `false`: https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v5.1.0-beta.1/packages/vite/src/node/server/index.ts#L632\n\nBy requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. \n\n### PoC\n**Setup**\n1. Created vanilla Vite project using `npm create vite@latest` on a Standard Azure hosted Windows 10 instance. \n    - `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0`\n    - Publicly accessible for the time being here: http://20.12.242.81:5173/ \n2.

Using fixed strings doesn't work either as output hashing modifies the file name to a random value.\r\n\r\nFrankly, Angular does not provide a solution for building an app that is embedded as part of a larger website. The only supported use case is for the Angular index.html to be only served file and to be served from the root. I need to be able to simply add the Angular resources to an existing site. I understand it's not the most efficient/performant and that it breaks ng-serve, but that's the situation I have to contend with.

In special setups that don't yet have this index.html, this was ok since you could leave that configuration empty and it would build.

This required a few issues to be fixed:\r\n1. The badge was being sized with `width` and `height`. This is incorrect, because it prevents the badge from scaling with the text. I've resolved it while keeping the old behavior by introducing new tokens that target `min-width` and `min-height` while the old ones still target `width` and `height`.\r\n2. The badge was being positioned purely with `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`. This is problematic, because it anchors the badge to the specific point in the host, causing the content to grow inwards instead of outwards. I've fixed it by using the opposite dimensions to position the badge (e.g. `bottom: 100%` instead of `top: -20px`) and then using a negative margin to offset the badge from there. This approach also has the advantage of producing less CSS.\r\n3.

Among others, this library includes custom components which are to be opened inside a dialog. Here is what the module of such a component looks like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [MyComponent],\r\n  imports: [MatDialogModule],\r\n  export: [MyComponent],\r\n})\r\nexport class MyModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor applications which use that component in an NgModule, this works fine. However one of the applications is in the progress of migrating to standalone. After making the component standalone and adding `MyModule` to the `imports`, the unit tests involving the `MatDialog` service opening `MyComponent` failed. After investigation, I found out that the instance injected by the component constructor and the instance injected by `TestBed.inject()` are now two separate ones.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed with the Angular core team that this is by design, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53929.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `MatDialogModule` has `MatDialog` in its `providers`: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/b8cf1308571b29622422cd56f7f76b7bbc5ba5b1/src/material/dialog/module.ts#L34\r\n\r\nIMHO it should be removed from the providers, as the service is `providedIn: 'root'`.\r\n\r\nThe `MatSnackBar` has the same issue, there might be more affected services in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/json-derulo/ng17-dialog-issue\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run `ng test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere is only one instance of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro pass\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere are multiple instances of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro fails\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.10\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.10\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.10\r\n@angular/material               17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.10\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(multiple): services provided in root are also provided in NgModules\" (#28443)"},{"Id":"2086846127","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:34:21","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28442","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.1.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28442","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.1.0 release\" (#28442)"},{"Id":"2086844363","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:32:10","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28441","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0\" with changelog.\" (#28441)"},{"Id":"2086835084","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:26:15","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28440","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"release: cut the v17.1.0 release\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit b22362474a53b1b04981f6a8c4f02f6ff79ad1c1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28440","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"release: cut the v17.1.0 release\"\" (#28440)"},{"Id":"2086809964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:12:48","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28439","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0\" with changelog.\" (#28439)"},{"Id":"2086801730","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:04:44","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28438","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28438","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.6 release\" (#28438)"},{"Id":"2086799187","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-17T19:02:16","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.6\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28437","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.6\" with changelog.\" (#28437)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-01-23T03:30:02.7862736Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1555}

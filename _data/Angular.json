I'm trying a couple of fixes here:\r\n1. I noticed that it's usually the indexer tests that fail during flaky runs. These tests also happen to be the only ones that don't pass in the `files` argument of `NgtscTestEnvironment.setup`. When `files` isn't passed in, we don't hit the file path that sets up the `MockFileSystem`. With these changes I make it so that we always initialize the mock file system.\r\n2. The missing file system error usually comes from the `absoluteFrom` call that initializes the optional `workingDir` argument. My theory is that because it's a default value for an argument, it gets called too early before everything is initialized. These changes move the `absoluteFrom` call further down until it's needed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51804","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(compiler): attempt to deflake windows tests\" (#51804)"},{"Id":"1899273564","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-16T05:59:00","Actor":"sunilbaba","Number":"51803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular change detection was triggered by window addEventListeners","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nEvery event listeners that was there under a page trigger change detection cycle in angular application.

All the configutation is passed\nto `createParser()` params.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\nvar CssSelectorParser = require('css-selector-parser').CssSelectorParser,\nparser = new CssSelectorParser();\nparser.registerSelectorPseudos('has');\nparser.registerNumericPseudos('nth-child');\nparser.registerNestingOperators('>', '+', '~');\nparser.registerAttrEqualityMods('^', '$', '*', '~');\n\nconst selector = parser.parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({\n    syntax: {\n        pseudoClasses: {\n            // In 1.x any pseudo-classes were accepted.\n            // in 2.x parser only accepts known psuedo-classes unless `unknown: accept` was specified. \n            unknown: 'accept',\n            definitions: {\n                // This is a replacement for registerSelectorPseudos().\n                Selector: ['has'],\n                // This is a replacement for registerNumericPseudos().\n                Formula: ['nth-child']\n            }\n        },\n        // This is a replacement for registerNestingOperators().\n        combinators: ['>', '+', '~'],\n        attributes: {\n            // This a replacement for registerAttrEqualityMods().\n            // Note that equals sign (\"=\") is included into the operator definitions.\n            operators: ['^=', '$=', '*=', '~=']\n        }\n    },\n    // This is a replacement for enableSubstitutes()\n    substitutes: true\n});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\n-   [All syntax definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md)\n-   [All the psudo-class definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#pseudoclasses)\n-   [All the attribute definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#attributes)\n\n##### Predefined CSS syntax definitions\n\nYou no longer need to make an extensive configuration of `css-selector-parser` in order to make it understand\nthe necessary CSS standards. You can now just define CSS/CSS selectors version directly:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3'});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:nth-child(2n + 1)::before');\n```\n\nHere are the pre-defined CSS standards for your disposal:\n\n-   `css1`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/\n-   `css2`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/\n-   `css3`/`selectors-3`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/\n-   `selectors-4`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/\n-   `latest`: refers to `selectors-4`\n-   `progressive`: `latest` + accepts unknown psudo-classes, psudo-elements and attribute case sensitivity modifiers\n\n##### Make sure you use proper `strict` value\n\nCSS selector parser in modern browsers is very forgiving. For instance, it works fine with unclosed attribute\nselectors: `\"[attr=value\"`. If you would like to mimic this behavior from browsers, set `strict` to `false`, i.e.:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3', strict: false});\n\nconst selector = parse(':lang(en'); // doesn't crash\n```\n\n##### Render is now a separate export\n\n`render()` method used to be a method of `CssSelectorParser` class. Now it can be imported directly and used.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser, render} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'progressive'});\n\nconst selector = parse('div#user-123.user:lang(en)');\n\nconsole.log(render(selector)); // div#user-123.user:lang(en)\n```\n\n##### AST changes\n\nAST had a lot of changes.\n\n##### Selector\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstSelector.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `selector` -> `Selector`.\n2.  Prop changed: `selectors` -> `rules`, also `selectors` contained `ruleSet[]`, which in turn has `rule` field,\n    and new `rules` contains `Rule[]` directly.\n\nBefore: `{type: 'selector', selectors: [ {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 1 DATA>}}, {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 2 DATA>}} ]}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Selector', rules: [ {<RULE 1 DATA>}, {<RULE 2 DATA>} ]}`.\n\n##### Rule\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstRule.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `rule` -> `Rule`.\n2.  Prop changed: `id: string` -> `ids: string[]`. According to the CSS spec one rule may have more than 1 `id`,\n    so `#root#root` is a valid selector.\n3.  Prop renamed: `nestingOperator` -> `combinator`. A proper name according to CSS spec was chosen.\n4.  Prop renamed: `rule` -> `nestedRule`. A proper name to indicate nesting was chosen.\n5.  Prop changed: `tagName: string` -> `tag: TagName | WildcardTag`. Using explicit distinction between\n    TagName (i.e. `div`) and WildcardTag (`*`), because tag name can also be `*` if escaped properly (`\\*`).\n6.  Prop changed: `attrs` -> `attributes`. Attribute type was changed, see below.\n7.  Prop changed: `pseudos` -> `pseudoClasses`. There are pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, now they are separated\n    properly (there is a separate `pseudoElement` property). Pseudo class type was changed, see below.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'rule',\n    tagName: 'div',\n    id: 'user-123',\n    classNames: ['user'],\n    attrs: [\n        {name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}\n    ],\n    pseudos: [\n        {name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}\n    ],\n    nestingOperator: '>'\n})\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'Rule',\n    tag: {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'},\n    ids: ['user-123'],\n    classNames: ['user'],\n    attributes: [\n        {type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}}\n    ],\n    pseudoClasses: [\n        {type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', value: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}\n    ],\n    combinator: '>'\n})\n```\n\n##### Attribute\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `Attribute`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `value` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible value types.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md#value)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '=', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '=', value: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Pseudo Classes\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `PseudoClass`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `argument` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible argument types.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md#argument)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'visited'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'visited'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Example 4\n\nBefore: `{name: 'has', valueType: 'selector', value: {type: 'selector', selectors: [{type: 'ruleSet', rule: {type: 'rule', tagName: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'has', argument: {type: 'Selector', rules: [{type: 'Rule', tag: {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://togithub.com/mdevils/css-selector-parser/compare/0e517dc411b050964f2a291dcbe2218df9f1ef28...v2.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mdevils/css-selector-parser/compare/0e517dc411b050964f2a291dcbe2218df9f1ef28...v2.1.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Create a new standalone project using `ng new reproduction --standalone` (I'm currently using CLI version 16.2.2)\r\n2. In app.config.ts change line 7 to `providers: [provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())]` (or at least add withComponentInputBinding() to provideRouter)\r\n3. add the folder `src/app/components` with the following two files:\r\nparent.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-parent',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet],\r\n  template: `<p>p: {{p}}</p>\r\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet>`,\r\n  styles: []\r\n})\r\nexport default class ParentComponent {\r\n  @Input() p!: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nchild.component.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input, inject } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-child',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>p: {{p}}<br/>c: {{c}}</p>\r\n    <button (click)=\"changeC()\">Update C only</button><button (click)=\"changeP()\">Update P only</button><button (click)=\"changePC()\">Update P and C</button>`,\r\n  styles: []\r\n})\r\nexport default class ChildComponent {\r\n  @Input() p!: string;\r\n  @Input() c!: string;\r\n\r\n  router = inject(Router);\r\n\r\n  changeC() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([this.p, Math.random()]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changeP() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([Math.random(), this.c]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changePC() {\r\n    this.router.navigate([Math.random(), Math.random()]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. replace the content of app.route.ts with (redirectTo is added for convenience, not required to reproduce the issue):\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':p',\r\n        loadComponent: () => import('./components/parent.component'),\r\n        children: [\r\n            {\r\n                path: ':c',\r\n                loadComponent: () => import('./components/child.component')\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        path: '',\r\n        redirectTo: 'initial/value',\r\n        pathMatch: 'full'\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n5. run `ng serve --open`\r\n\r\nNotice when you click any of the buttons to navigate, ChildComponent gets undefined as a value for `p`, even though it initially got the correct value from the route. Hitting F5 will also cause ChildComponent to get the correct value again.\r\n\r\n**work-around**\r\nIf you are sure that the child component is only rendered when the params are provided, you can rewrite it to this to work around this issue:\r\n```\r\n/// imports and decorator.\r\nexport default class ChildComponent {\r\n    private _p: string = '';\r\n    @Input() \r\n    get p(): string {return this._p; }\r\n    set p(p: string) {\r\n        if(p !== undefined) {\r\n            this._p = p; // avoid setting undefined, keeping the initial value (this is the work around)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // etc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nNode: v18.16.1\r\nNode Version Manager: nvm 1.1.10\r\nOS: Windows 11\r\nAngular: 16.2.0 (only the default packages are required to reproduce)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51800","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component Input Binding gets param as undefined\" (#51800)"},{"Id":"1898457614","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T13:43:02","Actor":"mmu094","Number":"51799","RawContent":null,"Title":"rizqshops.com","State":"closed","Body":"Google Cloud\r\nRizq Cloudness\r\nOverview\r\nSolutions\r\nProducts\r\nPricing\r\nResources\r\nDocs\r\nOverview\r\nGuides\r\nReference\r\nResources\r\nSupport\r\nDiscover\r\nCloud Load Balancing overview\r\nChoose a load balancer\r\nLoad balancer feature comparison\r\nGet started\r\nRoles and permissions\r\nIAM Conditions for forwarding rules\r\nOrganization policy constraints\r\nApplication Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nLoad testing backends\r\nProxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL proxy)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nView metrics\r\nPassthrough Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP)\r\nOverview\r\nExternal load balancer\r\nInternal load balancer\r\nProtocol forwarding\r\nSecure\r\nSSL certificates\r\nSSL policies\r\nMutual TLS\r\nCustomize load balancer\r\nAdvanced load balancing optimizations\r\nBackend services\r\nConnection draining\r\nFirewall rules\r\nForwarding rules\r\nHealth checks\r\nInternal DNS names\r\nIPv6 termination\r\nNetwork endpoint groups\r\nProxy-only subnets\r\nTags\r\nTarget pools\r\nTarget proxies\r\nURL maps\r\nOperate and maintain\r\nAudit logging information\r\nHealth check logging information\r\nClean up a load balancer setup\r\nCloud Load Balancing \r\nDocumentation \r\nGuides\r\nWas this helpful?\r\n\r\nSend feedbackOrganization policy constraints for Cloud Load Balancing On this page\r\nRestrict load balancer types\r\nGKE error messages\r\nDisable global load balancing\r\nRestrict protocol forwarding types\r\nEnforce Shared VPC restrictions\r\nRestrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nRestrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nRestrict cross-project backend services\r\n\r\nThis page provides supplemental information about organization policy constraints that apply to Cloud Load Balancing. You use organization policy constraints to enforce settings across an entire project, folder, or organization.\r\n\r\nOrganization policies only apply to new resources. Constraints are not enforced retroactively. If you have pre-existing load-balancing resources that are in violation of a new organization policy, you will need to address such violations manually.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of available constraints, see Organization policy constraints.\r\n\r\nRestrict load balancer types\r\nUse an organization policy to restrict the Cloud Load Balancing types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Load Balancer Types ID:constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes When you set the compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the Cloud Load Balancing types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:\r\n\r\nINTERNAL_TCP_UDP for the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer INTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional internal Application Load Balancer GLOBAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the cross-region internal Application Load Balancer EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP for the external passthrough Network Load Balancer EXTERNAL_TCP_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with a TCP proxy EXTERNAL_SSL_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with an SSL proxy EXTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the classic Application Load Balancer EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional external Application Load Balancer REGIONAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional external proxy Network Load Balancer REGIONAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer GLOBAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the global external Application Load Balancer To include all internal or all external load balancer types, use the in: prefix followed by INTERNAL or EXTERNAL. For example, allowing in:INTERNAL allows all internal load balancers from the preceding list.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nAfter you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing Cloud Load Balancing configurations.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to create a load balancer of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:\r\n\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME of type SCHEME is not allowed.\r\nIf you set multiple restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypesconstraints at different resource levels, they are enforced hierarchically. For this reason, we recommended that you set the inheritFromParent field to true, which ensures that policies at higher layers are also considered.\r\n\r\nGKE error messages\r\nIf you are using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Service and Ingress objects, using this organization policy to restrict load balancer creation results in an error message similar to the following:\r\n\r\nWarning  Sync    28s   loadbalancer-controller  Error during sync: error running\r\nload balancer syncing routine: loadbalancer FORWARDING_RULE_NAME\r\ndoes not exist: googleapi: Error 412:\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes violated for\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID. Forwarding Rule\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/global/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME\r\nof type LOAD_BALANCER_TYPE is not allowed, conditionNotMet\r\nYou can view GKE error messages by running the following commands:\r\n\r\nkubectl get events -w\r\nkubectl describe RESOURCE_KIND NAME\r\nReplace the following:\r\n\r\nRESOURCE_KIND: the kind of load balancer, ingress or service NAME: the name of the load balancer\r\nDisable global load balancing\r\nThis boolean constraint disables creation of global load-balancing products. When enforced, only regional load-balancing products without global dependencies can be created.\r\n\r\n* Name: Disable Global Load Balancing\r\n* ID:constraints/compute.disableGlobalLoadBalancing By default, users are allowed to create global load-balancing products.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict protocol forwarding types\r\nUse an organization policy to restrict the protocol forwarding types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Protocol Forwarding Based on type of IP Address ID:constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes When you set the compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the protocol forwarding types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:\r\n\r\nINTERNAL\r\nEXTERNAL\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nAfter you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing protocol forwarding configurations.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to create a protocol forwarding deployment of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:\r\n\r\nConstraint constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME of type SCHEME is not allowed.\r\nIf you set multiple restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraints at different resource levels, and if you set the inheritFromParent field to true, then the constraints are enforced hierarchically.\r\n\r\nEnforce Shared VPC restrictions\r\nUse the following organization policies to restrict how users are allowed to set up Shared VPC deployments.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nThis list constraint lets you restrict the Shared VPC host projects that a resource can attach to.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC host projects\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjects By default, a project can attach to any host project in the same organization, thereby becoming a service project. When you set thecompute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjectsconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of host projects in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify a project in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID\r\nSpecify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all projects under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nThis list constraint defines the set of Shared VPC subnets that eligible resources can use. This constraint does not apply to resources within the same project.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC subnetworks\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks By default, eligible resources can use any Shared VPC subnet. When you set the compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworksconstraint, you specify a restricted list of subnets in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify a subnet in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME. Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all subnets under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nunder:projects/PROJECT_ID\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict cross-project backend services\r\nNote: This constraint only applies to Shared VPC deployments that use cross-project service referencing. Currently, cross-project service referencing is only supported by internal Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers. You can use this constraint to limit the backend services that a URL map can reference. This constraint does not apply to backend services within the same project as the URL map.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict cross-project backend services\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcBackendServices By default, URL maps in all host or service projects can reference compatible backend services from other service projects or the host project in the same Shared VPC deployment as long as the user performing the action has thecompute.backendServices.usepermission. When you set therestrictSharedVpcBackendServicesconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of backend services in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSpecify backend services in the following format:\r\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/backendServices/BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all backend services under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID\r\nunder:folders/FOLDER_ID\r\nunder:projects/PROJECT_ID\r\nAfter you set up an organization policy with this constraint, the constraint goes into effect the next time you use the gcloud compute url-maps command to attach a backend service to a URL map. The constraint does not retroactively affect existing references to any cross-project backend services.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nRestrict Shared VPC project lien removal\r\nThis boolean constraint restricts the set of users that can remove a Shared VPC host project lien without organization-level permission where this constraint is already set to True.\r\n\r\nName: Restrict Shared VPC project lien removal\r\nID:constraints/compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval By default, any user with the permission to update liens can remove a Shared VPC host project lien. Enforcing this constraint requires that permission be granted at the organization level.\r\n\r\nFor sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.\r\n\r\nSet up boolean constraints with organization policies Permissions required for this task\r\nConsolegcloud\r\nTo set an organization policy from the console, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nIn the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page. Go to Organization policies\r\n\r\nIn the Filter field, search for the constraint either by Name or by ID. Click the name of the constraint.\r\nClick Edit to edit the constraint.\r\nOn the Edit page, select Customize.\r\nUnder Enforcement, select an enforcement option:\r\nTo enable enforcement of this constraint, select On. To disable enforcement of this constraint, select Off. After making changes, click Saveto apply the constraint settings. For detailed instructions about customizing organization policies by using the Google Cloud console, see Customizing policies for boolean constraints.\r\n\r\nSet up list constraints with organization policies Permissions required for this task\r\nConsolegcloud\r\nTo set an organization policy from the console, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nIn the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page. Go to Organization policies\r\n\r\nIn the Filter field, search for the constraint either by Name or by ID. For example, to restrict Shared VPC host projects, you search for the ID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjects. Click the name of the constraint.\r\nClick Edit to edit the constraint.\r\nTo create a custom policy, select Customize and specify the allowlist or denylist of resources.

This can happen with the longer reactivity chains where one of the computed signals is marked for re-computation but when recomputed it returns the same value. In this situation we should skip dirty-checking of such views.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal stackblitz demonstrating the situation: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bxm5fu?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nGiven the above stackblitz, notice that the OnPush component is change detected even if non of the displayed values change.

However, after around 5 years of working with it, and in lights of the recent changes going around in the Angular community, I believe it might be a good time to reconsider the future of managing forms in Angular. \r\n\r\n The main things that I would like to improve is simplify the API, reduce boilerplate code, make the API for managing different kind of states (disabling, validation) more consistent (aka declarative vs imperative, `ControlValueAccessor` managed vs CSS managed etc), make it more open to extension with the entire form logic in one place etc, and - if we are already revisiting it - make use of a more modern API (signals). \r\n \r\nAs a first step, I've created a design proposition for what this could be. I believe this could be both easier to work with and more flexible, compared to Angular's current solution. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this post is to get some initial feedback, start the conversation, and see if other people are interested in this direction. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBefore we start, here are some high level goals for this design:\r\n\r\n- Easy initialization\r\n    - Define logic in one place\r\n- Easy binding / property accessing\r\n- Close for modification and extendable (open-close)\r\n- Minimal\r\n- Type safety\r\n    - Including in the template! So you'll not be able to use a CVA component with the wrong control.\r\n- Separation of logic (value, disability, validity)\r\n- Modern API (signals)\r\n- Easier access of (custom) state (aka, not just built in disabled / validation) by custom form components (or their children). (This relates to the usage in the template more than anything else). (For example, if we want to show a component differently if it's required)\r\n\r\n# Proposition\r\n\r\nWe'll have a single type (not class) called `Form`. This type will be used for what `FormControl`, `FormGroup` and `FormArray` were used before.\r\n\r\nEach instance of `Form` will enable two way binding, listening to changes (via signals API), and plugging in of other state like disability and validation. The other state will be separated and pluggable so it will be easy to extend it in a way that is open-close.\r\n\r\n## Core Behavior\r\n\r\n### Creating a `Form`\r\n\r\nCreate a form is as easy is passing the default value to the `form` factory function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst name = form('Sweeney');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type is inferred to be `Form<string>`. You can also be explicitly set the type (to be more specific or more generic):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst name = form<string>('Sweeney');\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading/listening to the value can be done like you would with regular signals:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.log('name', name());\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!note]\r\n> We need to make sure that the value that is returned from the form this way is readonly, to avoid a situation where a consumer can mess with it. It might be the case that it works ootb with signals, but we need to check.\r\n\r\nSetting the value can be done with any of the `WritableSignal` methods (`set`, `update` or `mutate`):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nname.set('Ms. Lovett');\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!warning]\r\n> Even though to the consumer the form looks like a signal (and it's assignable to its interface), it will actually need to be implemented differently, even though it will use the signals infra behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n### Nested forms\r\n\r\nWhen your `Form` has a generic that is either an object or an array, you'll also have the `fields` signal available on it as a property.\r\n\r\n> [!note]\r\n> If the generic is a union type that can be either an object or something else, the `fields` property will not exist\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n  name: \"Sweeney\",\r\n  age: 42,\r\n});\r\nmyForm.fields().name.set(\"Sweeney Todd\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you are creating a form in this way, you can also pass the `Form` objects directly as properties, instead of as values. This can be useful if you want to set different validators / disabled state / type.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n  name: form(\"Sweeney\"),\r\n  age: form(42),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen used in this way, the inferred value will still be `{ name: string, age: number }`\r\n\r\nThis works the same with an array:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst characters = form(['Sweeney', 'Ms. Lovett']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to `ReactiveForms`'s `FormArray`.\r\n\r\nWhen setting value to the `form`, any listeners for the children events, will be updated.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n  name: \"Sweeney\",\r\n  age: 42,\r\n});\r\n\r\neffect(() => {\r\n  console.log('name', myForm.fields().name())\r\n});\r\n\r\nmyForm.set({ name: \"Ms. Lovett\", age: 38 }); // prints: name \"Ms. Lovette\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen setting value to one of the children, any listeners to the form value will be updated.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n  name: \"Sweeney\",\r\n  age: 42,\r\n});\r\n\r\neffect(() => {\r\n  console.log('form value', myForm());\r\n});\r\n\r\nmyForm.fields().name.set('Sweeney Todd'); // prints: form value { name: \"Sweeney Todd\", age: 42}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen changing the value, you could also change the number of fields in the form. This is especially useful for arrays, but can be used in objects as well.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myArray = form(['Shahar', 'Adi']);\r\nmyArray.mutate(array => array.push('Alma')); // this creates a new field\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen listening to the `fields` signal change, it will only emit a change when the fields themselves are changing, not if one of the values are changing. Fields that ere not touched in this change, should have a reference to the same `Form` object.\r\n\r\nThis is useful if you have a `Form` with changing elements, like an array:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let field of myForm.fields()\">\r\n\t<input [form]=\"field\" />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(In the example above we make use of the \"form\" directive)\r\n\r\n## View Binding\r\n\r\nIn order to bind the new controls to the DOM, you can use the `[form]` directive like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input [form]=\"myFormField\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will work out of the box for native fields like `input`, and will be type-safe, so you can only pass it `Form<string>` if you're using it with an `input` of type text.\r\n### Compatibility layer with reactive forms\r\n\r\nThe compatibility layer will be available under a separate library so it's optional. It has a peer dependency on Angular reactive forms, and - when imported - it enables binding forms to any component that provides `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`. So that you can use it with your custom components.\r\n\r\nIt will handle:\r\n\r\n- Updating the value both ways (using `writeValue` and `registerOnchange`)\r\n- Updating the touched state.\r\n- Updating the disabled state.\r\n\r\n### API for implementing custom components\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n\r\n- Type safety in templates (for custom components)\r\n- Ease of development\r\n\r\nTo implement a custom component, you need to extend this class:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass FormFieldComponent<T> {\r\n  @Input('form')\r\n  field: Form<T>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#todo _we might want to create a different API here for signal components' inputs. We might also enable both options._ _If we can create a functional API, it's probably better_\r\n\r\nThis enables type safety in the template.\r\n\r\n## Disabled State\r\n\r\n\"disabled\" is a boolean state that is conventionally used to signal that a field cannot be edited by the user. However, it doesn't mean that you can't programmatically change it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid contradictions, and to encourage a declarative approach, it will not be possible to change the disabled state imperatively.\r\n\r\nTo define the state of the disabled state of a form control, use the `disabled` function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction disabled(state: Signal<boolean | string | { toString?: () => string}>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(string is a user friendly disabled _reason_)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst isDisabled = computed(...);\r\nconst nameForm = form('Shahar', disabled(isDisabled);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo read the disabled state:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nisDisabled(myForm);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses a signal behind the scenes, so you can use it to listen for changes inside an `effect` or `compute`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\neffect(() => {\r\n  console.log('form is disabled changed to', isDisabled(myForm));\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to read it from the template, you can use a pipe:\r\n\r\n```angular\r\nDisabled: {{ myForm | formIsDisabled }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll pipes will be standalones and need to be imported.\r\n\r\nYou can also set the initial disabled state of the form this way:\r\n\r\nYou can read the disabled reason with those functions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfirstDisabledReason(myForm); // will return null if not disabled\r\n\r\ndisabledReasons(myForm); // return string[] of all reasons\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use this in the template with the `formFirstDisabledReason` and `formDisabledReasons` pipes.\r\n\r\n### View binding\r\n\r\nBy default when importing the `FormsModule` and using the `[form]` directive, a `disabled` attribute will be added to the host.\r\n\r\n> [!question]\r\n> Is it possible that a consumer will not want it? Do we need to be able to disable this behavior?\r\n> \r\n> If needed, we can make this configurable in the `forRoot` options of `FormsModule`\r\n\r\n> [!note]- Implementation Note\r\n> This will be done by creating a `FormDisabledDirective` with the same selector that handles that.\r\n\r\n## Dirty State\r\n\r\n\"dirty\" is a Boolean state that is conventionally used to mark that a field was edited by the user. Common use-cases include:\r\n\r\n- Show invalid indication only when dirty\r\n- Enable save only when form is dirty\r\n\r\nReading the value:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nisDirty(name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses signal behind the scenes, so it can be listened to\r\n\r\nSetting the value:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nsetIsDirty(name, false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though it is used to show that the field was edited by the user, using `set` on a field does not automatically make it's \"dirty\" state true. You need to programmatically set the value to signal a user-invoked change:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nname.set('Mr.' + lastName);\r\nsetIsDirty(name, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen binding fields to components, we'll use a dedicate directive (see later)\r\n\r\n## Touched State\r\n\r\n\"touched\" is a boolean state that is conventionally used to mark that a field was touched (but not necessary edited) by the user.\r\n\r\n- Show invalid indication only when dirty\r\n\r\nThis has the same API as dirty state.\r\n\r\nThe compatibility layer with reactive forms handles setting the touched state when using the directive with a component that provides `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`.\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n\r\nTo add a validation to the form, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nform('', validation(required));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince signals allow for a reactive API that can use any state, validators will be immutable, that means that contrary to `ReactiveForms`'s built in `setValidators`, in this library we cannot change the validators of a field after we've created it.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple validations this way:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nform('', validation(required, min(3)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be used together with the `disabled` state this way:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nform('', validation(required), disabled(true));\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!note] Order doesn't matter\r\n> You can also add the disabled state before the validation state (order doesn't matter)\r\n\r\nTo read the validation state of the form, you can use the following functions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction isValid(form: Form): boolean;\r\nfunction isInvalid(form: Form): boolean;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get a user-friendly error message for the validation, you can use these functions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction firstErrorMessage(field: Field): string | null; // null if valid or no error message available\r\nfunction errorMessages(field: Field): string[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these use signal behind the scenes, so they can be used in a reactive context.\r\n\r\n### Form Status\r\n\r\nTo read the validation state, use any of these functions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nformStatus(myForm);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns `'valid'` | `'invalid'` | `'pending'` | `'disabled'`. The `disabled` status is based on the disabled state.\r\n\r\n### View Binding\r\n\r\nBy default when importing the `FormsModule` and using the `[form]` directive, it will add `invalid`, `valid`, `validation-pending` classes based on the state of the validation of the control.\r\n\r\n> [!question]\r\n> Should we prefix these names to avoid collisions?\r\n>\r\n> Is it even a good idea? Maybe we want this only for native elements?\r\n>\r\n> Is it possible that consumers will want to disable this behavior?\r\n\r\nThese classes can be used globally like `ng-invalid` to add styling to your components.\r\n\r\nThis will be accomplished by a dedicated `FormValidationDirective`\r\n\r\n### Customize Error Messages for built-in validators\r\n\r\nTo customize error messages of build in validators you can use the following API:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nrequired.errorMessage(\"Required Field!\"); // when passing a string here, the error message will always be the same\r\nmin.errorMessage(({min}) => `Value needs to be bigger than ${min}`); // use a callback to read data from the validator\r\n```\r\n\r\n(These callbacks are typed, so you can be sure you're reading the correct error type)\r\n\r\n> [!note]- About implementation\r\n> We might want to have some sort of utility function with that wraps those validators and enables this functionality. We can also expose this utility function to the public API so consumers can use it.\r\n\r\n### Custom Validations\r\n\r\nIn order to add validation to your form, you need to define a `Validator`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype ValidationError = string | {\r\n\ttoString?: () => string;\r\n}\r\ntype ValidationFn<Value> = (form: Form<Value>) => Signal<ValidationError | null>;\r\ntype Validator<Value> = ValidationFn<Value, Errors> | Signal<ValidationError>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example of a validator\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction required(form: Form<any>) {\r\n return computed(() => form.value() ? null : `This field is required`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnlike `ReactiveForms`, this validation function will be called _once_. Note that the form in the argument is there for convenience and reusability, but you can use any signal when creating it.\r\n\r\nThis set up makes it easier to write custom validators, that use different fields as a condition to the validation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst isNameRequired = field(false);\r\n\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n name: field('', (name) => {\r\n   return isNameRequired.value() && !name.value() ? { required: true } : null\r\n }),\r\n isNameRequired,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation function can be strictly typed, so that this will not be allowed:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction min(form: Form<number>): Signal<ValidationErrors | null>;\r\n\r\nform('', validation(min)); // ERROR: the validation type does not match the form type\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation function can be strictly typed, so that this will not be allowed:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction min(form: Form<number>): Signal<ValidationErrors | null>;\r\n\r\nform('', validation(min)); // ERROR: the validation type does not match the form type\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the error, you can return a string that will be used as a validation error message. If have other code that needs to read the error message content, you can also return an object with a `toString` method, that returns the error message. If you don't supply the `toString`, you might get `null` if you try to read error messages.\r\n\r\n### \"Async\" Validators\r\n\r\nSometimes, validators need to run asynchronously. For that, you can use the `PENDING` symbol:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nisNameUsedValidator(form: Form<string>) {\r\n  const name$ = toObservable(form);\r\n\r\n  const validationErrors$ = name$\r\n    .pipe(\r\n\t\tswitchMap(\r\n\t\t\tname => http.get('/is_available/${name}')\r\n\t\t\t\t.pipe(startWith(PENDING)) // every name change we need the PENDIG state\r\n\t\t\t),\r\n\t\tmap(isAvailable => isVailable ? null : {taken: true}),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n\treturn toSignal(name$, PENDING);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Running Validation Lazily\r\n\r\nContrary to `ReactiveForms`, all validations will always be run together. If you have validation that are potentially expensive on calculation / network, and you don't want to run them if you don't have to (for example, when there are other errored validations), you need to explicitly ask for it:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nform('', validations(\r\n\trequired,\r\n\trunOnlyIfNeeded(isNameUsedValidator),\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!note]- About implementation\r\n>\r\n> We'll use the attribute of signals that they are lazily evaluated. In the `compute` that calculates the validation errors, we need to ask for the \"runOnlyIfNeeded\" ones only if there aren't any other validators:\r\n>\r\n> ```ts\r\n> const validationErrors = compute(() => {\r\n>   const validationErrors = eagerValidationError.map(validationErrors => validationErrors());\r\n>\r\n>   if (!validationErrors.length) {\r\n>     for (const lazyValidationError of lazyValidationErrors) {\r\n>       if (lazyValidationError()) {\r\n> \t      return [lazyValidationError];\r\n>       }\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n>\r\n>   return  validationErrors;\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> Note - this will still run all lazy validations together. Might want to rewrite it so that it also returns all errors\r\n\r\n### Supporting NG_VALIDATOR\r\n\r\nThis feature in `Angular`'s `ReactiveForms` enables you to create a built-in validator inside a custom form control, which will cause it to be invalid and/or have errors. This uses `setValidators` behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with this approach in `ReactiveForms`: \r\n\r\n- Using `setValidators` does not automatically run the validations again, so the control might not get invalid even though it should be.\r\n- If the custom control component was destroyed, the validator is removed. If the control was previously invalid, it might be become valid again when running update value and validity. This is usually not the desire behavior, since this case occurs usually when you hide views from the user, and you don't really want logic to change as a result. (For example, if you have a form that is divided to multiple routes)\r\n\r\nTo support NG_VALIDATOR, we'll have an *internal* function that can add errors (not validators) to the validation state of the control. \r\n\r\nWe'll create `FormCustomValidatorDirective` that will use this internal function in hook into the `NG_VALIDATORS` provider to make this work.\r\n\r\n> [!question]\r\n> - Do we want this only for the compatibility layer, or do we also want to supply our own API for this?\r\n\r\n### Error Aggregation\r\n\r\nIt's also sometimes useful to display all the errors of the form in one place. This should be possible to create utility function that aggregate errors. We might also want to add the functionality to add a display name to the form that will be used here. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst firstName = form('',\r\n  displayName('First Name')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Binding Validation Information to View\r\n\r\nA common use case, is to display an Asterix next to a required field label, or an message bellow a field. We would ideally want to implement this behavior once for our design system, so that it will work with all custom controls. \r\n\r\nThere are two possible architectures here:\r\n\r\nField wrapper:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- consumer.html -->\r\n<app-form-field>\r\n  <app-form-label>Name</app-form-label>\r\n  <app-text-field [form]=\"nameForm\"/>\r\n</app-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLabel inside the field:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- consumer.html -->\r\n<app-text-field \r\n   label=\"Name\"\r\n   [form]=\"nameForm\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<!-- text-field.component.html -->\r\n<app-field-frame>\r\n   <app-form-label>{{label}}</app-form-label>\r\n   ... <!-- text field implementation -->\r\n</app-field-frame>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is that in the first use case the form directive is used as a child of the component in which we want to access it form, and the second use-case the form directive is a parent of the component we want to access it from.\r\n#### Accessing form of parent\r\n\r\nTo access the form of a parent, you can use the utility `injectForm()`. It will return a `Form` object if there is a parent that uses it. If there is more than one, it will return the first one from the bottom. \r\n\r\nNow, for example, if you want to check whether the form is required, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nreadonly isRequired = computed(() => {\r\n  return getFormValidators(this.form).includes(required);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Accessing form of child\r\n\r\nTo access the form of a child, you can add the `FormAccessorDirective` as a host directive of your wrapper component. This directive uses `@ContentChild` behind the scenes, and this way you can use the function `injectChildForm` to get the form of the first child.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Custom State\r\n\r\nWe can extend the behavior of the form controls with custom state using the function `createFormState`. Many of the form states described before use it behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction createFormState<T, Args extends any[]>(\r\n  descr: string,\r\n  fallback: T,\r\n  createInitialState: (form: Form<any>, ...args: Args) => T),\r\n): {\r\n  create: (...args: Args) => StateFactory, \r\n  get: (form: Form<any>) => T, // returns the fallback if doesn't exist\r\n  set: (form: Form<any>, state: T) => void,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how you can use it:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\n// display-name.ts\r\n\r\nexport const {\r\n  create: displayName, \r\n  get: getDisplayName,\r\n  set: setDisplayName\r\n} = createFormState(\r\n  \"Display Name\",\r\n  \"\",\r\n  (form: Form<any>, displayName: string) => {\r\n    return displayName;\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n\r\n// my-form.ts\r\n\r\nimport { displayName, getDisplayName } from './my-custom-disabled-state';\r\n\r\nconst myForm = form({\r\n  name: \"John\",\r\n  age: 42,\r\n}, displayName('Person'));\r\n\r\nconst displayNamed = getDisplayName(myForm);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis infra will also be used behind the scenes to support Disabled State, Dirty State]] and Validation.\r\n\r\nNote that as other utilities, the getter uses signal behind the scenes so you can listen to changes as well. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51786","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposition: Alternative, Simplified Forms API\" (#51786)"},{"Id":"1897195385","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-14T19:42:43","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"51785","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update to latest version of material","State":"open","Body":"Update to the latest version of material\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51785","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update to latest version of material\" (#51785)"},{"Id":"1897146853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-14T19:06:44","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"51783","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `b02604d` -> `83d6a0c` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/components) | dependencies | major | [`^16.2.4` -> `^17.0.0-next`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/16.2.4/17.0.0-next.3) |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `1c6c16f` -> `1856841` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f245bb8` -> `bc9a2e4` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/material)</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0-next.3`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next3-rock-rock-2023-09-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/17.0.0-next.2...17.0.0-next.3)\n\n##### material\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [db06fa8d89](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/db06fa8d8939d793f598bc3dbedc96a5a71c0db0) | fix | **autocomplete:** requireSelection incorrectly resetting value when there are no options ([#&#8203;27781](https://togithub.com/angular/components/pull/27781)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v17.0.0-next.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next2-metal-monkey-2023-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/17.0.0-next.1...17.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### multiple\n\n-   -   Themes are now more strictly validated when calling Angular Material\n        theme mixins.

The initial implementation is still experimental and lacks a lot of features, but it is sufficient to run tests generated by `ng new`.\r\n\r\nThere's no docs or setup instructions yet, however the main path to trying this out is to replace `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in `angular.json`. Since Web Test Runner is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Karma, options should mostly align. Currently only a couple options are actually supported right now, but more will be added over time.\r\n\r\nThe commit messages go more in detail on the implementation. In particular, Web Test Runner integration is done via a custom HTML page which explicitly loads the user's JavaScript in a very particular order. This allows our custom Jasmine integration, sets up Zone.js to patch those symbols correctly, configures `TestBed`, and then runs the user's tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently some unrelated unit tests appear to be failing due to Web Test Runner pulling in `@types/mocha` which is conflicting with `@types/jasmine`. I'm looking into the proper fix for that.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25860","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial Web Test Runner Implementation\" (#25860)"},{"Id":"1899073535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T21:02:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25859","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based application build system through either the `application` or `browser-esbuild` builder, the `localize` option will now allow inlining project defined localizations. The process to configure and enable the i18n system is the same as with the Webpack-based `browser` builder. The implementation uses a similar approach to the `browser` builder in which the application is built once and then post-processed for each active locale. In addition to inlining translations, the locale identifier is injected and the locale specific data is added to the applications. Currently, this implementation adds all the locale specific data to each application during the initial building. While this may cause a small increase in the polyfills bundle (locale data is very small in size), it has a benefit of faster builds and a significantly less complicated build process. Additional size optimizations to the data itself are also being considered to even further reduce impact.

That included identifiers such as `none` which have special meaning in CSS, and which should not be treated as custom local identifiers. This release fixes this bug:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    ul { list-style-type: none }\n\n    /* Old output (with --loader=local-css) */\n    ul {\n      list-style-type: stdin_none;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --loader=local-css) */\n    ul {\n      list-style-type: none;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that this bug only affected code using the `local-css` loader. It did not affect code using the `css` loader.\n\n-   Avoid inserting temporary variables before `use strict` ([#&#8203;3322](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3322))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild could incorrectly insert automatically-generated temporary variables before `use strict` directives:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function foo() {\n      'use strict'\n      a.b?.c()\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    function foo() {\n      var _a;\n      \"use strict\";\n      (_a = a.b) == null ? void 0 : _a.c();\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    function foo() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      var _a;\n      (_a = a.b) == null ? void 0 : _a.c();\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Adjust TypeScript `enum` output to better approximate `tsc` ([#&#8203;3329](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3329))\n\n    TypeScript enum values can be either number literals or string literals. Numbers create a bidirectional mapping between the name and the value but strings only create a unidirectional mapping from the name to the value. When the enum value is neither a number literal nor a string literal, TypeScript and esbuild both default to treating it as a number:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    declare const foo: any\n    enum Foo {\n      NUMBER = 1,\n      STRING = 'a',\n      OTHER = foo,\n    }\n\n    // Compiled JavaScript code (from \"tsc\")\n    var Foo;\n    (function (Foo) {\n      Foo[Foo[\"NUMBER\"] = 1] = \"NUMBER\";\n      Foo[\"STRING\"] = \"a\";\n      Foo[Foo[\"OTHER\"] = foo] = \"OTHER\";\n    })(Foo || (Foo = {}));\n    ```\n\n    However, TypeScript does constant folding slightly differently than esbuild. For example, it may consider template literals to be string literals in some cases:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    declare const foo = 'foo'\n    enum Foo {\n      PRESENT = `${foo}`,\n      MISSING = `${bar}`,\n    }\n\n    // Compiled JavaScript code (from \"tsc\")\n    var Foo;\n    (function (Foo) {\n      Foo[\"PRESENT\"] = \"foo\";\n      Foo[Foo[\"MISSING\"] = `${bar}`] = \"MISSING\";\n    })(Foo || (Foo = {}));\n    ```\n\n    The template literal initializer for `PRESENT` is treated as a string while the template literal initializer for `MISSING` is treated as a number. Previously esbuild treated both of these cases as a number but starting with this release, esbuild will now treat both of these cases as a string. This doesn't exactly match the behavior of `tsc` but in the case where the behavior diverges `tsc` reports a compile error, so this seems like acceptible behavior for esbuild. Note that handling these cases completely correctly would require esbuild to parse type declarations (see the `declare` keyword), which esbuild deliberately doesn't do.\n\n-   Ignore case in CSS in more places ([#&#8203;3316](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3316))\n\n    This release makes esbuild's CSS support more case-agnostic, which better matches how browsers work. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo { From { OpaCity: 0 } To { OpaCity: 1 } }\n    body { CoLoR: YeLLoW }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo{From {OpaCity: 0} To {OpaCity: 1}}body{CoLoR:YeLLoW}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;KeyFrames Foo{0%{OpaCity:0}To{OpaCity:1}}body{CoLoR:#ff0}\n    ```\n\n    Please never actually write code like this.\n\n-   Improve the error message for `null` entries in `exports` ([#&#8203;3377](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3377))\n\n    Package authors can disable package export paths with the `exports` map in `package.json`. With this release, esbuild now has a clearer error message that points to the `null` token in `package.json` itself instead of to the surrounding context. Here is an example of the new error message:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"msw/browser\"\n\n            lib/msw-config.ts:2:28:\n              2 │ import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser';\n                ╵                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          The path \"./browser\" cannot be imported from package \"msw\" because it was explicitly disabled by\n          the package author here:\n\n            node_modules/msw/package.json:17:14:\n              17 │       \"node\": null,\n                 ╵               ~~~~\n\n          You can mark the path \"msw/browser\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove\n          this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n\n-   Parse and print the `with` keyword in `import` statements\n\n    JavaScript was going to have a feature called \"import assertions\" that adds an `assert` keyword to `import` statements. It looked like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import stuff from './stuff.json' assert { type: 'json' }\n    ```\n\n    The feature provided a way to assert that the imported file is of a certain type (but was not allowed to affect how the import is interpreted, even though that's how everyone expected it to behave). The feature was fully specified and then actually implemented and shipped in Chrome before the people behind the feature realized that they should allow it to affect how the import is interpreted after all. So import assertions are no longer going to be added to the language.\n\n    Instead, the [current proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes) is to add a feature called \"import attributes\" instead that adds a `with` keyword to import statements. It looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import stuff from './stuff.json' with { type: 'json' }\n    ```\n\n    This feature provides a way to affect how the import is interpreted. With this release, esbuild now has preliminary support for parsing and printing this new `with` keyword. The `with` keyword is not yet interpreted by esbuild, however, so bundling code with it will generate a build error. All this release does is allow you to use esbuild to process code containing it (such as removing types from TypeScript code). Note that this syntax is not yet a part of JavaScript and may be removed or altered in the future if the specification changes (which it already has once, as described above). If that happens, esbuild reserves the right to remove or alter its support for this syntax too.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.67.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1670)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.66.1...1.67.0)\n\n-   All functions defined in CSS Values and Units 4 are now once again parsed as\n    calculation objects: `round()`, `mod()`, `rem()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`,\n    `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`, `hypot()`,\n    `log()`, `exp()`, `abs()`, and `sign()`.\n\n    Unlike in 1.65.0, function calls are *not* locked into being parsed as\n    calculations or plain Sass functions at parse-time. This means that\n    user-defined functions will take precedence over CSS calculations of the same\n    name. Although the function names `calc()` and `clamp()` are still forbidden,\n    users may continue to freely define functions whose names overlap with other\n    CSS calculations (including `abs()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `round()` whose\n    names overlap with global Sass functions).\n\n-   As a consequence of the change in calculation parsing described above,\n    calculation functions containing interpolation are now parsed more strictly\n    than before. However, all interpolations that would have produced valid CSS\n    will continue to work, so this is not considered a breaking change.\n\n-   Interpolations in calculation functions that aren't used in a position that\n    could also have a normal calculation value are now deprecated. For example,\n    `calc(1px #{\"+ 2px\"})` is deprecated, but `calc(1px + #{\"2px\"})` is still\n    allowed. This deprecation is named `calc-interp`. See [the Sass website] for\n    more information.\n\n    [the Sass website]: https://sass-lang.com/d/calc-interp\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix**: The importer used to load a given file is no\n    longer used to load absolute URLs that appear in that file. This was\n    unintented behavior that contradicted the Sass specification. Absolute URLs\n    will now correctly be loaded only from the global importer list. This applies\n    to the modern JS API, the Dart API, and the embedded protocol.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Substantially improve the embedded compiler's performance when compiling many\n    files or files that require many importer or function call round-trips with\n    the embedded host.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v0.19.11`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01911)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.10...v0.19.11)\n\n-   Fix TypeScript-specific class transform edge case ([#&#8203;3559](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3559))\n\n    The previous release introduced an optimization that avoided transforming `super()` in the class constructor for TypeScript code compiled with `useDefineForClassFields` set to `false` if all class instance fields have no initializers. The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case *and* there are `#private` instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to `super()` (since `super()` is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      public: any;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.#private = 1;\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        this.#private = 1;\n        super();\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: allow reording a primitive past a side-effect ([#&#8203;3568](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3568))\n\n    The minifier previously allowed reordering a side-effect past a primitive, but didn't handle the case of reordering a primitive past a side-effect. This additional case is now handled:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f() {\n      let x = false;\n      let y = x;\n      const boolean = y;\n      let frag = $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${boolean}\">hello world</p>`);\n      return frag;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(){const e=!1;return $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${e}\">hello world</p>`)}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(){return $.template('<p contenteditable=\"false\">hello world</p>')}\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: consider properties named using known `Symbol` instances to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;3561](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3561))\n\n    Many things in JavaScript can have side effects including property accesses and ToString operations, so using a symbol such as `Symbol.iterator` as a computed property name is not obviously side-effect free. This release adds a special case for known `Symbol` instances so that they are considered side-effect free when used as property names. For example, this class declaration will now be considered side-effect free:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Provide the `stop()` API in node to exit esbuild's child process ([#&#8203;3558](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3558))\n\n    You can now call `stop()` in esbuild's node API to exit esbuild's child process to reclaim the resources used. It only makes sense to do this for a long-lived node process when you know you will no longer be making any more esbuild API calls. It is not necessary to call this to allow node to exit, and it's advantageous to not call this in between calls to esbuild's API as sharing a single long-lived esbuild child process is more efficient than re-creating a new esbuild child process for every API call. This API call used to exist but was removed in [version 0.9.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.9.0). This release adds it back due to a user request.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Some Angular newbies might feel confused sometimes. Is it possible to avoid this message been shown to the user?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI think this could be configurable for default newline characters. It can be detected easily for user's `core.autocrlf` setting of Git. So it's possible that change the newline of all the generated text file from LF to CRLF when needed.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWorkaround 1: Avoid `git init` after `ng new` and do it by user itself\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nng new demo1 --skip-git\r\ncd demo1\r\ngit init -b main\r\ngit config --local core.autocrlf false\r\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround 2: Change `core.autocrlf` setting of Git to `false`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit config --global core.autocrlf false\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26764","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Avoid \"LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it\" warning on Windows\" (#26764)"},{"Id":"2058427614","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-28T13:48:10","Actor":"lokeshv12","Number":"26762","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular-devkit/build-angular 17.0.8: 4 moderate severity vulnerabilities","State":"closed","Body":"While installing latest Angular version, I found 4 moderate security vulnerables.

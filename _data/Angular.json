In a real-world application this model is probably shared and we want to use it also for the case when storing and retrieving data.\nI want to use the model as it is without the need to wrap it in a TS utility like `Required<T>` which will make the optional fields non-optional. But when trying to use the type `Book` in the example directly, I run into a build time error:\n\n```text\n✘ [ERROR] TS2322: Type 'MaybeFieldTree<string | undefined, string>' is not assignable to type '() => FieldState<string, string | number>'.\n  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type '() => FieldState<string, string | number>'.

your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n\n```starlark\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_js\", version = \"2.8.0\")\n\n####### Node.js version #########\n\n# By default you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @&#8203;rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\n# Optionally you can pin a different node version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@&#8203;rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"18.14.2\")\n\n#################################\n\nnpm =

matching pnpm version, for example:\n\n# bazel run -- @&#8203;pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\n```\n\n#### Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@&#8203;bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"aspect_rules_js\",\n    sha256 =

project, different configurations) causes “504 Outdated Optimize Dep” errors in Angular CLI 20.3.8","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.6\n\n### Description\n\nSince updating to Angular v20.3.9 / CLI v20.3.8, it’s no longer possible to run two ng serve instances for the same project (e.g. localized builds) in parallel.\nThe second instance fails to load with a 504 (Outdated Optimize Dep) error for one or more chunks (e.g. chunk-5V7QYGNA.js).\n\nThis setup worked correctly in previous Angular 20.3.6 versions (before the CLI migrated the dev-server to the Vite-based implementation).\n\nThe issue appears to be caused by both ng serve processes sharing the same Vite optimizer cache directory inside .angular/cache/.../vite.\nWhen one process updates or invalidates the cache, the other process detects stale metadata and refuses to serve pre-bundled chunks.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\npackage.json scripts\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"ng serve --host 0.0.0.0\",\n  \"startfr\": \"ng serve -c fr --host

npm run start:both.\n\t2.\tWait for both dev servers to start.\n\t3.\tObserve that the second instance fails to load in the browser console with:\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a

The soft keyboard closes and no option is selected. When I click again on the formfield, the dropdown appears again and now I can select and option.

They sometimes have regular, tabbable elements (`<a>`, `<button>`) in their Shadow DOM and participate in the browser tab order as expected.\n\nHowever, the CDK `FocusTrap` machinery and the `_getFirstTabbableElement` / `_getLastTabbableElement` don't quite consider enough of the [sequential focus navigation]. That means that focus trapping in a dialog only works it there's at least one *focusable area* not in a Shadow DOM.\n\nFor performance reason, I don't think it's necessary to build up the full [sequential focus navigation order]. It'd probably be sufficient to use the [`\"DOM\"` selection mechanism](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#selection-mechanism-dom) i.e. find the first/last [suitable sequentially focusable area] element in [shadow including tree order] (host - shadow dom - light dom).\n\n[shadow including tree order]: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-tree-order\n[suitable sequentially focusable area]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#suitable-sequentially-focusable-area\n[sequential navigation search algorithm]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-navigation-search-algorithm\n[sequential focus navigation]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-focus-navigation\n[sequential focus navigation order]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-focus-navigation-order\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-2e9thbl6?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click in the preview window, preferably somewhere in the top part of the red area.\n2. Tab to see the focus (outline) on the button in the red area\n3. Tab to see the focus on the hidden trap element\n4. Tab to see the focus (outline) on the button in the blue area\n5. Keep Tabbing to see the focus actually get trapped\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe focus should remain trapped in the red area\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe focus moves past the red area, to an invisible item and then only gets trapped in the blue area.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19, 20\n- CDK/Material: 19, 20\n- Browser(s): Edge, Firefox\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11 Enterprise\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(a11y): FocusTrap doesn't match browser/spec tab order in relation to Shadow DOM\" (#32265)"},{"Id":"3592944468","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T22:42:50","Actor":"tjshiu","Number":"32263","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): prevent focus on disabled components","State":"closed","Body":"- Whan a component is completely disabled - only the parent component is focusable even when softdisabled=true.

Previously, these post-processing steps were only performed before an upload took place.

This leads to a situation where if those cached rows are later re-used the cells in the row don't match the columns.\n\n\nIt seems like this may be just a matter of clearing the row cache in `_forceRenderDataRows`. This assumes the row elements can't be re-used at all, but that seems to be the current behavior of `_forceRenderDataRows` to re-render everything. It looks like this could be achieved by calling `detach` on the `_RecycleViewRepeaterStrategy` instance in `_forceRenderDataRows`, but it's unclear the semantics of that method since it's not documented in `_ViewRepeater`. `CdkVirtualForOf` only calls it in `ngOnDestroy` and **`CdkTable` never calls it** (probably a separate bug where these row views get leaked when the table gets destroyed).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mssn6jgh?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-table-recycle-rows-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click `Set Short List` to reduce the number of rows to 15 (caching the 10 removed rows).\n2. Then click `Toggle Columns`. This forces a full re-render through `_forceRenderDataRows` (which doesn't populate the cache when removing).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll 15 rows re-render correctly\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen the 15 rows are re-rendered 5 have the old list of 3 columns since they were inserted from the cache and the remaining 10 are new rows and render correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2.4\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.4\n- Browser(s): 141.0.7390.126\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ChromeOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32253","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/table): CdkTable does not handle column updates correctly when using recycleRows\" (#32253)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-09T03:30:02.7515305Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1996}

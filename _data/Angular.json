Another option could be to simply remove the link and only keep the Node.js example. Which solution is preferred?

Hence, everything else from the form up to its container (component, modal, or anything else) are not being garbage collected. Hence, memory is hugely leaking (See image below of nodes piling up).\r\nA very simple sample demo has been uploaded as an example to represent this issue in its minimum expression. It is a very simple two page app: an auth page with a single input field (template driven form) and the explore page to simplify things up. There are 2 buttons inside the auth page; one of them is the submit button of the form. Both buttons navigate to the explore page. (Is done this way to detect the possible issue). \r\nThe explore page has a button to navigate back to the auth page and close the loop. \r\n\r\nTo prove the issue, we navigate back and forth using only the buttons (completely ignoring the input field). \r\nWe just keep routing back and forth pressing the buttons. The result is the expected behaviour where garbage is collected.\r\nThis also proves that the issue is unrelated to the router.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711021-00cb4f00-af2b-11ea-8939-5d23e895b9b3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711492-1f7e1580-af2c-11ea-9abd-87bba4a84baa.png)\r\n\r\nPROBLEM DETECTED:\r\nThe memory leaks bubbles out whenever the form is dirty, in other words, when something is typed in the input field and the form is dirty before navigating. If we navigate back and forth and we keep typing in the simple input field, then the memory leak clarifies.\r\n\r\nFirst Iteration:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711267-8b13b300-af2b-11ea-978f-0b35c11e0a64.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711440-fe1d2980-af2b-11ea-90d7-ff879a1bc94d.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84714593-c1553080-af33-11ea-8fa5-82285e3574ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Iteration:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711378-d037e500-af2b-11ea-93b4-1b88b7bbc366.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84711459-08d7be80-af2c-11ea-9553-91287fab404c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20394220/84714614-cd40f280-af33-11ea-9bd8-391f3bbaf258.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please note that this demo was created solely to describe and mark up this bug behavior. The actions described here may not represent actual practical uses for angular forms.

The compiler has to ability to statically evaluate expressions\r\nthe best it can, but there can be occurrences when an expression cannot be\r\nevaluated statically. For instance, the evaluation could depend on a dynamic\r\nvalue or syntax is used that the compiler does not understand. Alternatively,\r\nit is possible that an expression could be statically evaluated but the\r\nresulting value would be of an incorrect type.\r\n\r\nIn these situations, it would be helpful if the compiler could explain why it\r\nis unable to evaluate an expression. To this extend, the static interpreter\r\nin Ivy keeps track of a trail of `DynamicValue`s which follow the path of nodes\r\nthat were considered all the way to the node that causes an expression to be\r\nconsidered dynamic. Up until this commit, this rich trail of information was\r\nnot surfaced to a developer so the compiler was of little help to explain\r\nwhy static evaluation failed, resulting in situations that are hard to debug\r\nand resolve.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds much more insight to the diagnostic that is produced for static\r\nevaluation errors. For dynamic values, the trail of `DynamicValue` instances\r\nis presented to the user in a meaningful way. If a value is available but not\r\nof the correct type, the type of the resolved value is shown.\r\n\r\nResolves FW-2155\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img width=\"660\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-15 at 13 07 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123679/84651728-bdf97f00-af0a-11ea-89e7-4798da2529e3.png\">\r\n<img width=\"571\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-15 at 13 11 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123679/84651741-c0f46f80-af0a-11ea-9dc1-645ca3eb800c.png\">\r\n<img width=\"574\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-15 at 13 15 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123679/84651739-c05bd900-af0a-11ea-9a00-89a0d5181136.png\">","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37587","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler-cli): explain why an expression cannot be used in AOT compilations\" (#37587)"},{"Id":"638675193","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T09:05:28","Actor":"xiaoxiangmoe","Number":"37585","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support ngc to compile single file","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> This feature request is for @angular/compiler and @angular/compiler-cli?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTypeScript has [transpileModule](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#a-simple-transform-function) to compile single file to js.

Under the hood we use Mitt, but we extend Mitt with additional functionality to match most of the methods that Node’s EventEmitter provides. The following methods have been removed from Puppeteer classes that extend EventEmitter: \n\n-   `eventNames()`\n-   `getMaxListeners()`\n-   `listeners(eventName)`\n-   `prependListener`\n-   `prependOnceListener`\n-   `setMaxListeners(n)`\n-   `rawListeners(eventName)`\n\nAdditionally all the static methods on the EventEmitter class are not supported:\n\n-   `listenerCount(emitter, eventName)`\n-   `defaultMaxListeners`\n-   `errorMonitor`\n\nNode’s EventEmitter emitted a `newListener` event when a listener was added and a `removeListener` event when one was removed. These are not supported and will not be emitted.\n\n#### New features and improvements\n\n-   Send/receive debug logs are now split out into separate channels making the logs much clearer ([#&#8203;6017](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6017))\n-   You can now call `isJavaScriptEnabled()` on a Puppeteer `page` to find out if JS is enabled on the page ([#&#8203;5993](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5993)) \n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n-   Puppeteer is now much better at killing lingering browser processes, especially when you exit a test run with `Ctrl-C` ([#&#8203;6011](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6011))\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   We've started work on a new documentation system that uses TSDoc to generate documentation from our source code and have been porting documentation into code accordingly.\n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`5493494`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5493494) -

We're sorry for causing unexpected issues in the 3.2.0 release. If you were unable to upgrade from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0, you will be able to upgrade straight to 3.3.0 and not have any issues.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The Puppeteer `Response` class was renamed `HTTPResponse` to avoid a clash with the TS `Response` type. We don't expose this class on the main Puppeteer instance so this shouldn't affect any of your code.\n-   Similarly we have renamed `Worker` to `WebWorker` to avoid a clash with the TS `Worker` type. \n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`34c0f9b`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/34c0f9b) - chore: mark version v3.3.0\n[`309d811`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/309d811) - chore: Revert Mitt due to breaking changes ([#&#8203;5952](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5952))\n[`81e3248`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/81e3248) - chore: Defer Windows FF tests for longer ([#&#8203;5954](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5954))\n[`b874cac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b874cac) - chore: rename Worker to WebWorker ([#&#8203;5941](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5941))\n[`7862484`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/7862484) - chore: update request and response references in docs ([#&#8203;5942](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5942))\n[`232def0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/232def0) - chore: rename `Response` to `HTTPResponse` ([#&#8203;5940](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5940))\n[`cfd72ac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/cfd72ac) - chore: bump version to v3.2.0-post ([#&#8203;5938](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5938))\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/v3.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\n-   We now support emulating vision deficiency types within Puppeteer using `page.emulateVisionDeficiency`. You can read more about these [on the DevTools update blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/03/devtools#vision-deficiencies).\n\n-   We now use [Mitt](https://togithub.com/developit/mitt/) as the Event Emitter that backs many of Puppeteer's classes rather than the EventEmitter module that ships with Node. This **is potentially a breaking change if you rely on some of the less popular EventEmitter methods** as Puppeteer's [EventEmitter](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/src/EventEmitter.ts) does not support the entire suite of NodeJS EventEmitter functions. We think it's unlikely anyone has relied on these; we were able to swap out the EventEmitter in Puppeteer without any unit tests needing to change.\n\n-   Puppeteer now recognises webviews as regular pages which means you can control them just like you would control a regular page.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The `Request` class has been renamed to `HTTPRequest` to avoid a clash with TypeScript's `Request` type. We'll be making similar changes to `Response` and `Worker`. This is not a breaking change as Puppeteer doesn't directly expose these classes so you shouldn't be referring to them by name in your code.\n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`1d4d25a`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1d4d25a) -

This functionality is _so_ highly experimental it’s not even documented in the API docs — on purpose! See [this comment](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405#issuecomment-621794572) for instructions on how to try it out. We are hoping to gather feedback on whether this API is useful for you, and how we could improve it. Please [let us know what you think](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405)!\n\n### Behind the scenes\n\n-   `src/` is now 100% TypeScript! This now lays a baseline to start working on improving Puppeteer docs by automatically generating them, shipping type definitions built in (for now we recommend `@types/puppeteer`).\n\n### Raw notes\n\n[`b2488eb`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b2488eb) -

But the wrong http headers information is set (or overwritten) by the information which is set in the sockjs-node. \r\n\r\nMy get call in the service looks like this:\r\n```\r\n  getUsers(): Observable<IUser[]> {\r\n    const url = `${this.backendApiUrl}/api/users`;\r\n    const token = this.authService.getTokenFromLocalStorage();\r\n    console.log('####-user-service', token);\r\n    return this.http.get<IUser[]>(url, {\r\n      headers: new HttpHeaders().set('authtoken', token),\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe token property from local storage is the correct token but the sockjs-node call has a different token and that is applied to my HttpHeader.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nIf you have in the sockjs-node info call the same request header set, this will be transferred to the set Headers in backend call.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nnot authorized because wrong auth token is provided\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.2\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                     6.0.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17938","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"socksjs-node caches old information, setting HTTP Headers fails\" (#17938)"},{"Id":"638919324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T14:55:23","Actor":"clydin","Number":"17937","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions","State":"open","Body":"This adds links to current migration guides for several of the migrations as well as adjusts some of the descriptions to provide additional inline information.\r\n\r\nBlocked on migration guide inclusions:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37512\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37429\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37402","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17937","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions\" (#17937)"},{"Id":"638610335","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T13:17:04","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17936","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to version","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n:wrench: This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Specifically, color support checking is now done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1cd51e64c7331a9cc48d59e8fd6df74d3c6c48f3/packages/angular/cli/utilities/color.ts#L11-L14\r\n\r\nAlas, when node is run within a MINGW terminal (as installed by git for windows), `process.stdout` is a `Socket`, causing `instanceof WriteStream` to return false, and all use of colors by the angular CLI to be disabled, even though the MINGW terminal supports colors just fine ...\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Typings do not contain the function call (added in Node.js v9.9.0)\r\nexport const supportsColor =\r\n  process.stdout instanceof WriteStream\r\n  && ((process.stdout as unknown) as { getColorDepth(): number }).getColorDepth() > 1 \r\n  || process.env.MSYSTEM; // MINGW terminals support color even though nodejs mistakes them for a Socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can submit a PR to that effect.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might prefer to delegate to angular_devkit/core/src/terminal/caps.ts instead, whose vendored implementation of `supportsColor` still contains my earlier fix. However, not knowing your policy for dependencies across npm packages I don't feel comfortable submitting a PR to that effect.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17924","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"webpack output is no longer colored in git bash (again)\" (#17924)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"639264400","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T22:54:56","Actor":"ybarbaria","Number":"19655","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(google-maps): Allow to inject/create/link angular component into MapInfoWindow","State":"closed","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\nI am currently using the agm-snazzy-info-window component which allow to implement any kind of component as info window for a marker.

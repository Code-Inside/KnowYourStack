My issue is described below:\r\n\r\nI am using the `canDeactivate` guard to check if the page has any unsaved changes and showing a popup asking the user to confirm navigation if there are unsaved changes. I am getting the popup only once when the redirection happens from the left navigation menu. But I have a scenario to redirect to the home page when the cancel button is clicked on the page and I am using `router.navigate` to move to the home page. In this case I am getting the confirm popup twice. I enabled tracing in routes and captured the log, I see the following logs:\r\n<img width=\"1686\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97504109/207739531-3a9ba3c9-6ab6-4d36-a32f-daa21e878ccd.png\">\r\n\r\nThe navigation id changes after `ActivationStart` and the event gets cancelled. It initiates the `NavigationStart` event again and this time it works.\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce it with minimal setup on stackblitz but couldn't reproduce it yet.\r\n\r\nAny idea about why the route guard is invoked twice and what causes the navigation id to change when the navigation is in progress?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.3.4\r\nNode: 16.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.4\r\n@angular/cdk                    12.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.4\r\n@angular/elements               13.3.5\r\n@angular/flex-layout            12.0.0-beta.35\r\n@angular/language-service       13.3.5\r\n@angular/localize               13.3.5\r\n@angular/material               12.2.13\r\n@angular/pwa                    0.1102.19\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.4\r\nng-packagr                      13.3.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48499","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Navigation gets cancelled and canDeactivate gets invoked twice when router.navigate is used for redirection\" (#48499)"},{"Id":"1497238004","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-14T23:52:35","Actor":"NexPlex","Number":"48492","RawContent":null,"Title":"ios - safari & chrome - app will not open - unexpected eof on polyfills ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nplatform-browser\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUpdated from Angular 9.1.3 to 14.0.0.

However if you do it again the router nests another named route in the URL instead of recognising it is already active. e.g. (from stackblitz) `/shell/content` -> `/shell/(content//help:content)` -> `/shell/(/(content//help:content)//help:content)` etc. Additionally, navigating to `[routerLink]=\"[{outlets: {help: null}}]\"` doesn't clear the named router outlet.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround if you make the parent of the named outlet have a non-empty path (this is the previously advertised workaround), but this is not unfortunately a satisfactory solution for me. I don't have time right now to bisect and determine when it regressed but will endeaver to do this in the next few days.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dsermn?file=src/app/shell/shell.module.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nAs described above.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n(Locally I'm running this, but it is still present on 15.0.3 as evidenced by the stackblitz repo)\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.9\r\nNode: 16.18.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.9\r\n@angular/material               14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.9\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nPresent on at least Angular 14 & 15.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48472","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bugged named outlet with lazy-loaded module & empty parent route path \" (#48472)"},{"Id":"1494323195","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-13T14:14:56","Actor":"undsoft","Number":"48473","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unexpected behaviour for falsy values when using arrays in class binding","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div \r\n  [class]=\"['as-array', 'as-array2']\" \r\n  [class.specific]=\"true\"\r\n></div>\r\n// Applied: All classes are applied\r\n\r\n<div\r\n  [class]=\"['as-array', '', 'as-array2']\" \r\n  [class.specific]=\"true\"\r\n></div>\r\n// Applied: .specific\r\n\r\n<div \r\n  [class]=\"['as-array', false, 'as-array2']\" \r\n  [class.specific]=\"true\"\r\n></div>\r\n// Applied: .as-array .false .as-array2 .specific\r\n\r\n<div \r\n  [class]=\"['as-array', undefined, 'as-array2']\" \r\n  [class.specific]=\"true\"\r\n></div>\r\n// Applied: .as-array\r\n\r\n<div \r\n  [class]=\"['as-array', null, 'as-array2']\" \r\n  [class.specific]=\"true\"\r\n></div>\r\n// Applied: No classes were applied.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation is basically that falsy values in an array will not be printed and will not affect other class declarations.\r\nBasically I always expect to get `.as-array .as-array2 .specific`.\r\n\r\nI cannot find logic in how it current works.

The intent of the newly-added `--packages=external` setting is to exclude a package's dependencies from the bundle. Since a package's subpath imports are only accessible within that package, it's wrong for them to be affected by `--packages=external`. This release changes esbuild so that `--packages=external` no longer affects subpath imports.\n\n-   Forbid invalid numbers in JSON files\n\n    Previously esbuild parsed numbers in JSON files using the same syntax as JavaScript. But starting from this release, esbuild will now parse them with JSON syntax instead. This means the following numbers are no longer allowed by esbuild in JSON files:\n\n    -   Legacy octal literals (non-zero integers starting with `0`)\n    -   The `0b`, `0o`, and `0x` numeric prefixes\n    -   Numbers containing `_` such as `1_000`\n    -   Leading and trailing `.` such as `0.` and `.0`\n    -   Numbers with a space after the `-` such as `- 1`\n\n-   Add external imports to metafile ([#&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/905), [#&#8203;1768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1768), [#&#8203;1933](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1933), [#&#8203;1939](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1939))\n\n    External imports now appear in `imports` arrays in the metafile (which is present when bundling with `metafile: true`) next to normal imports, but additionally have `external: true` to set them apart. This applies both to files in the `inputs` section and the `outputs` section. Here's an example:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       \"inputs\": {\n         \"style.css\": {\n           \"bytes\": 83,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ]\n         },\n         \"app.js\": {\n           \"bytes\": 100,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-statement\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        },\n             {\n               \"path\": \"style.css\",\n               \"kind\": \"import-statement\"\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       },\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/app.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"require-call\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"exports\": [],\n           \"entryPoint\": \"app.js\",\n           \"cssBundle\": \"out/app.css\",\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"app.js\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 113\n             },\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 528\n         },\n         \"out/app.css\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 100\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    One additional useful consequence of this is that the `imports` array is now populated when bundling is disabled. So you can now use esbuild with bundling disabled to inspect a file's imports.\n\n### [`v0.16.5`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0165)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.4...v0.16.5)\n\n-   Make it easy to exclude all packages from a bundle ([#&#8203;1958](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1958), [#&#8203;1975](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1975), [#&#8203;2164](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2164), [#&#8203;2246](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2246), [#&#8203;2542](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2542))\n\n    When bundling for node, it's often necessary to exclude npm packages from the bundle since they weren't designed with esbuild bundling in mind and don't work correctly after being bundled. For example, they may use `__dirname` and run-time file system calls to load files, which doesn't work after bundling with esbuild. Or they may compile a native `.node` extension that has similar expectations about the layout of the file system that are no longer true after bundling (even if the `.node` extension is copied next to the bundle).\n\n    The way to get this to work with esbuild is to use the `--external:` flag. For example, the [`fsevents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) package contains a native `.node` extension and shouldn't be bundled. To bundle code that uses it, you can pass `--external:fsevents` to esbuild to exclude it from your bundle. You will then need to ensure that the `fsevents` package is still present when you run your bundle (e.g. by publishing your bundle to npm as a package with a dependency on `fsevents`).\n\n    It was possible to automatically do this for all of your dependencies, but it was inconvenient. You had to write some code that read your `package.json` file and passed the keys of the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, and/or `optionalDependencies` maps to esbuild as external packages (either that or write a plugin to mark all package paths as external). Previously esbuild's recommendation for making this easier was to do `--external:./node_modules/*` (added in version 0.14.13). However, this was a bad idea because it caused compatibility problems with many node packages as it caused esbuild to mark the post-resolve path as external instead of the pre-resolve path. Doing that could break packages that are published as both CommonJS and ESM if esbuild's bundler is also used to do a module format conversion.\n\n    With this release, you can now do the following to automatically exclude all packages from your bundle:\n\n    -   CLI:\n\n            esbuild --bundle --packages=external\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        esbuild.build({\n          bundle: true,\n          packages: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          Bundle:   true,\n          Packages: api.PackagesExternal,\n        })\n        ```\n\n    Doing `--external:./node_modules/*` is still possible and still has the same behavior, but is no longer recommended. I recommend that you use the new `packages` feature instead.\n\n-   Fix some subtle bugs with tagged template literals\n\n    This release fixes a bug where minification could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f(x) {\n      let z = y.z\n      return z``\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return y.z``}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return(0,y.z)``}\n    ```\n\n    This release also fixes a bug where using optional chaining with `--target=es2019` or earlier could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj?.foo)``;\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo)``;\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    var __freeze = Object.freeze;\n    var __defProp = Object.defineProperty;\n    var __template = (cooked, raw) => __freeze(__defProp(cooked, \"raw\", { value: __freeze(raw || cooked.slice()) }));\n    var _a;\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo).call(obj, _a || (_a = __template([\"\"])));\n    ```\n\n-   Some slight minification improvements\n\n    The following minification improvements were implemented:\n\n    -   `if (~a !== 0) throw x;` => `if (~a) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a | b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a | b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a & b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a & b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a ^ b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a ^ b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a << b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a << b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >>> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >>> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a || !!b) throw x;` => `if (a || b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a && !!b) throw x;` => `if (a && b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (a ? !!b : !!c) throw x;` => `if (a ? b : c) throw x;`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But when looking at the output, it seems as if the useDefineForClassFields is set to true.\r\n\r\nThis setting causes the following example to be compiled/transpiled incorrectly, causing undefined errors:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass XYZ extends W {\r\nprivate readonly whatever = this.query.watch(\r\n    {},\r\n    {\r\n      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',\r\n    },\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly query: GetSomething\r\n  ) {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar _XYZ = class extends W {\r\n  constructor(query) {\r\n    super();\r\n    __publicField(this, \"query\");\r\n    __publicField(this, \"whatever\", this.query.watch({}, {\r\n      fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n    }));\r\n    this.query = query;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the above example the constructor assignment is done last. I initially thought it was due to esbuild, so I had already opened an issue there which pointed me to the typescript config.

[an additional commit](https://github.com/bravier/browserslist-angular-15-repro/commit/80f47dc221978426a2a4fb876b542418d51d6f40) that adds the `.browserslistrc` file.\r\n\r\nTo compare easily, this other repo is exactly the same but with Angular 14.2.10 and doing the exact same steps show no errors:\r\nhttps://github.com/bravier/browserslist-angular-14-repro\r\n\r\n### Exception or

You can download them here https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable. We use portable versions so that we can have multiple versions of the browser on the system and test several different versions by setting CHROME_BIN.\r\nI am trying to upgrade to angular 14, and I am running into an isssue that is only seen when using a portable version of a browser. When you run ng test, the tests run and when they are done, the browser stays open and the command never finishes. The command we are using is ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browser=chrome. This poses and issue in a CI system that waits for the command to finish.\r\nI am sure that this is just a small thing I am missing in the upgrade... If this was an intentional change, what is the preferred way to test across multiple versions of a browser? Multiple VMs?

It abstracts away most of the gmaps logic that we heavily make use of in our apps.\r\n\r\nBut we're still missing one more functionality, namely an ng-like wrapper around the streetview panorama.\r\n\r\nAn ideal `map-streetview` component could go something like this:\r\n```html\r\n<map-streetview [map]=\"map\"\r\n                [overlays]=\"overlays\"\r\n                [...]=\"otherInputsLikePOVandPositionAndPitch\"\r\n                (pano_changed|position_changed|pov_changed...)=\"myHandler($event)\">\r\n```\r\nThe (optional) `@Input() map` would be the map that [allows binding to external panoramas](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L4210).\r\nThe (optional) `@Input overlays` would [support native gmaps overlays](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview#StreetViewOverlays) but ideally also this package's [`map-marker`](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps/map-marker)s. \r\nThe `@Output`s would be consistent with the standard [streetview events](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview#StreetViewEvents).\r\n\r\nSee section below for more details.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIn order to mirror [`map-marker`](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps/map-marker)s onto the panorama:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9054705/207418752-842ce069-9155-4907-908f-da7a77807c66.png)\r\n\r\nwe have to resort to the native JS API where we take advantage of the fact that `google.maps.Marker` instances get be bound to a `google.maps.StreetViewPanorama` [via `.setMap`](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-types/blob/346f9c9028e92a177cd6a76289e39d7407c99048/index.d.ts#L5138).\r\n\r\nWhen the map markers are dragged, we can listen to the position changes and update the streetview markers' positions accordingly:\r\n```typescript\r\n// keep the map marker and its corresponding panorama marker in sync\r\ngoogle.maps.event.addListener(rawMarker, 'position_changed', () => {\r\n    panoramaMarker.setPosition(rawMarker.getPosition().toJSON());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since we're using `map-markers` (and not the native `google.maps.Marker`s), we have to access the underlying native markers, pass them onto the native streetview and deal with \"component\" lifecycles manually.\r\n\r\nSumming up, it'd be neat to have a `map-streetview` component.\r\nIf it were to support custom overlays such as native markers (or any of the components [in this package](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps) that implement `google.maps.OverlayView`), all the better!\r\n\r\nThoughts?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26255","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(google-maps): Adding a streetview component\" (#26255)"},{"Id":"1494884704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-13T18:10:15","Actor":"parkb83","Number":"26254","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(checkbox): checkbox ripple remains after click","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a checkbox is selected or deselected, the final circular ripple shadow remains on display until something else is clicked.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Here is what happens:\r\n- We have a template for \"no-child menu items\"\r\n- The menu item is created by using `ngTemplateOutlet` when the menu item does not have any child element\r\n- Otherwise, a `button[mat-menu-item]` is created directly\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem, since the `_items` collection of the menu does not contain the elements created from the `ng-template` so the calculated \"padding\" is totally wrong (in our case 200px instead of 8px).\r\n\r\nA possible fix would be that instead of using the first item offset, the style of the first item's parent could be calculated using [window.getComputedStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle), for example.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (see [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-rlxajt?file=src/app/example-component.html)):\r\n\r\n1. Open the main menu\r\n2. Open a submenu (position is off)\r\n\r\nThe stackblitz is greatly simplified.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe appropriate padding should be calculated so the submenu can be shown in the right place.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe submenu is shown in the wrong place\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.2.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome

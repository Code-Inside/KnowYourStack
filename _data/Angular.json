An injectable class can be used as a functional guard using the `inject` function: `resolve: {'user': () => inject(UserResolver).resolve()}`.\r\n\r\nIn Angular 15, there was a **deprecation of class-based Guards and Resolvers**, which has sparked discussions regarding this decision. The deprecation of these interfaces is seen as a regression that goes against established software engineering practices. Some argue that there wasn't sufficient discussion on the topic.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in various posts, including the one at https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47924#issuecomment-1542123337, the removal of these interfaces has negative implications for scalability and opens up Angular to potential misuse and bad practices. This change will likely **result in class-based approaches no longer being a first-choice option for developers** - especially for new developers.\r\n\r\nThe Angular team provided quick polyfills to ensure compatibility with older code as seen at https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47924#issuecomment-1533252207, but this doesn't fully address the primary concerns surrounding this change.\r\n\r\nTo raise awareness and gather feedback from the community, I am opening this issue in the hopes of engaging in a discussion to gain a better understanding of everyone's thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\nCC: @mgechev \r\n\r\nThank you.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50234","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecated/Removed Class-Based Guards and Resolvers\" (#50234)"},{"Id":"1704068493","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T14:34:19","Actor":"laurentgoudet","Number":"50233","RawContent":null,"Title":"Performance issue in Firefox with ng-container inside a <select>","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nplatform-browser\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a list of ~2000 entries (US Universities) in a `<select>` element, with some dynamic filtering done with an `ngIf`. In short the code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <select>\r\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let option of options\">\r\n        <option\r\n          *ngIf=\"true\"\r\n          [ngValue]=\"option.value\"\r\n        >\r\n          {{ option.displayText ?? 'Please select' }}\r\n        </option>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n    </select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works fine in Chrome, this causes Firefox to freeze. Spinning up the Firefox DevTools shows that the native DOM `Node.insertBefore` for each of the 2000 select items take almost 1s, compare to ~300ms in Chrome (x3000 faster).\r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 09 48 12\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/2169585/9e817714-25e8-481f-a9de-f47ce39e7496\">\r\n\r\nChrome:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 09 49 05\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/2169585/8cfa6a87-1889-4f90-8e54-20c2cac52a90\">\r\n\r\nPlaying around with the repro in https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-f1vhwu?file=src%2Fmain.ts shows that removing the `*ngIf` & moving the `*ngFor` to the `<option>` element (aka removing the `<ng-container>`) works around the issue, although in my case I cannot do that (e.g. pre-filter the `options` object) as I use the `*ngIf` to handle select groups/items.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this issue seems to be specific to `<ng-container>`s inside `<select>` elements, as a simple list of `<div>`s load fine in Firefox (https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-akq8zj?file=src/main.ts):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let option of options\">\r\n      <div *ngIf=\"true\">\r\n        {{ option.displayText ?? 'Please select' }}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn short, there seem to be a performance bug specific to Firefox with the way Angular handles `<ng-container>` elements within `<select>`\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-f1vhwu?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nFirefox becomes unresponsive and shows the \"This page is slowing down Firefox..\" banner\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nI'm on v14 but I've upgraded the StackBlitz to latest and it still happens\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nOur CEO happens to be using Firefox 😀","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50233","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance issue in Firefox with ng-container inside a <select>\" (#50233)"},{"Id":"1704027598","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T14:13:16","Actor":"rajeshoodles","Number":"50232","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document is not defined in universal( server side rendering)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThis issue only happens in angular universal( server-side rendering).\r\nIf a **document** is used in the project to communicate with the local storage of the browser and to perform other things.

I am raising my concern to the angular team to give a suitable and stable solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/85736891/a25e6213-1762-4ac0-b461-c6c00104f2ee)\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nReferenceError: document is not defined\r\n    at /home/rajesh/Documents/angular-projects/NowCAST-Web/dist/webview/server/vendor.js:488437:13\r\n    at Module.56601 (/home/rajesh/Documents/angular-projects/NowCAST-Web/dist/webview/server/vendor.js:488446:3)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at Module.12706 (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at Module.76154 (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at Module.34621 (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n    at Module.63370 (../src/app/app.component.scss:68:1)\r\n\r\nA server error has occurred.\r\nnode exited with 1 code.\r\nconnect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:43279\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 16.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.15.0\r\nOS: Linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50232","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Document is not defined in universal( server side rendering)\" (#50232)"},{"Id":"1702872395","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T13:35:03","Actor":"AbdealiLoKo","Number":"50224","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone components loadChildren() not calling canLoad","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMoving this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75098592/whats-the-equivalent-of-canload-guard-for-standalone-components) to the angular tracker.\r\n\r\nI was trying to use standalone components instead of modules based on the \"Virtual NgModule mental model\" described in https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/43784\r\n\r\nI had a module which had just 1 component in it, and decided to replace that with the standalone component instead\r\n\r\nOn doing that, I noticed that the `canLoad` guard was not getting called.\r\nAnd after some searching saw that in the [`loadComponent` PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45705#issue-1210264631) the last point mentioned was:\r\n> CanLoad guards do not apply to loadComponent. canActivate should be used instead, just like you would do if it were simply component instead.\r\n\r\nI could not find this mentioned anywhere in the documentation, I checked:\r\n -

The compiler output has changed in the following ways:\r\n\r\n### Directive handler\r\nThe directive handler now extracts a reference to the input transform function and it resolves the type of its first parameter. It also asserts that the type can be referenced in the compiled output and that it doesn't clash with any pre-existing `ngAcceptInputType_` members.\r\n\r\n### .d.ts\r\nIn the generated declaration files the compiler now inserts an `ngAcceptInputType_` member for each input with a `transform` function. The member's type corresponds to the type of the first parameter of the function, e.g.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// foo.directive.ts\r\n@Directive()\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  @Input({transform: (incomingValue: string) => parseInt(incomingValue)}) value: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// foo.directive.d.ts\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  value: number;\r\n  static ngAcceptInputType_value: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type check block\r\nIf an input has `transform` function, the TCB will use the type of its first parameter for the setter type. This uses the same infrastructure as the `ngAcceptInputType_` members.\r\n\r\n### Directive declaration\r\nThe generated runtime directive declaration call now includes the `transform` function in the `inputs` map, if the input is being transformed. The function will be picked up by the runtime in the next commit to do the actual transformation.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// foo.directive.ts\r\n@Directive()\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  @Input({transform: (incomingValue: string) => parseInt(incomingValue)}) value: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// foo.directive.js\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  ɵdir = ɵɵdefineDirective({\r\n    inputs: {\r\n      value: ['value', 'value', incomingValue => parseInt(incomingValue)]\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50225","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): introduce compiler infrastructure for input transforms\" (#50225)"},{"Id":"1702486352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-09T22:27:57","Actor":"Jun711","Number":"50222","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Pagespeed] How to reduce unused JavaScript in browser.mjs, core.mjs, router.mjs and forms.mjs?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I checked my website speed on https://pagespeed.web.dev/, it gave me a suggestion to reduce unused JavaScript in these Angular files to improve on loading speed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n…node_modules/@angular/animations/fesm2015/browser.mjs | 17.8 KiB | 14.9 KiB\r\n…node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs | 32.8 KiB | 14.1 KiB\r\n…node_modules/@angular/router/fesm2015/router.mjs | 20.1 KiB | 11.0 KiB\r\n…node_modules/@angular/forms/fesm2015/forms.mjs | 13.1 KiB | 9.5 KiB\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall performance score\r\n<img width=\"961\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 10 53 05 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6880939/92977899-c90c-48e0-8546-77e7e6afc4f1\">\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPageSpeed Suggestion \r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 10 30 14 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6880939/5901ebe8-7b70-4808-bac2-9b7e9199a34d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nno idea\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThese modules seem to be needed at the beginning of page load so I can't defer loading them.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50222","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Pagespeed] How to reduce unused JavaScript in browser.mjs, core.mjs, router.mjs and forms.mjs?\" (#50222)"},{"Id":"1701622939","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-09T21:49:32","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50218","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Remove warning for `@Annotation`.","State":"closed","Body":"Per #50206, `@Annotation` is needed for tsickle.

Well, if we comment the subscription to the normal subject (line 40 to 50 in hello.component.ts) and do case 1 again, it somehow does work with runOutsideAngular(). https://stackblitz.com/edit/at-ng-14-router-d9iur8?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhello.component.ts\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    /*this.someService.subject\r\n      .pipe(takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef))\r\n      .subscribe((value) => {\r\n        console.log(value);\r\n\r\n        this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => {\r\n          console.log('Subject ' + value + ' destroyRef');\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        this.letterValue = value;\r\n      });*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Case 4 (Same as Case 1, but with a subscription that is commented out):\r\n\r\n- Toggle Child\r\n- Toggle Child again\r\n\r\n### Expected onDestroy callbacks to have been called:\r\n- 1, 2, 4, 5?, 6\r\n\r\n### Actual callbacks called\r\n- 2, 4, 5, 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis all seems very inconsistent. As stated before, we ran into bugs where takeUntilDestroyed() didn't work at all when used on observables within ngOnit directly (with destroyRef supplied, of course) and it wouldn't unsubscribe from all observables. Sadly I've not been able to reproduce this in a simple example yet, but this makes this new feature quite unusable. I'll keep you updated if I manage to craft a minimal reproduction for that bug as well.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/at-ng-14-router-aoffwi?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhello.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 16.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Erratic behavior with DestroyRef, not all callbacks are always being called upon component destruction.\" (#50221)"},{"Id":"1701755797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-09T16:30:41","Actor":"dondelice257","Number":"50220","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update ng_model.ts","State":"closed","Body":"I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST ON THE ngModel directive to do a little lazy while changing the value in ngModel, so that the value in ngModel should be changed other where on focus out Thank you\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [x] Other...

glob proxy entries for esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"When using the esbuild-based browser application builder with the development server, an underlying Vite server is used. The Vite server currently does not support glob-based entries for the proxy configuration. They must either be prefix strings or regular expressions. The Webpack-based development server, however, does support globs. To remove the need to have different proxy configuration files for the two servers, the entries will now be normalized to regular expressions when using the Vite server. This allows existing proxy configurations to work without modification.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 892fcc6892acbc4e951be9afd5e00d501899e09c)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25166","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): convert dev-server glob proxy entries for esbuild builder\" (#25166)"},{"Id":"1698451258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-08T15:50:28","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25154","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | patch | `v1.31.0` -> `v1.31.1` |\n| [eslint](https://eslint.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.39.0` -> `8.40.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint/8.39.0/8.40.0) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.17.1` -> `5.17.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.17.1/5.17.2) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.17.1` -> `5.17.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.17.1/5.17.2) |\n| [vite](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite)) | dependencies | patch | [`4.3.4` -> `4.3.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/4.3.4/4.3.5) |\n| [vite](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.3.4` -> `4.3.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/4.3.4/4.3.5) |\n| [webpack-dev-server](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) | dependencies | minor | [`4.13.3` -> `4.15.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-dev-server/4.13.3/4.15.0) |\n| [webpack-dev-server](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) | devDependencies | minor | [`4.13.3` -> `4.15.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-dev-server/4.13.3/4.15.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/bazel-lib</summary>\n\n### [`v1.31.1`](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases/tag/v1.31.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v1.31.0...v1.31.1)\n\nNote: release notes for v1.31.0 were removed, as the change to `DEFAULT_YQ_VERSION` was more breaking than we realized, and not meeting our semver guarantee.\nPlease do not use that release.\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\n1.

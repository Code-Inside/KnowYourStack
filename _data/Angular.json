(An example of this would be having a dashboard that's protected by a user login guard that redirects to the login page (which in my case is lazy-loaded).)\r\n\r\nThis is further an issue because it changes the history so that if the user hits the back button, they will be taken to `/` rather than the page they originally tried to navigate to.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there is a network issue retrieving the module, the user will be abandoned on the home page. If they refresh to try to fix the issue, they will no longer be where they started.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[angular-lazy-load-guard-test.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular/files/4363701/angular-lazy-load-guard-test.zip)\r\n\r\nNavigate to `/page1` and you should get redirected to `/page2`. However, notice that the URL briefly reads `/`. If this is not apparent, try adding network throttling (a Firefox feature) to slow down the retrieval of the lazy module.\r\n\r\nI also have a second redirect that emulates the behavior of the guard in the Page1Component. If you disable the card, the page1 component will still redirect. *However*, note that the URL never reads blank at this point...it always shows something. \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.7\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36187","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Navigating to lazy loaded module from route guard causes the URL path to briefly be blank\" (#36187)"},{"Id":"585551858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-21T18:30:49","Actor":"yr377","Number":"36186","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inconsistent v9.0.7 that caused the warnings to ng2-charts and fsevents","State":"closed","Body":"Angular CLI: 9.0.7\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.7\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.1.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.29\r\n@angular/material                 9.1.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n>>>\r\n\r\nnpm WARN **ng2-charts@2.3.0** requires a peer of @angular/common@^7.2.0 || ^8.0.0 but none is installed.

If you try the steps to reproduce in Chrome or Edge, you will only get a message saying 'button focused'.\r\n\r\nVery important detail: this behavior only occurs in the following template setup:\r\n```\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"modalActivated === true\">\r\n    <div @popoverAnimations>\r\n        <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"popoverContent\"></ng-container>\r\n    </div>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #popoverContent>\r\n    <button #example (focus)=\"onFocus()\" (blur)=\"onBlur()\">Just a button</button>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you need:\r\n\r\n1. A parent ng-container using an *ngIf to determine whether to display\r\n2. A child element using an animation\r\n3. A child ng-container receiving an ngTemplateOutlet\r\n\r\nThen if a ViewChild is used to focus on the button in IE11, you will get an extra blur and another focus. Taking away any of those three factors removes the ability to reproduce the issue.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36175","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IE11 only: blur and multiple focus events sent for animated elements' children\" (#36175)"},{"Id":"585307653","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-20T20:22:19","Actor":"acohenOT","Number":"36173","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked.

The default value of this option is false.\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI creates an instance of the AngularCompilerPlugin and sets this option to true, with no way of overriding this behavior.\r\n\r\nSetting this to true made sense when there was no way to customize the webpack config. However, now that CLI Builders are officially supported, it will become more common for builders like @angular-builders/custom-webpack to be used to customize the webpack configuration. But with directTemplateLoading being hard-coded to true, there is no way to customize the webpack configuration to allow a loader to manipulate a component's template.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nLet the directTemplateLoading option be set in the angular.json file.

There might be however a way to configure i18n framework somehow to omit it.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPrior to angular v9, localization did not impact the `baseHref`. Currently, such a tag is always added to the `index.html`. \r\n```html\r\n<base href=\"...\"/>\r\n```\r\nPreviously we did not use it at all to easily allow deploying the application on sub-paths, such as `example.com/kubernetes-dashboard`. This worked without any issues. Right now it will not work due to this tag which we cannot omit.\r\n\r\nWe want the localized build to be selected by the backend based on `Accept-Language` header instead of `/<locale-code>` path. That's why our requirement is to have all requests coming from the same base path.\r\n\r\nThis is our [angular.json](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/angular.json#L11). Right now, it has to define `/` as `baseHref` to avoid `/<locale-code>` path logic.\r\n\r\nConfiguring dynamic `baseHref` based on a path is not an option right now as any changes to `base` tag in `index.html` are overridden during the build.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to avoid adding `base` tag during the build, but still build localized version of the application, or somehow make `baseHref` build final path as a relative path and not as an absolute path?\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.6\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.6\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.6\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.29\r\n@angular/http                     8.0.0-beta.10+1.sha-a28b3e3\r\n@angular/language-service         9.0.6\r\n@angular/localize                 9.0.6\r\n@angular/material                 9.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.6\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17260","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Base href overridden by locale config\" (#17260)"},{"Id":"584952936","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-20T09:49:02","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17259","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): display post migration message when updating from …","State":"open","Body":"…previous major version\r\n\r\nFixes #17256","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17259","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular/cli): display post migration message when updating from …\" (#17259)"},{"Id":"584769033","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-20T07:51:38","Actor":"OscarTorresJ","Number":"17258","RawContent":null,"Title":"IBANKING","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n\r\nPlease file any Angular Material issues at: https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/new\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we keep Angular Material issues in a separate repository.\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17258","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"IBANKING\" (#17258)"},{"Id":"584565101","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T20:28:11","Actor":"OrangeDog","Number":"17257","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot avoid inline styles for CSP","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

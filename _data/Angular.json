These trailing spaces are not desirable, since they will later be converted into `_` symbols while normalizing placeholder names, thus causing mismatches at runtime (i.e. placeholder will not be replaced with the correct value). This commit updates the code to trim these spaces while generating an object with placeholders, to make sure the runtime logic can replace these placeholders with the right values.\r\n\r\nAnother approach that I was considering is to trim these spaces at the Lexer level, but that would be a big breaking change affecting a portion of apps due to the fact that i18n message ids would be changed in this case.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37866","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): handle spaces after `select` and `plural` ICU keywords\" (#37866)"},{"Id":"648536060","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T22:28:31","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"37865","RawContent":null,"Title":"Commit body is calculated incorrectly in some cases","State":"open","Body":"While investigating the problem with `docs` scope exclusion from min body length checks (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37862), I noticed that the commit body that we use for length check also includes the content that would be dropped after the commit is made.

For example, have a component tree with `color: 'BLUE` injected, and another component tree with `color: 'RED'` injected.\r\n\r\nThis sort of desire comes up in a lot of different forms. Sometimes the component tree exist contemporaneously; other times they don't (e.g. router-like functionality).\r\n\r\nThe point of dependency injection is to not code against fixed values, however Angular's DI currently makes it cumbersome to adjust the injector.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSpecify the injector when creating the component. Example syntax:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class RootComponent {\r\n  constructor(private readonly injector: Injector) {}\r\n  readonly blueProviders: StaticProviders[] = [{ provide: COLOR, useValue: 'BLUE' }];\r\n  readonly blueInjector = Injector.create(this.blueProviders, this.injector);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<my-component [@injector]=\"blueInjector\"></my-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<my-component [@providers]=\"blueProviders\"></my-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1. Inject an `Observable`. However that complicates client code, and requires components to understand how to handle changes.\r\n\r\n2. Use non-template code to dynamically create components. However, lifecycles methods, etc. make the approach complex in general.\r\n\r\n3. Use `*ngComponentOutlet`. However, like (2), that removes the ability to use inputs with the child component, and it requires explicitly adding components to module entry points.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37857","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Choose injector when creating components\" (#37857)"},{"Id":"648465764","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T20:19:26","Actor":"GlauberF","Number":"37856","RawContent":null,"Title":"UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: spawn ENOMEM","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n@angular/*\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nwhen running the command `node --max_old_space_size=6144 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve --open` I get an error.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n(node:7700) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: spawn ENOMEM\r\n    at ChildProcess.spawn (internal/child_process.js:407:11)\r\n    at Object.spawn (child_process.js:548:9)\r\n    at module.exports (/var/www/html/pwa_vimbo/node_modules/open/index.js:144:34)\r\n(node:7700) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection.

This involves retaining references\r\nto instances from prior compilations, which must be done carefully to avoid\r\nmemory leaks.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes such a leak with a complicated retention chain:\r\n\r\n* `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` unnecessarily hangs on to the previous\r\n  `IncrementalDriver` (state of the previous compilation) once the current\r\n  compilation completes.\r\n\r\n  In general this is unnecessary, but should be safe as long as the chain\r\n  only goes back one level - if the `IncrementalDriver` doesn't retain any\r\n  previous `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` instances. However, this does\r\n  happen:\r\n\r\n* `NgCompiler` indirectly causes retention of previous `NgCompiler`\r\n  instances (and thus previous `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` instances)\r\n  through accidental capture of the `this` context in a closure created in\r\n  its constructor. This closure is wrapped in a `ts.ModuleResolutionCache`\r\n  used to create a `ModuleResolver` class, which is passed to the program's\r\n  `TraitCompiler` on construction.\r\n\r\n* The `IncrementalDriver` retains a reference to the `TraitCompiler` of the\r\n  previous compilation, completing the reference chain.\r\n\r\nThe final retention chain thus looks like:\r\n\r\n* `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` of current program\r\n* `.previous`: `IncrementalDriver` of previous program\r\n* `.lastGood.traitCompiler`: `TraitCompiler`\r\n* `.handlers[..].moduleResolver.moduleResolutionCache`: cache\r\n* (via `getCanonicalFileName` closure): `NgCompiler`\r\n* `.incrementalStrategy`:`TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` of previous \r\n  program.\r\n\r\nThe closure link is the \"real\" leak here. `NgCompiler` is creating a closure\r\nfor `getCanonicalFileName`, delegating to its\r\n`this.adapter.getCanonicalFileName`, for the purposes of creating a\r\n`ts.ModuleResolutionCache`. Since this cache appears to be retained in\r\nTypeScript internals, the fact that the closure references `NgCompiler`\r\ncauses previous `NgCompiler` iterations to be retained.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the first two links in the retention chain: the build\r\nstrategy is patched to not retain a `previous` pointer, and the `NgCompiler`\r\nis patched to not create a closure in the first place, but instead pass a\r\nbound function. This ensures that the `NgCompiler` does not retain previous\r\ninstances of itself in the first place, even if the build strategy does\r\nend up retaining the previous incremental state unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe third link (`IncrementalDriver` unnecessarily retaining the whole\r\n`TraitCompiler`) is not addressed in this commit as it's a more\r\narchitectural problem that will require some refactoring. However, the leak\r\npotential of this retention is eliminated thanks to fixing the first two\r\nissues.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(compiler-cli): fix memory leak in retained incremental state\" (#37835)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"648678122","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-01T05:12:56","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18092","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update source-map-loader to version 1.0.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [source-map-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader) | dependencies | patch | [`1.0.0` -> `1.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/source-map-loader/1.0.0/1.0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/source-map-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v1.0.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;101-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribsource-map-loadercomparev100v101-2020-06-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Thank you for getting back to us with the requested information. I am glad to assist you further.\r\n\r\nBefore I commence, I would like to apologise for the delayed response. As I was replicating the issue in my environment, it took me a while to get back to you. I hope that you understand it and co-operate with me.\r\n\r\nInvestigation made -\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nInitially I have thoroughly gone through the \"verbose\" log you have sent me on the case. However, even in the verbose logs, I was unable to observe any particular error messages. Later, I have made use of the \"package.json\" file to install the same dependencies which you are using to test the build.\r\n\r\nI installed the dependencies and used them in the CodeBuild environment to build a sample application. To replicate the issue exactly, I have made use of the same compute type and compute environment in the codebuild project that you are making use of. The environment information where I have tested the sample application is given below. However, the issue was not reproduce-able in my environment.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\ntype \t                            LINUX_CONTAINER\r\nimage \t                          aws/codebuild/standard:3.0\r\ncomputeType \t                    BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM\r\nprivilegedMode \t                  false\r\ncertificate \t                    blank\r\nregistryCredential \t              blank\r\nimagePullCredentialsType \t        CODEBUILD\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLater, As my area of expertise is AWS CodeBuild, to gain more understanding about the Angular CLI and \"ng build\" I have gone through the Angular documentations. After that, to check if there are any existing issues in the angular CLI, I checked all the existing Git issues of the Angular CLI. I found the actual issue on git where, the \"ng build\" just fails without any particular reason. Below is the link to the issue description.\r\n\r\nErrors in child compilers not reported, process exits without info #17565 - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17565 \r\n\r\nThe issue affects \"ng build\" and \"ng serve\" commands. Accordingly, If a compilation includes child compilations as is the case when using worker-loader for example (or many other webpack loaders/plugins) the build process can fail and exit without providing any info but the exit code being 1.\r\n\r\nThe replication steps for this error with the replication repository is given in the issue description itself. I have tried this both in my local environment and in CodeBuild as well.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried in the Local machine the build looks like completed as the error is not visible in the console. The local build output which I ran is given below:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n8c859032105a:angular-child-compiler-error user$  node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --prod\r\nBrowserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated.

However, the exit code of the command is 1. This can be the reason that the Build looks like working fine when it ran Locally in your case as well.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the issue in CodeBuild environment, I have made use of the below buildspec file and the replication was successful. You can use this buildspec for the further replication on you end.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nversion: 0.2\r\n\r\nphases:\r\n  build:\r\n    commands:\r\n       - git init\r\n       - git clone https://github.com/nadavsinai/angular-child-compiler-error.git \r\n       - cd angular-child-compiler-error\r\n       - npm install\r\n       - node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --prod --verbose\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI have also tried with the angularcli vesrion 8.0.6 and 8.0.3 which is running in your environment. This version also has the same issue and the error is reproduce-able.\r\n\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the issue seems more specific to the anularcli and application you are building rather than the CodeBuild environment. As I have just started with the Angular and My area of expertise is AWS CodeBuild, I may not able to debug the reason for the error. However, we can be sure that AWS CodeBuild is not having any direct relation with the issue we are observing. Rather, the issue is specific to angular and how it handles the compilation which includes child compilations. I hope that you understand this.\r\n\"\"\"\"\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nCommand did not exit successfully node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --prod exit status 1\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.3\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.3\r\n@angular/material                 8.0.1\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.901.6\r\n@angular/service-worker           8.0.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.3\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18080","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ng build fails always using aws codebuild  \" (#18080)"},{"Id":"647706001","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T17:25:37","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"18071","RawContent":null,"Title":"Skeleton app is broken during testing","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I run `ng test` in a newly created Angular application, the `title` binding and the **Terminal** commands are not displayed.

My system has 16GB of RAM and it is exhausting all of it. upon further inspection I found that we have a few extra License.txt files for a few modules. so I tried experimenting with `extractLicense: false`, so the License.txt files of those modules still remains but there was no 3rdpartylicense.txt file but the memory leak was fixed. I suspect there is a memory leak while trying to extract the licenses.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nNot available.

With Angular v9.1.11 and youtube-player v9.2.4, the \"ready\" event is no longer emitted.\r\n\r\nHere is a Stackblitz link for an example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-youtube-player-example-6rrcta\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the file `/src/app/video/video.component.ts` in the provided Stackblitz link, and observe that the “ready” event is configured to call the showready() method, which should log to the console the message “I am ready” as soon as the youtube player loads (i.e. when the page loads).\r\n2. Open the developer tools in your web browser, and open the console.\r\n3. Reload the Stackblitz link.\r\n4. Observe that no message “I am ready” is displayed in the console, hence proving that the “ready” event is not being sent or captured.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior was that the message \"I am ready\" was supposed to show in the console, proving that the \"ready\" even was being sent or captured correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe behavior seen in the provided example is that the \"ready\" event is not being sent or captured.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.1.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 83.0.4103.116 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS Catalina 10.15.3\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19788","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(youtube-player): the \"ready\" event is not sent or captured when the youtube player is done loading\" (#19788)"},{"Id":"646863485","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-28T07:42:15","Actor":"Ritesh-Swarnakar","Number":"19789","RawContent":null,"Title":"Import error, can't find file: ./services/services.component when testing file in stackblitz.com","State":"open","Body":"How to solve this issue.

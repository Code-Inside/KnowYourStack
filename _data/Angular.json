This can happen when an input has a getter/setter pair\r\nwhere the getter always returns a narrow type, and the setter coerces a\r\nwider value down to the narrow type.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could imagine an input of the form:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Input() get value(): string {\r\n  return this._value;\r\n}\r\n\r\nset value(v: {toString(): string}) {\r\n  this._value = v.toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the getter always returns a `string`, but the setter accepts any value\r\nthat can be `toString()`'d, and coerces it to a string.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately TypeScript does not actually support this syntax, and so\r\nAngular users are forced to type their setters as narrowly as the getters,\r\neven though at runtime the coercion works just fine.\r\n\r\nTo support these kinds of patterns (e.g. as used by Material), this commit\r\nadds a compiler feature called \"input coercion\". When a binding is made to\r\nthe 'value' input of a directive like MatInput, the compiler will look for a\r\nstatic function with the name ngCoerceInput_value. If such a function is\r\nfound, the type-checking expression for the input will be wrapped in a call\r\nto the function, allowing for the expression of a type conversion between\r\nthe binding expression and the value being written to the input's field.\r\n\r\nTo solve the case above, for example, MatInput might write:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass MatInput {\r\n  // rest of the directive...\r\n\r\n  static ngCoerceInput_value(value: {toString(): string}): string {\r\n    return null!;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFW-1475 #resolve\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33243","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): input type coercion for template type-checking\" (#33243)"},{"Id":"508541545","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T22:46:03","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"33226","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove vendored Babel typings","State":"closed","Body":"## Second attempt after previous PR was reverted (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33176)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were getting included in the @angular/localize package.\r\nInstead, patch the upstream files to work with TS typeRoots option\r\n\r\nSee bazelbuild/rules_nodejs#1033\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: remove vendored Babel typings\" (#33226)"},{"Id":"508755715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T22:38:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"33242","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): remove unused CLI private exports","State":"open","Body":"These exports are no longer used by the CLI since version 7.1.0.

If the data contains a fragment, we'd expect to be able to scroll to it. However it does not work on initial navigation. A [common](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48141804/angular-2-routing-with-fragments-async-data), but wrong, idea is to use a Resolver for async data shown on a page. However if the data is asynchronous then it is also conditional. Thus there is no way to implement functional anchor scrolling from Angular Router with any type of dynamic data in a component.\r\n\r\nAlso of note, once the component fully loads, anchor scrolling does work. For example if you had an anchor tag with a router link to a fragment on the same page, it will work. It will also work when navigating back to a page that is already loaded.\r\n\r\nTested in Chrome and Firefox","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Anchor Scrolling does not work with fragment in conditional template even when condition is always true\" (#33240)"},{"Id":"508751494","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T22:24:59","Actor":"animnook","Number":"33239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Top Menu highlight wrong item after click on browser back button","State":"open","Body":"# 📚 angular.io bug\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n1.

This can lead to a race condition, where both check for the directory existence, see that the directory does not exist and both try to create it, with the second failing due the directory's having already been created by the first one. Note that this only affects directories and not files, because `ngcc` tasks operate on different sets of files.\r\n\r\nThis commit avoids this race condition by allowing `FileSystem`'s `ensureDir()` method to not fail if one of the directories it is trying to create already exists (and is indeed a directory). This is fine for\r\nthe `ensureDir()` method, since it's purpose is to ensure that the specified directory exists. So, even if the `mkdir()` call failed (because the directory exists), `ensureDir()` has still completed its mission.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33049#issuecomment-540485703\r\n[FW-1635](https://angular-team.atlassian.net/browse/FW-1635) #resolve\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33237","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ngcc): do not fail when multiple workers try to create the same directory\" (#33237)"},{"Id":"508706299","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T20:33:35","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"33235","RawContent":null,"Title":"Recursive change detection","State":"open","Body":"\r\n```\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────┐\r\n│              (index)               │  time   │ unit │ base_time │ base_unit │   %   │\r\n├────────────────────────────────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────┤\r\n│       directive_instantiate        │  2.427  │ 'us' │   2.483   │   'us'    │ -2.26 │\r\n│        element_text_create         │  1.266  │ 'us' │   1.278   │   'us'    │ -0.94 │\r\n│           interpolation            │ 213.588 │ 'us' │  216.65   │   'us'    │ -1.41 │\r\n│             listeners              │  1.921  │ 'us' │   1.952   │   'us'    │ -1.59 │\r\n│ map_based_style_and_class_bindings │ 18.211  │ 'ms' │  17.983   │   'ms'    │ 1.27  │\r\n│       noop_change_detection        │  24.99  │ 'us' │   23.96   │   'us'    │  4.3  │\r\n│          property_binding          │ 220.944 │ 'us' │  219.963  │   'us'    │ 0.45  │\r\n│      property_binding_update       │ 442.284 │ 'us' │  408.865  │   'us'    │ 8.17  │\r\n│      style_and_class_bindings      │  1.023  │ 'ms' │  990.402  │   'us'    │ 3.29  │\r\n│           style_binding            │ 443.163 │ 'us' │  489.636  │   'us'    │ -9.49 │\r\n└────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────┘\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33235","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Recursive change detection\" (#33235)"},{"Id":"508657914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T18:50:56","Actor":"AMDphreak","Number":"33234","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: change \"comprises\" to \"consists of\" in getting started","State":"open","Body":"per Google Guidelines.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The [default value](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/compiler_host.ts#L48) of this option is `false`.\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI creates an instance of the `AngularCompilerPlugin` and sets this option to `true`, with no way of overriding this behavior.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L94\r\n\r\nSetting this to `true` made sense when there was no way to customize the webpack config. However, now that CLI Builders are [officially supported](https://blog.angular.io/introducing-cli-builders-d012d4489f1b), it will become more common for builders like [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack) to be used to customize the webpack configuration. But with `directTemplateLoading` being hard-coded to `true`, there is no way to customize the webpack configuration to allow a loader to manipulate a component's template.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nLet the `directTemplateLoading` option be set in the `angular.json` file. For example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"architect\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"directTemplateLoading\": false,\r\n      \"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./webpack.config.js\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"etc\": \"etc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThis idea has been raised before in a couple of issues, but both were closed with workarounds or hacks. Since CLI Builders are now officially supported, I feel that a proper solution is required.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` and inline loaders\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14855#issuecomment-510592634 suggests using `template` and specifying the loaders in the require statement instead of using `templateUrl`.\r\n\r\n> Hi all, we had a chat around this, and we think that if you want to use webpack specific stuff you can use [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) or otherwise you can update the require statements to include the raw-loader import syntax ie: `require('!raw-loader!./path-to-template.html')` as suggested above.\r\n\r\nManually specifying the same loaders for _every_ component template is not maintainable.\r\n\r\n#### Hack the webpack config\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14534#issuecomment-496666971 states that a hack is required to set `directTemplateLoading`:\r\n\r\n> Closing as the above method is a necessary step to augment an existing plugin within a webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nThe \"above method\" is to search through the plugins in the webpack config and find the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, get it's options, change the `directTemplateLoading` value to false, create a new instance of the plugin with the modified options and replace the original plugin in the webpack config. Very hacky.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` with loaders in the webpack config\r\n\r\nSimilar to the outcome of #14855, you can:\r\n\r\n1. Install `@types/node`.\r\n2. Add `\"node\"` to the `types` property of the tsconfig file.\r\n3. Change `templateUrl: './foo.component.html` to `template: require('./foo.component.html')`\r\n\r\nand the custom loaders specified in the webpack config will be used. _But_ this requires you to make changes to the way the component's template is specified by default, which is easy to forget to do. That's just asking for problems because forgetting to change `templateUrl` to `template` means it won't be passed through the custom loaders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the Angular Language Service complains that _\"Component 'FooComponent' must have a template or templateUrl\"_.  \r\n\r\nGiven the choice between this and hacking the webpack config to recreate the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, I'd choose hacking the webpack config. 😁 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15861","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow directTemplateLoading to be set from angular.json\" (#15861)"},{"Id":"508538465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15866","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null","State":"closed","Body":"It should be undefined instead: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cd7b1992193be85f3317a4ef793b13c03ac2b215/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/program.ts#L161\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15866","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null\" (#15866)"},{"Id":"507895035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15857","RawContent":null,"Title":"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error","State":"closed","Body":"This should really be using Ivy but was getting the error below on every second build.\r\n`ERROR in Cannot read property 'incrementalState' of null`\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15847/commits/0a4dd9b209cbaaaabbe25bc09cb538948fa4b148","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error\" (#15857)"},{"Id":"508528782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:55:57","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15864","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add jit-prod e2e","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15864","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: add jit-prod e2e\" (#15864)"},{"Id":"507356555","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:55:01","Actor":"hhsissi","Number":"15849","RawContent":null,"Title":"HMR The missing documentation","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nToday, the only docs available for using the Hot Module Replacement with Angular are:\r\n1- https://github.com/PatrickJS/angular-hmr (Last commit from Aug 2018) (thanks to the guy for his great job by the way).\r\n2- Really not helpful => \r\n\r\nng serve --hmr\r\nNOTICE: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled for the dev server.\r\nThe project will still live reload when HMR is enabled,\r\nbut to take advantage of HMR additional application code is required'\r\n(not included in an Angular CLI project by default).'\r\nSee https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement\r\nfor information on working with HMR for Webpack.\r\nTo disable this warning use \"hmrWarning: false\" under \"serve\" options in \"angular.json\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem here is => Webpack documentation show you how to configure your webpack to use HMR, and not how to configure Angular to get HMR working.\r\n\r\nIf someone could provide a sample code for HMR integration with Angular, Please do so, I would really be grateful (and a bunch of people I believe).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15849","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HMR The missing documentation\" (#15849)"},{"Id":"508261344","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:44:06","Actor":"Mobitelnoc","Number":"15859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\nAngular new project creating error occurred.\r\n[2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/3737643/2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log)\r\n\r\nPlease file any Docs or angular.io issues at: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we keep Angular AIO issues in a separate repository.\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15859","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules\" (#15859)"},{"Id":"508542636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T15:08:30","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"15867","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): remove unneeded debugElement in test","State":"open","Body":"The generate tests in `app.component.spec.ts` are using `fixture.debugElement.componentInstance` whereas we can directly use `fixture.componentInstance`.

(Angular 7 + Node 8 + window10)\r\n\r\nI found this function in webpack config utility: (node_modules\\@angular-devkit\\build-angular\\src\\angular-cli-files\\models\\webpack-configs\\utils.js)\r\n`function getSourceMapDevTool\r\n    ...............\r\n    \r\n    return new webpack_1.SourceMapDevToolPlugin({\r\n        filename: inlineSourceMap ? undefined : '[file].map',\r\n        include,\r\n        exclude: ['vendor.js'],    **<----  Here, I excluded vendor.js and the issue gone. Build speed is much faster and it almost did not affect daily debugging!**\r\n        append: hiddenSourceMap ? false : undefined,\r\n    });\r\n`\r\n\r\nI noticed that there is a configuration in \"angular.json\" [\"sourceMap\"](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#optimization-and-source-map-configuration) under architect->build->option;\r\nCould you guys please add an \"exclude\" param in that object? So that specified file could be excluded by us individually. If you can add that function, that might help a lot of people. Thank you! \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoey","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15862","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add param in config to exclude files to help to solve the \"heap out of memory\" issue\" (#15862)"},{"Id":"508354022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T09:34:32","Actor":"linwrui","Number":"15860","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve warning: WARNING in Circular dependency detected","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: \r\n\"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.801.2\",\r\n\"@angular/cli\": \"~8.1.2\",\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nI upgrade angular with command 'ng update @angular/core @angular/cli',and the angular package all upgrade automatically.After upgrade success,I run command 'ng serve'.And the console log many wanings like ' WARNING in Circular dependency detected'.But angular.json only provide 'showCircularDependencies' on ng-build options.So how can I ignore the circular warning when I run 'ng serve'?\r\nI think this is a bug cause it dosen't happened on angluar/cli v8.1.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"~8.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/flex-layout\": \"^8.0.0-beta.26\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-server\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"~8.2.11\",\r\n    \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\": \"^8.1.0\",\r\n    \"@angular-builders/dev-server\": \"~7.3.1\",\r\n    \"@angular-builders/jest\": \"^8.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.803.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~8.3.10\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.4.5\",\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Adds the @angular/service-worker package to your project.\r\n2. Enables service worker build support in the CLI.\r\n3. Imports and registers the service worker in the app module.\r\n4. Updates the index.html file:\r\n5. Includes a link to add the manifest.json file.\r\n6. Adds meta tags for theme-color.\r\n7. Installs icon files to support the installed Progressive Web App (PWA).\r\n8. Creates the service worker configuration file called ngsw-config.json, which specifies the caching behaviors and other settings.\r\n\r\nHowever on step 7, adding the icons files these are generic default Angular icons. In order to replace these developers then need to manually:\r\n\r\n1. Find an icon generator\r\n2. Upload their image and generate the new code\r\n3. Download the icons copy/paste into the folder\r\n4. Copy/paste the icons code into the index.html head tag\r\n\r\nEvery developer needs to do these steps on every new project. So it would save alot of time if we had an automated solution.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe option to include my HQ image file for the icon, which is automatically converted into the various sizes and added used instead of the default Angular icon.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nConsider using a webpack plugin or node.js script to generate the icons for us?\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\nhttps://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin\r\nhttps://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate favicon as part of adding PWA service worker\" (#15844)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"507532247","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T22:56:07","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"17417","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/tabs/testing): polish harness API","State":"closed","Body":"- Add `label` filter for `MatTabHarness`\r\n- Add ability to filter returned harnesses in `MatTabGroupHarness#getTabs`\r\n- Add a method for selecting a child tab to the `MatTabGroupHarness`\r\n- Remove `getContentElement` and replace it with `getHarnessLoaderForContent`\r\n\r\n@jelbourn @devversion Curious about your opinions: My reason for removing `getContentElement` is that I want to avoid returning `TestElement` objects from our harnesses. I don't think they're particularly useful to test authors, and instead we probably want APIs that are more focused in purpose. I do think it makes sense, however, to allow users to get some handle on the content. I think the thing users are most likely to do with the content element is either query for more harnesses within it, or query outside of the harness system (e.g. `document.querySelector`). I settled on returning a selector because it allows the user to do either of those things. Another option would be to provide a method for loading a sub-harness directly (they pass the harness class and we return an instance). We either could provide this method instead of or in addition to the `getSelectorForContent` method.\r\n\r\n**Update:** Changed `getSelectorForContent` to `getHarnessLoaderForContent`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17417","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/tabs/testing): polish harness API\" (#17417)"},{"Id":"508734509","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T21:39:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"17439","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(form-field): ensure that descendants are picked up in Ivy","State":"open","Body":"Since there's a slight difference in how `ContentChildren` works in Ivy, these changes add the `descendants` flag explicitly to ensure that we pick up all of the relevant elements.

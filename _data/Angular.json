While `takeUntil` can be safely called once the view is destroyed—resulting in no errors and finalizing the subscription depending on whether a subject or replay subject is used—replacing it with `takeUntilDestroyed` introduces a breaking change, as it throws an error if the `lView` is destroyed.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: #54527\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58008","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): call `DestroyRef` on destroy callback if view is destroyed\" (#58008)"},{"Id":"2554481428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-28T20:21:45","Actor":"DavAlbert","Number":"58005","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"Easier to understand\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58005","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update README.md\" (#58005)"},{"Id":"2554466664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-28T19:32:22","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"58004","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): avoid hydration warnings when `RenderMode.Client` is set","State":"open","Body":"With the newly-added `RenderMode` config for routes, some of the routes may have the `RenderMode.Client` mode enabled, while also having `provideClientHydration()` function in provider list at bootstrap.

For example:\r\n```ts\r\n// Infers string - fails\r\nformBuilder.group<{a: FormGroup<{a: FormControl<'a' | 'b'>}>}>({a: formBuilder.group({a: formBuilder.control('a')})});\r\n// Fails to infer array type\r\nformBuilder.group<{a: FormArray<FormControl<boolean>>}>({a: formBuilder.array([])});\r\n// Incorrect auto complete here (in ...) - k has unknown type\r\nformBuilder.group<{g: FormGroup<{k: FormGroup<{a: FormControl<number>}>}>}>({g: formBuilder.group({...})});\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new form builder variation which is oriented to cases when you provide the form type yourself. The new form builder will use `NoInfer` for parameter so the inference will be strictly from the return type which will solve the problems above.\r\nAn example implementation that will solve all the issues above:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class NoInferFormBuilder {\r\n  control<T>(\r\n    formState: NoInfer<T | FormControlState<T>>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormControl<T>(formState, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  group<\r\n    T extends {\r\n      [K in keyof T]: AbstractControl<any>;\r\n    }\r\n  >(\r\n    controls: NoInfer<T>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormGroup<T>(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  array<T extends AbstractControl<any>>(\r\n    controls: NoInfer<T[]>,\r\n    validatorOrOpts?:\r\n      | ValidatorFn\r\n      | ValidatorFn[]\r\n      | AbstractControlOptions\r\n      | null,\r\n    asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn | AsyncValidatorFn[] | null\r\n  ) {\r\n    return new FormArray<T>(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nGet around those problems which can be annoying and repetitive or use form classes which helps to some extent or use untyped forms.

This is because `ServerModule` imports `HttpClientModule`. https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/1549afe10eddc92845cd1fde862aaa010c2395af/packages/platform-server/src/server.ts#L83-L88\r\n\r\nThe repro uses `angular-in-memory-web-api` to demo the customization behavior.\r\n\r\nThe following things fix this:\r\n- Moving the `ServerModule` import above the `AppModule` in `AppServerModule` (https://github.com/griest024/ng18-ssr-module/tree/module-order)\r\n- Replacing the `ServerModule` import with `provideServerRendering()` (https://github.com/griest024/ng18-ssr-module/tree/server-provider)\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/griest024/ng18-ssr-module\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI:

Importantly, using a recent version of `istanbul-lib-instrument` and not the one that `karma-coverage` depends on.\r\n- [x] Preserve source maps so that coverage is mapped back to source files.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\n* The additions in `packages/angular/build/src/tools/babel/plugins/*` are 1:1 copies of files already present in `packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/babel/plugins/*`. I couldn't find a clean way to prevent that. Either @angular/build have to expose the plugin in `package.json#exports` or it would have to depend on @angular-devkit/build-angular. Both seemed undesirable.\r\n* The logic for excluding files from coverage is lifted from the [equivalent webpack config](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ecfb2b261356946d5f4a653f90c0b78db4ef519c/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/common.ts#L424-L429). Given the state of Karma, I didn't make an effort to refactor the code to share the logic - I assume we don't expect many changes here. That would definitely be possible with limited effort though.\r\n\r\n### Historical Notes\r\n\r\nApproaches that _didn't_ work:\r\n\r\n- Instrument entire output chunks. `karma-coverage` really doesn't want to filter data from coverage data after the fact. Not to mention that it could be fairly expensive to send that data back to the karma process if it's then just discarded.\r\n- Implied above: Use `karma-coverage`'s built-in preprocessor. The outdated instrumentation code it's using doesn't handle async function correctly and gives bad function coverage data because of it.\r\n\r\nThings that _could've_ worked:\r\n\r\n- Apply source maps while instrumenting instead of while post-processing the coverage data.

For some reason this only occurs when the application and the HMR are being served on the same port, resulting in the following error being thrown `client:529 WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:4200/' failed: Unrecognized frame opcode: 5`. \r\nOn receiving this error vite triggers a reload https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/eb08f605ddadef99a5d68f55de143e3e47c91618/packages/vite/src/client/client.ts#L106-L108\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to configure the hmr configuration in the angular.json making it possible to configure more advanced hmr settings (https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr).\r\n\r\nA use case of this is that it allows a custom hmr config which bypasses the browserstack error seen above.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28517","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat: allow configuration of the vite HMR server\" (#28517)"},{"Id":"2552017718","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T15:20:08","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28512","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency npm-package-arg to v12","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [npm-package-arg](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg) | dependencies | major | [`11.0.3` -> `12.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/npm-package-arg/11.0.3/12.0.0) |\n| [npm-package-arg](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg) | devDependencies | major | [`11.0.3` -> `12.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/npm-package-arg/11.0.3/12.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/npm-package-arg (npm-package-arg)</summary>\n\n### [`v12.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1200-2024-09-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/compare/v11.0.3...v12.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   `npm-package-arg` now supports node `^18.17.0 || >=20.5.0`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`6bf84db`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/6bf84db8c37990556fa8738d0985c5e904e44d02) [#&#8203;194](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/194) align to npm 10 node engine range ([@&#8203;reggi](https://redirect.github.com/reggi))\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   [`3361e59`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/3361e594418a6ed6088367682e362042e4318811) [#&#8203;194](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/194) `validate-npm-package-name@6.0.0`\n-   [`06e3bd6`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/06e3bd64cd4e727b9734e0e23be2b09afc3205cd) [#&#8203;194](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/194) `proc-log@5.0.0`\n-   [`96dd671`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/96dd671a06d8b27cd48258d068bdaaa83161cf3c) [#&#8203;194](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/194) `hosted-git-info@8.0.0`\n\n##### Chores\n\n-   [`163925e`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/163925e69326ef40d208f9789794dcdae6932cdd) [#&#8203;194](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/194) run template-oss-apply ([@&#8203;reggi](https://redirect.github.com/reggi))\n-   [`a8a9bdd`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/a8a9bddc726802fb5ed30f6b113d57f0655bbd51) [#&#8203;190](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/190) bump [@&#8203;npmcli/eslint-config](https://redirect.github.com/npmcli/eslint-config) from 4.0.5 to 5.0.0 ([@&#8203;dependabot](https://redirect.github.com/dependabot)\\[bot])\n-   [`f8d32ec`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/f8d32ec3d0cb2d195084195664d48719060b6447) [#&#8203;188](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/188) postinstall for dependabot template-oss PR ([@&#8203;hashtagchris](https://redirect.github.com/hashtagchris))\n-   [`a867f96`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/commit/a867f9644491a28560a8f751fa34320d7db14bde) [#&#8203;188](https://redirect.github.com/npm/npm-package-arg/pull/188) bump [@&#8203;npmcli/template-oss](https://redirect.github.com/npmcli/template-oss) from 4.23.1 to 4.23.3 ([@&#8203;dependabot](https://redirect.github.com/dependabot)\\[bot])\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, when using the `reset()` method with reactive forms, the form controls are unexpectedly marked as `touched` or `dirty`, causing **validation errors** to display immediately. This behavior is not intuitive and negatively impacts user experience, as the form appears to have errors even though no user interaction has occurred post-reset.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a stepper with multiple steps using Angular Material and reactive forms.\r\n2. Assign required validators to form controls in each step.\r\n3. Complete the stepper steps, then use the `reset()` method on the stepper to reset it.\r\n4. Observe that form controls are marked as `touched` or `dirty` even though the stepper was reset, and validation errors are displayed.\r\n5. Alternatively, you can also use the native `mat-stepper`: https://material.angular.io/components/stepper/examples#stepper-errors\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter calling `stepper.reset()`, all form controls should be reset to their initial state, marked as pristine and untouched. No validation errors should be displayed until the user interacts with the form controls again.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCalling `stepper.reset()` resets the stepper and form groups but marks all form controls as `touched` or `dirty`, triggering validation errors to display immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `18.1.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `18.1.1`\r\n- Browser(s): `Google Chrome`_(Version 127.0.6533.73 (Official Build) (arm64))_\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS(Sonoma 14.7)`, _Apple M1_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Stepper): Stepper `reset()` Method Marks Form Controls as `Touched/Dirty`, Triggering Validation Errors\" (#29781)"},{"Id":"2540752632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T06:28:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `youtube-player` to use the `inject` function instead of constructor-based injection.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function\" (#29775)"},{"Id":"2543298796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:58:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29778","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move classes out of core","State":"open","Body":"* Moves the mat-app-background class out of core\r\n* Moves the mat-elevation-* classes out of core","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: move classes out of core\" (#29778)"},{"Id":"2543202768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:06:03","Actor":"jacob-noble","Number":"29777","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/scrolling): virtual scroll flickers in zoneless mode.","State":"open","Body":"When `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is enabled, virtual-scroll-viewport flickers during scroll because the transform operation becomes visible.

Some work needed to make this happen (tracked in b/320536434). As a result with option `forbidOrphanComponents` being true the deps tracker will falsely report any component orphan if it or ots NgModule have custom decorators. So it is unsafe to use this option in the presence of custom decorator, and so we disable it until it is made compatible.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

default NoopZone implementation.\r\n\r\nRight now, if some code uses Zone.onStable() or Zone.onMicrotaskEmpty(), it will not work in a zoneless Angular app.\r\n\r\nBut if onStable() and onMicrotaskEmpty() implementations will emit in setTimeout(), everything works great.\r\nHere you can find the demo:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-sbyvuz?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nIn that demo, you can see that with the default noop zone implementation, when you move the pointer over buttons, tooltips are not displayed, and toasts are not displayed when you click a button.\r\n\r\nBut if you use custom implementation (uncomment line 31 and comment 30), everything works fine.\r\n\r\nNG Bootstrap is not the only library that uses Zone.onStable(), I believe there is a lot of code that does, and there is nothing wrong with it (it's not a bug of NG Bootstrap or other libraries and apps).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nHere is the code that demonstrates the idea:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { type EnvironmentProviders, EventEmitter, NgZone, ɵprovideZonelessChangeDetection } from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport { ReplaySubject } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\nclass ReplayEmitter<T> extends ReplaySubject<T> {\r\n  emit(v: T) {\r\n    this.next(v);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor(_isAsync?: boolean) {\r\n    super(1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class NoopNgZoneX implements NgZone {\r\n  readonly hasPendingMicrotasks = false;\r\n  readonly hasPendingMacrotasks = false;\r\n  readonly isStable = true;\r\n  readonly onUnstable = new EventEmitter<any>();\r\n\r\n  get onMicrotaskEmpty() {\r\n    const e = new ReplayEmitter<any>();\r\n    setTimeout(() => e.next(null));\r\n    return e as unknown as EventEmitter<any>;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get onStable() {\r\n    const e = new ReplayEmitter<any>();\r\n    setTimeout(() => e.next(null));\r\n    return e as unknown as EventEmitter<any>;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  readonly onError = new EventEmitter<any>();\r\n\r\n  run<T>(fn: (...args: any[]) => T, applyThis?: any, applyArgs?: any): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis, applyArgs);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  runGuarded<T>(\r\n    fn: (...args: any[]) => any,\r\n    applyThis?: any,\r\n    applyArgs?: any\r\n  ): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis,

applyArgs?: any,\r\n    _name?: string\r\n  ): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis, applyArgs);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI took the code of `NoopNgZone` from the source code of Angular, and modified 2 fields (`onMicrotaskEmpty`, `onStable`), everything else left as is.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI tried to emit synchronously (works only for a few cases), and tried to emit in

other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I create a new library the default component inside of the lib folder takes its type from the component schematic declared on angular.json. If for example my angular.json looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    //...\r\n    \"newProjectRoot\": \"projects\",\r\n    //...\r\n    \"schematics\": {\r\n        \"@schematics/angular:application\": {\r\n          \"style\": \"scss\",\r\n          \"inlineTemplate\": true,\r\n          \"inlineStyle\": true,\r\n          \"ssr\": false\r\n        },\r\n        \"@schematics/angular:component\": {\r\n          \"changeDetection\": \"OnPush\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Cmp\",\r\n          \"inlineStyle\": true,\r\n          \"inlineTemplate\": true,\r\n          \"style\": \"scss\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter creating a library using `ng generate library foo-library`, the new library includes an empty dummy `FooLibraryCmp` inside the `projects/foo-library/src/lib/foo-library.cmp.ts`. However, the contents of `projects/foo-library/src/public-api.ts` look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n * Public API Surface of foo-library\r\n */\r\n\r\nexport * from './lib/foo-library.service';\r\nexport * from './lib/foo-library.component'; // uses .component instead of .cmp\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.1\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.6\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.1\r\nng-packagr                      17.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26981","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"new library public-api.ts file not using component type declared on angular.json's schematics\" (#26981)"},{"Id":"2103555492","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-27T12:16:26","Actor":"muuvmuuv","Number":"26980","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vite dev-server HTTP2 support","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nWould it be possible or in scope to support HTTP2 for Vite dev-server?\r\n\r\nThere is this issue here that states Vite itself won't, but from one comment, a plugin can be created to use http2-proxy.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4184\r\nPossible solution: https://gist.github.com/xfournet/068592b3d1ddd488427b874b23f707bf\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26980","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite dev-server HTTP2 support\" (#26980)"},{"Id":"2103258747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-27T06:11:42","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26979","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | optionalDependencies | minor | [`0.19.12` -> `0.20.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.19.12/0.20.0) |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | minor | [`0.19.12` -> `0.20.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.19.12/0.20.0) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | dependencies | minor | [`0.19.12` -> `0.20.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.19.12/0.20.0) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | minor | [`0.19.12` -> `0.20.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.19.12/0.20.0) |\n| [inquirer](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/blob/master/packages/inquirer/README.md) ([source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)) | dependencies | patch | [`9.2.12` -> `9.2.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/inquirer/9.2.12/9.2.13) |\n| [inquirer](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/blob/master/packages/inquirer/README.md) ([source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)) | devDependencies | patch | [`9.2.12` -> `9.2.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/inquirer/9.2.12/9.2.13) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | dependencies | minor | [`6.4.0` -> `6.5.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.4.0/6.5.0) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | devDependencies | minor | [`6.4.0` -> `6.5.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.4.0/6.5.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.20.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0200)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.12...v0.20.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.19.0` or `~0.19.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\nThis time there is only one breaking change, and it only matters for people using Deno. Deno tests that use esbuild will now fail unless you make the change described below.\n\n-   Work around API deprecations in Deno 1.40.x ([#&#8203;3609](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3609), [#&#8203;3611](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3611))\n\n    [Deno 1.40.0](https://deno.com/blog/v1.40) was just released and introduced run-time warnings about certain APIs that esbuild uses. With this release, esbuild will work around these run-time warnings by using newer APIs if they are present and falling back to the original APIs otherwise. This should avoid the warnings without breaking compatibility with older versions of Deno.\n\n    Unfortunately, doing this introduces a breaking change. The newer child process APIs lack a way to synchronously terminate esbuild's child process, so calling `esbuild.stop()` from within a Deno test is no longer sufficient to prevent Deno from failing a test that uses esbuild's API (Deno fails tests that create a child process without killing it before the test ends). To work around this, esbuild's `stop()` function has been changed to return a promise, and you now have to change `esbuild.stop()` to `await esbuild.stop()` in all of your Deno tests.\n\n-   Reorder implicit file extensions within `node_modules` ([#&#8203;3341](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3341), [#&#8203;3608](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3608))\n\n    In [version 0.18.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.18.0), esbuild changed the behavior of implicit file extensions within `node_modules` directories (i.e. in published packages) to prefer `.js` over `.ts` even when the `--resolve-extensions=` order prefers `.ts` over `.js` (which it does by default). However, doing that also accidentally made esbuild prefer `.css` over `.ts`, which caused problems for people that published packages containing both TypeScript and CSS in files with the same name.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will reorder TypeScript file extensions immediately after the last JavaScript file extensions in the implicit file extension order instead of putting them at the end of the order. Specifically the default implicit file extension order is `.tsx,.ts,.jsx,.js,.css,.json` which used to become `.jsx,.js,.css,.json,.tsx,.ts` in `node_modules` directories. With this release it will now become `.jsx,.js,.tsx,.ts,.css,.json` instead.\n\n    Why even rewrite the implicit file extension order at all? One reason is because the `.js` file is more likely to behave correctly than the `.ts` file. The behavior of the `.ts` file  may depend on `tsconfig.json` and the `tsconfig.json` file may not even be published, or may use `extends` to refer to a base `tsconfig.json` file that wasn't published. People can get into this situation when they forget to add all `.ts` files to their `.npmignore` file before publishing to npm. Picking `.js` over `.ts` helps make it more likely that resulting bundle will behave correctly.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.13`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.5.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   build(deps-dev): bump jsdom from 23.2.0 to 24.0.0 by [@&#8203;dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632)\n-   feat: Implement EventSource by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608)\n-   fix: readable body by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Normalization is done here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/load-proxy-config.ts\r\n\r\nThis step perhaps mistakenly treats regular expressions as globs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // TODO: Consider upstreaming glob support\r\n  for (const key of Object.keys(normalizedProxy)) {\r\n    if (isDynamicPattern(key)) {\r\n      const { output } = parseGlob(key);\r\n      normalizedProxy[`^${output}$`] = normalizedProxy[key];\r\n      delete normalizedProxy[key];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser we had:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"/internal-api\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"!/hui/**\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild something like this should be equivalent if the configuration would go to Vite without changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  \"/internal-api\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/(?!hui).*\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/$\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nng-packagr                      17.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26970","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI messes up proxy.conf.js regex proxy -settings passed to Vite when using esbuild\" (#26970)"},{"Id":"2102362827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:21:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26974","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis commit fixes an issue were negated globs in proxy config were not process correctly when using vite.\r\n\r\nCloses #26970","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26974","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite\" (#26974)"},{"Id":"2102202540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T14:54:37","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26972","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): handle regular expressions in proxy config when using Vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit enables proxies to have a RegExp as context when using Vite.

In particular, select the secondary palette automatically based on the primary palette (secondary is intended to be a more muted version of primary). We still allow the user to select what tertiary color to pair with their primary, since the spec doesn't make the same sort of assumptions about the tertiary color.\r\n\r\nNote: because our demo targets styles at the .mat-primary, .mat-accent, .mat-error classes, it winds up overriding the default color combo that users would see out of the box for the mat-select (a primary form-field with a secondary selected option). This is one example where the M2 color=\"primary/accent/warn\" API doesn't quite align with how colors work in M3. We do not expect users to apply colors in this way, and we probably shouldn't do it in our demo either.

The problem is, the view does not properly update due to any events that happen. In my example I dragEnd, the data comes back from the server, and is not updated on the screen until I click or hover something. As soon as that happens the data shows properly. Happened in angular v15 and v17. changeDetectionRef.detectChanges() doesnt work to fix it either.\r\n\r\nI have other actions that call the exact same event (hitting the same endpoint) and when they return, the data shows properly. Perhaps it is an issue with the mat-table not playing nice with the drag end. I have seen many stack overflows alluding to this same issue. Im guessing this will just get closed because it 'doesnt exist' but there is definitely a bug in there experienced by many\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

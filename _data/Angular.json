Open the Angular DevTools on the Transfer State tab\n\n### Description\n\nI was not sure to put this as bug or feature request so checked both.\n\nIn the Transfer State tab we find a button on the top right corner to \"Refresh transfer state\". I don't understand why we have this option. Let me try to explain:\n\nWhen we set data in the transfer state during the server side rendering phase that data is serialized in the HTML and transferred to the client. Then when the client bootstraps and reloads the same components requiring that data, it is taken from the deserialized state in the HTML.\n\nSo far that is the basic use-case of the transfer state service.\n\nThat state is always deserialized from the DOM and the state is only serialized to the DOM on the serverside. This does not happen on the client side. So refreshing will always get the same data.\n\nUnless the refresh button would get it from the memory of TransferState during the client runtime. That way we could debug it on the client side as well. But not sure about the usefulness of that case. Typically you would only set something to the transfer state when running on the server:\n\n```\nif (isPlatformServer(this.platformId)) {\n  const data = await fetchIt();\n  this.transferState.set(POST_DETAIL_DATA_KEY, data);\n  return Promise.resolve(data);\n}\n```\n\nSo 2 options:\n\n1. Remove the refresh button ( makes most sense to me )\n2. Get the state from the client side TransferState instead of the DOM when refreshing and maybe do the initial load from the DOM ( multiple options here )","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove the refresh button of TransferState or fetch the transfer state from memory instead of DOM on the client side\" (#63454)"},{"Id":"3364587050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T20:29:53","Actor":"samvloeberghs","Number":"63453","RawContent":null,"Title":"The Router Tree is not showing all routes","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a bug report or a feature request?\n\n- [x] Bug Report\n- [ ] Feature Request\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue [Bug Report only]\n\n1.

So now code like this:\n\n```\n\t<custom-table [loadFilters]=\"getFilters\"></custom-table>\n```\n\nI guess has to look the below to be equivalent.\n\n```\n\t<custom-table [loadFilters]=\"getFilters.bind(this)\"></custom-table>\n```\n\nI can't overstate how frustrating this is both from a developer ergonomics and code safety perspective.

Which is defined in `@angular/build` package. It's good to understand that karma uses the di library for it's dependency injection. The `AngularPolyfillsPlugin` is defined in such a way. The type is set to `factory` and a function is provided, which is run by karma. All is fine so far, however karma expects the factory function to return a reporter. This is currently not happening. It just returns undefined.\n\nWhen using the `karma test explorer` plugin for `Visual Code` karma will load all defined reporters in the MultiReporter defined in `multi.js` in the karma project class. This will access the adapters property of every reporter and push to it.\n\nThe problem is, the factory function of the  `angular-polyfills` reporter returns undefined. Therefor kamra crashes on startup if run with multiple reporters, which it does in case of the `Karma Test Explorer` extension. If the factory function would return `{ adapters:[] }` all works fine and `Karma Test Explorer` is all happy again, because now karma does not crash when executed. \n\nHowever I am not an expert at all in karma reporters and the di library. So it is very well possible, some other solution, change is more appropriate to fix this issue. And I am fully aware karma is deprecated, but because there is no stable, non experimental replacement available just yet, I would really really appreciate it, if this plugin get fixed so karma will work again in scenarios other as `ng test`.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.6\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.5.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.6\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.6\n@angular/build               20.2.0\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.0\n@angular/cli                 20.1.6\n@schematics/angular          20.1.6\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31039","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Karma reporter:angular-polyfills factory does not return a reporter which breaks karma in some situations\" (#31039)"},{"Id":"3357139930","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-27T11:40:03","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31047","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): remove tags usage from @angular-devkit/core","State":"closed","Body":"Usages of the `tags` template literal utility have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe logic has been refactored to use standard JavaScript template literals and string manipulation methods to achieve the same formatting results.

This causes the two distinct `02:00` times (DST vs standard) on the fallback day to collapse into one — selecting the non-DST `02:00` ends up mapped to the DST `02:00`.\n\n### Custom DateAdapter:\nTo ensure consistent Luxon `DateTime` handling, I replaced the default `LuxonDateAdapter` with a custom one.\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomDateAdapter extends LuxonDateAdapter {\n  protected override locale = DateTimeService.LOCALE;\n\n  constructor() {\n    super(DATE_FORMATS);\n  }\n\n  /** Ensure datepicker provides Luxon DateTimes in the default zone */\n  public override createDate(year: number, month: number, date: number): DateTime {\n    return super.createDate(year, month, date)\n      .setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE)\n      .setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Needed so the timepicker does not treat DST and non-DST versions of the same wall time as equal.\n   * Without this, both values are considered the same and the DST one always “wins”.\n   */\n  public override sameTime(first: DateTime | null, second: DateTime | null): boolean {\n    if (!isDefined(first) || !isDefined(second)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    return +first === +second;\n  }\n\n  public override clone(date: DateTime): DateTime {\n    let cloned = super.clone(date);\n    cloned = cloned.setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE);\n    cloned = cloned.setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n    return cloned;\n  }\n}\n´´´\n\nDespite these adjustments, the underlying `_assignUserSelection` logic in the timepicker still collapses the two 02:00 times into one, because of how it uses the last valid date + setTime.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fyaws5vk\nSteps to reproduce:\n* Use the custom CustomDateAdapter (above) instead of the default LuxonDateAdapter.\nOn the DST end day ( 2025-10-26), try selecting both 02:00 (DST) and 02:00 (STD).\n* Observe that selecting the 02:00 (STD) still results in the 02:00 (DST) value being applied (or both depending on Custom vs LuxonDateAdapter).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* The timepicker should treat 02:00 DST and 02:00 STD as distinct values when using a fixed timezone.\n* Selecting the standard-time 02:00 should not be coerced into the DST-time 02:00.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* Because `_assignUserSelection` rebuilds the target date and applies extracted hours, the ambiguous hour is resolved to the earlier offset (DST).\n* Even with a custom adapter that distinguishes times (`sameTime` override), the timepicker ends up normalizing both selections to the DST instance.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome, ...\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n\n- Custom DateAdapter: subclass of LuxonDateAdapter (see above)\n- Timezone: Europe/Vienna\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(timepicker): Timepicker DST edge case: incorrect hour mapping with fixed timezone + custom Luxon adapter\" (#31803)"},{"Id":"3364051758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T17:01:37","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31802","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group","State":"open","Body":"WIP: fixing tests","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31802","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group\" (#31802)"},{"Id":"3363793893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T15:32:55","Actor":"RomainActemium","Number":"31801","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(google-maps): mapDblclick not firing on AdvancedMarkerElement","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm using @angular/google-maps and AdvancedMarkerElement to display custom markers on my Google Map.

behavior of title and meta services in server side. also Angular doesn't insert the added meta tags and the new title in the source code if rendered in client-side which makes issue with SEO and when

my application I am using a decorator `@DynamicComponent` to marks components that can later be rendered using `viewContainerRef.createComponent(...)` (see the guide for [dynamic component loading](https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader)).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n@DynamicComponent('hello')\r\n@Component({ template: `<h1>Hello Angular</h1>` })\r\nexport class HelloComponent {}\r\n```\r\nThe decorator registers the component with a string on a static map.\r\n```javascript\r\nexport function DynamicComponent(name: string) {\r\n  return (ctor) => {\r\n    componentRegistry.set(name, ctor);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\nexport const componentRegistry = new Map<string, any>();\r\n```\r\nLater the same string can be used to find the component and to load/create it dynamically.\r\n```javascript\r\n@Component({ template: `<ng-template anchor></ng-template>` })\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  @ViewChild(AnchorDirective, { static: true }) anchorHost!: AnchorDirective;\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    const viewContainerRef = this.anchorHost.viewContainerRef;\r\n    viewContainerRef.clear();\r\n    const component = componentRegistry.get('hello');\r\n    viewContainerRef.createComponent(component);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis works fine in development mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, in production (`ng serve --configuration production`) the decorators are never executed because Ivy believes the components are not used/needed.\r\nThis is because the dynamic components are only used in the modules where they are declared.\r\nThe moment I write some dummy code using the dynamic component (e.g. `new HelloComponent()`) everything works fine again.\r\n\r\nI provided a stackblitz below where this is implemented.\r\nIn stackblitz everything is working fine because it is started in development mode.\r\nTo run it in production mode download the stackblitz example and run `npm install --force && npm start`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://angular-ivy-ypsare.stackblitz.io\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR TypeError:

believe something like this is necessary again in order to mark components that should not be ignored by Ivy just because it cannot find a direct reference to it in the source code.\r\nWithout any changes I believe the loading & creating dynamic component is not working as expected as it requires the components to be at least once loaded/created **non**-dynamically.\r\n\r\nI would be thankful

[`v0.14.27`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01427)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.26...v0.14.27)\n\n-   Avoid generating an enumerable `default` import for CommonJS files in Babel mode ([#&#8203;2097](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2097))\n\n    Importing a CommonJS module into an ES module can be done in two different ways. In node mode the `default` import is always set to `module.exports`, while in Babel mode the `default` import passes through to `module.exports.default` instead. Node mode is triggered when the importing file ends in `.mjs`, has `type: \"module\"` in its `package.json` file, or the imported module does not have a `__esModule` marker.\n\n    Previously esbuild always created the forwarding `default` import in Babel mode, even if `module.exports` had no property called `default`. This was problematic because the getter named `default` still showed up as a property on the imported namespace object, and could potentially interfere with code that iterated over the properties of the imported namespace object. With this release the getter named `default` will now only be added in Babel mode if the `default` property exists at the time of the import.\n\n-   Fix a circular import edge case regarding ESM-to-CommonJS conversion ([#&#8203;1894](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1894), [#&#8203;2059](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2059))\n\n    This fixes a regression that was introduced in version 0.14.5 of esbuild. Ever since that version, esbuild now creates two separate export objects when you convert an ES module file into a CommonJS module: one for ES modules and one for CommonJS modules. The one for CommonJS modules is written to `module.exports` and exported from the file, and the one for ES modules is internal and can be accessed by bundling code that imports the entry point (for example, the entry point might import itself to be able to inspect its own exports).\n\n    The reason for these two separate export objects is that CommonJS modules are supposed to see a special export called `__esModule` which indicates that the module used to be an ES module, while ES modules are not supposed to see any automatically-added export named `__esModule`. This matters for real-world code both because people sometimes iterate over the properties of ES module export namespace objects and because some people write ES module code containing their own exports named `__esModule` that they expect other ES module code to be able to read.\n\n    However, this change to split exports into two separate objects broke ES module re-exports in the edge case where the imported module is involved in an import cycle. This happened because the CommonJS `module.exports` object was no longer mutated as exports were added. Instead it was being initialized at the end of the generated file after the import statements to other modules (which are converted into `require()` calls). This release changes `module.exports` initialization to happen earlier in the file and then double-writes further exports to both the ES module and CommonJS module export objects.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;indutny](https://togithub.com/indutny).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.4`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1304-httpswwwgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1303v1304-2022-03-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.0.3...v13.0.4)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser</summary>\n\n### [`v5.12.1`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5121)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.12.0...v5.12.1)\n\n-   Fixed an issue with function definitions inside blocks ([#&#8203;1155](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/issues/1155))\n-   Fixed parens of `new` in some situations (closes [#&#8203;1159](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/issues/1159))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

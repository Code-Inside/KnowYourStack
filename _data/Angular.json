Both APIs support states like `loading`, `resolved`, and `error`, which are critical for managing async workflows in the UI.  \n\nHowever, these two features currently work independently. It seems like a natural fit for `defer` and `Resource` to work together, leveraging their respective strengths to simplify and enhance the developer experience for handling asynchronous data.  \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an integration between the `defer` and the `Resource` API to enable seamless usage in templates. Possible features could include:  \n\n1. Allowing `defer` to accept a `Resource` as its input, automatically binding to its state transitions (`loading`, `resolved`, `error`).  \n2. Providing built-in optimizations for rendering `Resource` states declaratively with `defer`. For example, a `Resource`-aware `defer` could simplify boilerplate code for displaying loading spinners, error messages, or resolved data.  \n3. Ensuring consistent state management and declarative workflows across the framework when combining these APIs.  \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- **Manual Handling:** Developers can currently use `defer` and `Resource` separately, manually binding their states to templates. While functional, this requires additional boilerplate and lacks the declarative synergy that integration could provide.  \n- **Custom Wrappers:** Developers can write custom helper to bridge `defer` and `Resource`, but this approach increases complexity and reduces framework-wide consistency.  \n- **Leave as Is:** The features can remain independent, but integration would better align with Angular’s goal of reducing friction in building modern web applications.  \n\nThis proposed integration would streamline how developers handle asynchronous data, making Angular more intuitive and powerful for real-world use cases.

Because of this, it's not possible to reuse variables in a more generic way, as I showed in the example.

Unfortunately, I get an error because the name repeats what is defined above.\n\n`    <!-- First variable -->\n    @let addressFormControls = employeeOffboardForm.controls.address.controls; \n    <div class=\"offboard__form-row\">\n      <mat-form-field subscriptSizing=\"dynamic\">\n        // it's ok to use nested variable\n        @let control = addressFormControls.streetLine; \n        <mat-label>Street line</mat-label>\n        <input [formControl]=\"addressFormControls.streetLine\" matInput />\n        @if (control.hasError(\"required\")) {\n          <mat-error>To pole jest wymagane</mat-error>\n        }\n        @if (control.hasError(\"maxlength\")) {\n          <mat-error>Maksymalna długość to 50 znaków</mat-error>\n        }\n      </mat-form-field>\n\n      <mat-form-field subscriptSizing=\"dynamic\">\n        <!-- here is an error becouse of repeated variable name -->\n        @let control = addressFormControls.streetLine;\n        <mat-label>Postal code</mat-label>\n        <input [formControl]=\"addressFormControls.postalCode\" matInput />\n        @if (control.hasError(\"required\")) {\n          <mat-error>To pole jest wymagane</mat-error>\n        }\n        @if (control.hasError(\"pattern\")) {\n          <mat-error>Nieprawidłowy kod pocztowy</mat-error>\n        }\n      </mat-form-field>\n    </div>`\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt would be very useful if the scope was applied to HTML tags. Currently, I am forced to give specific names for each one, which is not always convenient. However, if the reason for this is performance, I would understand, but I would appreciate it if you could explain why this particular model was adopted.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAn alternative is to leave it as it is now.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59195","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add more granular scope to @let syntax\" (#59195)"},{"Id":"2739965346","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-14T16:03:22","Actor":"kkninjae","Number":"59194","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use model API in two-way binding example","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I think this would be valuable primarily because there are significant differences between the webpack proxy server and the vite proxy server and adding this would be a useful escape hatch for any issues that come up.\n\nIf you look into it you'll see that the vite proxy server is simplistic and doesn't have much functional test coverage, whereas the vite plugin/middleware APIs are pretty full featured and well tested. Therefore limiting developers to the functionality of the vite proxy server is harming users and creating unnecessary support issues for angular (b/c the proxy is our only way to change request behavior during development).\n\nHere are some of the changes between the [webpack proxy](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) and the vite proxy:\n* `bypass` fn doesn't support async/Promise methods\n(I [opened an issue for this](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/18920) and it's being worked on)\n* `bypass` fn doesn't officially support bypassing the request\nSee the [conversation here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/18940/files/e148ce1aa3de4c2cb3656a6cf96c1f7c3d3500cd#r1886095717) - in short, the maintainer said:\n\n> > we can't use vite plugins/middleware, b/c Angular exposes the vite proxy API, but doesn't allow vite plugins to be added.\n>\n> I think Angular should expose an additional feature on their side; it doesn't feel right to me to create duplicate surfaces on the Vite side for a workaround just because Angular limited the surfaces.\n\n* [No support for `router`](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware?tab=readme-ov-file#router-objectfunction)\n* No support for much of the [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) functionality\n\nIt seems to me there are a number of angular issues due to the vite proxy server not being compatible with the webpack proxy server API, where people have built up significant dev server capabilities that is all associated with the old proxy server, and they can't migrate due to features they rely on not being supported. This feature would at least give people a way to help themselves.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n```json\n        \"serve\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"proxyConfig\": \"dist/app/dev/proxy.conf.js\",\n            \"vitePlugins\": [\"dist/app/dev/mock-authentication-plugin.js\"],\n            \"buildTarget\": \"app:build\"\n          }\n        }\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWrite a new out-of-process dev proxy server that has to be spun up before the dev server is started, and proxy everything to it that requires replacing development request behavior. This would be cumbersome during development, and also some work to write - we would have to proxy websockets for example.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29149","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add vite plugin support for dev server\"

But I only started to develop its features and routes today. Then I found this minor bug: when my path is redirected to a child route or when I refresh the child route's webpage, I keep getting vite log erros in my VSCode terminal (check 'Exception or Error' section further down).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23fbccce-09e2-49ca-969e-9c7409a3ba14)\n\nThis won't happen with routes that are notnested (that are not child or grandchild routes). I also tested without lazy-loading the children routes, and the problem persists. Another thing: the error also appears even if the route is not nested through the children or loadChildren properties, but simply by its path string, for example:\n\n```ts\nexport const appRoutes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'user/profile',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n    component: ProfileComponent\n  },\n];\n\n```\n\nNonetheless, the application seems to work normally, but I couldn't test a lot since there is not a lot of features yet in my application. If I run `ng build` and run the SSR default script `node dist/{project-name}/server/server.mjs`, there are no error logs at all.\n\nOne thing that is interesting to mention is that if you look into my code, my application is set to redirect the root path to the authentication module, which has its own `<router-outlet />`, and then the module redirects the user to the 'authentication/login'. So, when I run `ng serve` and access `http://localhost:4200`, I go directly to the mentioned login route and page, and I see the Vite error log. But, if I remove the root route redirect to 'authentication' and create a navbar inside `app.component.html` with a routerLink property that targets the child route 'authentication/login', the first time the page is rendered, I see no error log, but if I refresh the page, Vite logs it in the console.\n\n### My Code:\n`src/app/app.routes.ts`\n```ts\nimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nexport const appRoutes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n    redirectTo: 'authentication',\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'authentication',\n    loadChildren: ()

Add `\"baseHref\": \"/my-app/\"` in `angular.json` at `architect/build/options`.\n4. Run `ng serve` and visit `http://localhost:4200/my-app/`\n\nYou could see the served webpage shows `<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/my-app/my-app/favicon.ico\">` (double `my-app` here), and the favicon doesn't show.\n\nIf you use `ng build` and `node .\\dist\\{project-name}\\server\\server.mjs`, and visit `http://localhost:4000/my-app`, the served page will show the correct unchanged URL `href=\"/my-app/favicon.ico`. (We need also add the base href to the \"express\" server to make it able to fetch the ico file, but this is irrelevant to the issue here.)\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 20.12.2\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.5\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.13\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.12\n@angular/cli                    18.2.12\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.12\n@schematics/angular             18.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThe behavior change here may also be relevent with changing from `browser` builder to `application` builder.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29139","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng serve prepends baseHref to absolute URLs in HTML\" (#29139)"},{"Id":"2740088962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-14T18:45:38","Actor":"kyesil","Number":"29137","RawContent":null,"Title":"Application builder grows output folder every change in watch mode","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nbrowser builder\n\n### Description\n\nWith new application builder,\nWhen compiling with  “ng build --watch”, if “namedChunks” is turned on, new chunk files are add in the output folder with every file change after the output folder gets bigger and bigger.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n``` \n        \"build\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"outputPath\":  \"dist\",\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\n            \"browser\": \"src/main.ts\",\n            \"polyfills\": [\n              \"zone.js\"\n            ],\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.app.json\",\n            \"inlineStyleLanguage\": \"scss\",\n            \"assets\": [\n              \"src/assets\n            ],\n\t\t\t...\n          },\n\t\t\t....\n              \"outputHashing\": \"all\"\n            },\n            \"development\": {\n              \"optimization\": true,\n              \"extractLicenses\": false,\n              \"sourceMap\": true,\n              \"namedChunks\": true\n            }\n          },\n```\n\n1.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`.

tried to build my app with following setting, I have ~20k urls to build. and because all requests are sent concurrently from the build process, the api is taking time to process all these concurrent requests.\n{\n    ...\n     \"prerender\":{   \n        \"routesFile\": \"prerender-urls.txt\",\n        \"discoverRoutes\": false\n     },\n      \"ssr\": false\n    ...\n}\n\nbecause of this delay, the page is taking more time to response than Agular build process waits and it fails with timeout error.\n\nI did my research and opened a[ stackoverflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79239766/angular-ssg-prerendering-gives-timeout-when-rendering-big-numb-of-urls-v17) after I couldn't find any proper solution to this. I see other people facing the same problem. so opening this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\ncreate a new app with 1 component, enable prerender with few diff parameter urls that needs backend api calls,  api should simulate a delay in response about  5 min or more to make it happen fast, build angular app and wait until the build throws a timeout  error.\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nPrerendered 3 static routes.\nApplication bundle generation failed.

When navigating the calendar using a screen reader, each button will be read as \"toggle button\" indicating that the buttons state should change each time the button is pressed. However the button does not behave like a toggle button. Once the button is toggled it cannot be \"untoggled\", potentially causing confusion for the user. I believe the `aria-pressed` attribute on the button should be removed to correctly reflect the buttons behaviour. \n\nThis was discovered during a recent accessibility evaluation and they provided the following link: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html\n\n### Reproduction\n\nExample link: https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview#datepicker-inline-calendar\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

custom color @angular/material:theme-color","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nMy problem is that I still can't understand how `@angular/material:theme-color` works. In the terminal, I need to provide colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary. For each one, I specify a single color, like #ff9500, because that's what I want.\n\n`What HEX color should be used to generate the M3 theme? It will represent your primary color palette. (ex. #ffffff) **#005dba**\nWhat HEX color should be used represent the secondary color palette? (Leave blank to use generated colors from Material) **#005dba**\nWhat HEX color should be used represent the tertiary color palette? (Leave blank to use generated colors from Material) **#005dba**`\n\n However, when generating the theme, I see that it creates color palettes, but when I try to get just my color, I use **`--mat-sys-primary`.** Unfortunately, it appears significantly darker (#8c5000), and I don't know which variable the color is actually hidden under. I have the impression that due to the low contrast, it is being artificially darkened. However, I selected the option not to generate mixins with high contrast. I would like to be able to use exactly that color without worrying about contrast. Currently, I am forced to manually change all the system token colors because the generated palette still interferes too much with what I want to achieve, taking away the flexibility I need in this case.\n\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nIt would be great to be able to specify in the terminal that I want exactly the colors I mention, without any interference.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30167","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theme-generator): Add possibility to force custom color @angular/material:theme-color\" (#30167)"},{"Id":"2733260497","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-11T16:16:19","Actor":"theSumit67","Number":"30166","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(AngularAnimations): Detached dom nodes with material component on navigation","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have a very basic app in Angular + Material version 14. \n\nOn one page I have mat-tabs and a button which navigates to a blank component destroying the previous component.

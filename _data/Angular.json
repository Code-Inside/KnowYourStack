This isn't right because `[formControl]` directives are intended to be used without a `ControlContainer`. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be caused by `NgControlStatusGroup` having too broad of a selector, so that it activates on all `form` tags. \r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n- You can circumvent the problem by adding `ngNoForm` to the parent `<form>` tag, but that is not intuitive\r\n- You can also work around the problem by adding the `FormsModule` so `NgForm` is automatically created. However, this isn't really correct because it requires mixing the forms modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-cke9q5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\nIf you load that Stackblitz, you can see the error in the console.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\npreview-e378c6d150742202f755b.js:1 ERROR Error: NodeInjector: NOT_FOUND [ControlContainer]\r\n    at getOrCreateInjectable (core.umd.js:4047)\r\n    at Object.ɵɵdirectiveInject (core.umd.js:14362)\r\n    at NodeInjectorFactory.NgControlStatusGroup_Factory [as factory] (forms.umd.js:1058)\r\n    at getNodeInjectable (core.umd.js:4141)\r\n    at instantiateAllDirectives (core.umd.js:8464)\r\n    at createDirectivesInstances (core.umd.js:7831)\r\n    at Object.ɵɵelementStart (core.umd.js:14511)\r\n    at AppComponent_Template (app.component.ts:18)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.umd.js:7804)\r\n    at renderView (core.umd.js:7613)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nIvy, v10\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't use a <form> tag with a [formControl] directive\" (#38391)"},{"Id":"675716514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-09T17:56:57","Actor":"anjneeksharma","Number":"38390","RawContent":null,"Title":"can not import module after upgrading Angular 10 from Angular 9","State":"closed","Body":"Upgraded to Angular 10 from 9 now i am getting some import error even after installing those module.\r\nBellow are the module which i am not able to import.\r\n\r\nimport { ApolloModule} from 'apollo-angular';\r\nimport { HttpLinkModule} from 'apollo-angular/http';\r\n\r\nbut i can import  import {HttpLink} from 'apollo-angular/http';  \r\n\r\nPlease help me.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38390","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"can not import module after upgrading Angular 10 from Angular 9\" (#38390)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"677392625","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-12T05:20:14","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18510","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update karma-jasmine to version ~4.0.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [karma-jasmine](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine) | devDependencies | major | [`~3.3.0` -> `~4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine/3.3.1/4.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>karma-runner/karma-jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;400-httpsgithubcomkarma-runnerkarma-jasminecomparev331v400-2020-08-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/compare/v3.3.1...v4.0.0)\n\n##### chore\n\n-   update dependencies ([#&#8203;275](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/issues/275)) ([0adead4](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/commit/0adead425d44457b2b510cee9d79e7d6c4a203f1))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   Drop support for node 8 (add support for node 14)\n\n#### [3.3.1](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/compare/v3.3.0...v3.3.1) (2020-05-28)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **filter:** match any portion of a spec name ([#&#8203;270](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/issues/270)) ([ded4c4b](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/commit/ded4c4b13ecc0ed976ee00b0ae808dbcd134157b)), closes [#&#8203;256](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine/issues/256)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Reproduced at least since in 10.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter turning off bundleDependencies, one single app module cannot be resolved: `\"../../../utils\"`.\r\nExact name and path matter. I feel kind of weird just as I write this...\r\n\r\n**Following minor changes to the setup magically fix the problem:**\r\n- moving the module one level up in dir structure\r\n- renaming it into e.g \"util2\" \r\n- renaming `utils/index.ts` into e.g. `utils/some-file.ts` else and importing from this file directly\r\n- importing it from another location (so that relative import path becomes different)\r\n\r\n**Following changes do not fix the problem though:**\r\n- changing from `../../../utils.ts` to `../../../utils/index.ts` (which resolves the same, based on node module resolution rules)\r\n- change import path from `../../../utils` to `../../../utils/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n- Create a fresh angular 10 project, add universal as per the docs\r\n- **Add `\"bundleDependencies\": false` to the server builder options**\r\n- Create \"app/utils.ts\" put an empty class inside and export it\r\n```\r\n// app/utils.ts\r\nexport class Utils {}\r\n```\r\n- Create a component nested 3 levels down from `app`, declare it in AppModule\r\n- in this component, import the class and try to instantiate it right away (or try to inject into the component, if it was declared as injectable):\r\n```\r\n// app/feature1/components/test/test.component.ts\r\nimport {Component} from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport {Utils} from \"../../../utils\";\r\n\r\nconst utils = new Utils();\r\n\r\n@Component({template: \"\"})\r\nexport class TestComponent {}\r\n```\r\nWe end up with the following dir structure:\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n  - feature1/\r\n    - components/\r\n      - test/\r\n        - test.component.ts\r\n  utils.ts\r\n```\r\n- Ok, we're done. Now run `npm run dev:ssr`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nError: Cannot find module '../../../utils'\r\nRequire stack:\r\n- /Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js\r\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:623:15)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:527:27)\r\n    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:681:19)\r\n    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:16:16)\r\n    at Object.../../../utils (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:96:18)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Module../src/app/feature1/components/test/test.component.ts (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:653:64)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Module../src/app/app.module.ts (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:561:98)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/amakhrov/Projects/angular-utils-test/dist/angular-utils-test/server/main.js:20:30) \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.5\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders             10.0.1\r\n@nguniversal/common               10.0.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine       10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.7\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18493","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cannot find module '../../../utils' when bundleDependencies=false\" (#18493)"},{"Id":"675593255","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-10T08:46:48","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"18488","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix relative paths with bundleDependencies=false","State":"closed","Body":"When `bundleDependencies` is turned off, webpack is configured to bundle all modules imported via relative path.\r\nIt works well for import paths like `'./some/file'` but fails for imports traversing the dir structure up, like `'../some/file'`.\r\n\r\nIn most cases it would still work well, because of the additional fallback (which checks whether node can resolve this module at all).

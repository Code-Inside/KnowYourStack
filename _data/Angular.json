As of version 21.0.0-next.0, you need to provide an arrow function and, within that, call the different validator functions you need. You need to repeat the fields that you want to target (e.g. `path.roomNumber`), and you can call them in whatever order you like.\n\nThis has a few implications. A team would need to, or at least should, decide on an order or grouping. They could decide to group them by type of validator (see example below) or group them by field. In both cases, this would require either additional linting rules or a proper review. \n\nFor small forms and validation logic, this may not be an issue at all, but I don't think it scales well. For larger forms, it will become much harder to reason about what is being validated. If you group the validators by type, you make it even harder to find out which field has which requirements. Even adding new validators can lead to duplication or misplacement. \n\nHere is a signal form with the current validation style. It includes what I believe to be the pros and cons, and it serves as a reference for my suggestions. \n\nAll code examples can also be found in this repository: https://github.com/TheNordicOne/signal-form-playground\n\n```ts\n/*\n    21.0.0-next.0\n\n    ***Pros:**\n    - simple\n    - flexible\n      e.g.: team can decide if to group validators by field (path.roomNumber) or by kind (required/minLength; like in this example)\n\n    ***Cons:**\n    - repetitive field selection (path.something)\n    - not fully declarative, as validators can be in any order\n      - e.g.: to ensure you find all validators for roomNumber you must look through ALL validators\n    - ordering/grouping of validators is not enforced and therefore likely to get mixed up or overlooked\n      - e.g.: a dev might not see there already is a validator for minLength and just add a second one  in a different place)\n  */\n  requestForm = form(this.request, (path) => {\n    required(path.buildingNumber, { message: 'Please enter the room number' });\n    required(path.roomNumber, { message: 'Please enter the room number' });\n    required(path.fullName);\n    required(path.details.category);\n    required(path.details.description);\n    required(path.email);\n\n    minLength(path.buildingNumber, 2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' });\n    minLength(path.roomNumber, 2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' });\n\n    validateBuildingExists(path.buildingNumber);\n    validateRoomExists(path);\n\n    applyWhenValue(\n      path,\n      (request) => request.details.urgency === 'high' || request.details.urgency === 'critical',\n      (request) => {\n        required(request.phone, {\n          message: 'For urgent requests, please enter your phone number so we can call you back!',\n        });\n      },\n    );\n  });\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe goal of my alternatives is to provide a declarative way of adding validators. They will require further discussion and should be mostly seen as starting points for that. Likely there are cases I have not considered yet or maybe I'm one of the few people who would prefer a different style.\n\n\n### Alternative A\n\nThis alternative uses a validation object, where each key corresponds to a field in the form. The value is an array of validators to apply. Most notably, we no longer pass the field explicitly, but rather let Angular handle it. The available keys can be enforced and/or provided by TypeScript.\n\nThis approach already makes it easier to reason about the validation of any given field. For example one can see at a glance, that the `buildingNumber` is required, must have at least 2 characters and must exist.\n\nThis version is not ideal though. Cross-field validation still need to be applied through the whole form. So, just by looking at `roomNumber` you wouldn't know that the room is also checked for existence.\n\nThen there is the matter of form groups. Defining a validator for a nested field needs to happen through a string key (`'details.category'`), which reduces the readability. \n\nOne more downside, which all other alternatives share, is the need for a reserved key for validation of the whole form. A reserved key always has the potential to collide with form field names required by the business logic. \n\n```ts\n/*\n    Alternative A\n\n    ***Pros:**\n    - almost fully declarative\n      - all validators for a given field are immediately visible\n    - fields are not repeated\n    - which field is targeted when using applyWhenValue is clear\n\n\n    ***Cons:**\n    - readability can be hindered\n      - may depend a little on the formatting\n      - also depends on how nested fields can be accessed\n    - requires a reserved key to add validators to the whole form\n      - reserved keys have potential to collide with one required for business logic\n    - applyWhenValue now only targets a single field, which may lead to repetitive boolean checks\n    - cross-field validation requires setting it on the root level, which breaks declarativity\n  */\n  requestForm = form(this.request, {\n    buildingNumber: [\n      required({ message: 'Please enter the room number' }),\n      minLength(2),\n      validateBuildingExists(),\n    ],\n    roomNumber: [required({ message: 'Please enter the room number' }), minLength(2)],\n    fullName: [required()],\n    email: [required()],\n    'details.category': [required()],\n    'details.description': [required()],\n    phone: [\n      applyWhenValue(\n        (request) => request.details.urgency === 'high' || request.details.urgency === 'critical',\n        [\n          required({\n            message: 'For urgent requests, please enter your phone number so we can call you back!',\n          }),\n        ],\n      ),\n    ],\n    root: [validateRoomExists()],\n  });\n```\n\n### Alternative B\n\nThe overall idea is the same: you have a validator object with keys corresponding to the fields you want to validate. The major difference is that instead of an array of validators to apply, you pass an arrow function that receives the field to validate as a parameter. This means you also don't repeat the fields. In the example, I then continue to use the built-in validator functions. \n\nThis alternative suffers from pretty much the same issues as Alternative A, but I also find it more verbose than using an array.\n\nConditionally applying validators with `applyWhenValue` is done via the form root. In principle, it could be done the same way as in Alternative A, but I also wanted to provide an example of how one could avoid repetitive predicates while keeping the overall syntax the same.\n\n```ts\n/*\n    Alternative B\n\n    ***Pros:**\n    - mostly declarative\n    - fields are not repeated\n    - applyWhenValue only requires the condition to be written once\n    - (maybe) more flexible for having an arrow function\n\n    ***Cons:**\n    - applyWhenValue makes it overall less declarative, but is itself declarative\n    - more verbose due to needing an arrow function\n      - maybe not too bad because it is a pattern we as devs are used to\n    - access to nested properties not great\n    - requires a reserved key to add validators to the whole form\n  */\n  requestForm = form(this.request, {\n    buildingNumber: (field) => {\n      required(field, { message: 'Please enter the room number' });\n      minLength(field, 2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' });\n      validateBuildingExists(field);\n    },\n    roomNumber: (field) => {\n      required(field, { message: 'Please enter the room number' });\n      minLength(field, 2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' });\n    },\n    fullName: (field) => {\n      required(field);\n    },\n    'details.category': (field) => {\n      required(field);\n    },\n    'details.description': (field) => {\n      required(field);\n    },\n    email: (field) => {\n      required(field);\n    },\n    root: (path) => {\n      validateRoomExists(path);\n      applyWhenValue(\n        path,\n        (request) => request.details.urgency === 'high' || request.details.urgency === 'critical',\n        {\n          phone: (field) => {\n            required(field, {\n              message:\n                'For urgent requests, please enter your phone number so we can call you back!',\n            });\n          },\n        },\n      );\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n### Alternative C\n\nAgain, we are using a validator object to declare our validation logic and arrays. There are two major differences compared to the previous alternatives.\n\nFirst of all, this approach assumes that a validator function always has access to the whole form context for cross-field validation. This avoids the need to do cross-field validation via the root form.\n\nThe second difference is how we deal with form groups. Here, you create a nested object that follows the same structure as your actual form. The idea is to keep the validation declaration as close to the form model as possible.\n\nBut there is still the issue of repetitive predicates. This may or may not be an issue, but it would still be nice to address it.\n\n```ts\n/*\n    Alternative C\n\n    This alternative makes the assumption, that a validator function always has access to\n    the whole form context, to be able to do cross-field validation\n\n    ***Pros:**\n    - fully declarative\n      - all validators for a given field are immediately visible\n    - fields are not repeated\n    - defining validators for form groups uses the exact shape as the value\n    - which field is targeted when using applyWhenValue is clear\n    - doing cross-field validation does not require special functions\n\n    ***Cons:**\n    - requires a reserved key to add validators to the whole form\n      - reserved keys have potential to collide with one required for business logic\n    - applyWhenValue now only targets a single field, which may lead to repetitive boolean checks\n  */\n  requestForm = form(this.request, {\n    buildingNumber: [\n      required({ message: 'Please enter the building number' }),\n      minLength(2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' }),\n      validateBuildingExists(),\n    ],\n    roomNumber: [\n      required({ message: 'Please enter the room number' }),\n      minLength(2),\n      validateRoomExists(),\n    ],\n    fullName: [required()],\n    details: {\n      category: [required()],\n      description: [required()],\n    },\n    email: [required()],\n    phone: [\n      applyWhenValue(\n        (request) => request.details.urgency === 'high' || request.details.urgency === 'critical',\n        [\n          required({\n            message: 'For urgent requests, please enter your phone number so we can call you back!',\n          }),\n        ],\n      ),\n    ],\n    root: [],\n  });\n```\n\n### Alternative D\n\nThe last alternative uses a form configuration object. It can define conditions and validators. It still assumes that each validator function always has access to the whole form context.\n\nWith this configuration in place, we can define conditions that we want to reuse. We can reference them in a type-safe way within `applyWhenValue` or just add a single-use predicate instead.\n\nWith this style, we can easily declare and understand our validators and even define conditions. What makes this even more useful is that the configuration object could be enhanced in the future if needed. \n\n```ts\n/*\n    Alternative D\n\n    This alternative makes the assumption, that a validator function always has access to\n    the whole form context, to be able to do cross-field validation\n\n    ***Pros:**\n    - fully declarative\n      - all validators for a given field are immediately visible\n    - fields are not repeated\n    - defining validators for form groups uses the exact shape as the value\n    - which field is targeted when using applyWhenValue is clear\n    - doing cross-field validation does not require special functions\n    - conditions can be defined once and reused across multiple fields\n      - applyWhenValue can reference a condition by key instead of repeating the predicate\n\n    ***Cons:**\n    - requires a reserved key to add validators to the whole form\n      - reserved keys have potential to collide with one required for business logic\n    - applyWhenValue now only targets a single field (but condition reuse mitigates repetition)\n  */\n  requestForm = form(this.request, {\n    conditions: {\n      isUrgent: (request: MaintenanceRequest) =>\n        request.details.urgency === 'high' || request.details.urgency === 'critical',\n    },\n    validators: {\n      buildingNumber: [\n        required({ message: 'Please enter the building number' }),\n        minLength(2, { message: 'Must have at least 2 characters' }),\n        validateBuildingExists(),\n      ],\n      roomNumber: [\n        required({ message: 'Please enter the room number' }),\n        minLength(2),\n        validateRoomExists(),\n      ],\n      fullName: [required()],\n      details: {\n        category: [required()],\n        description: [required()],\n      },\n      email: [required()],\n      phone: [\n        applyWhenValue('isUrgent', [\n          required({\n            message: 'For urgent requests, please enter your phone number so we can call you back!',\n          }),\n        ]),\n      ],\n      root: [],\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n\n### My opinion\n\nI think Alternative D is the most balanced overall. It makes the validation logic declarative and easy to reason about. The exception is when you want to ask \"What fields are required?\". In that case, you would need to use other means to quickly answer that particular question. I would argue, though, that this is a reasonable drawback, given that we would have a clear structure and remove a lot of ambiguity regarding the order or grouping of validators.\n\nThe use of a form configuration should allow for non-breaking changes when adding new features.\n\nI realize that this declarative style may result in a few more lines. For me, it is more important to easily understand the intent of a form and have a clear structure than to have complete flexibility. My biggest concern is that, with the current approach, you will have mental overhead just trying to understand what logic belongs where and to ensure you have the full picture.\n\nAll alternatives are pretty much designed with the existing functions in mind.

When the `@if` condition is true (rendering the `<a> `tag), the content intended for the `<a>` tag's projection slot is instead rendered in the subsequent `<button>` tag's projection slot, which resides in the inactive `@else` block.\n\nThis suggests that the content projection mechanism is not properly scoped to the active `@if` block when a non-selector `<ng-content>` is present in both branches.\n\n```\n// button-wrapper.component.ts\n\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-button-wrapper',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    @if (asLinkTag) {\n      <a [class]=\"buttonClass\" [href]=\"linkHref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n        <!-- FIRST <ng-content> SLOT (Expected to render here when asLinkTag is true) -->\n        <ng-content></ng-content>\n      </a>\n    } @else {\n      <button [class]=\"buttonClass\">\n        <!-- SECOND <ng-content> SLOT (Actual location where content is rendering) -->\n        <ng-content></ng-content>\n      </button>\n    }\n  `,\n})\nexport class ButtonWrapperComponent {\n  @Input() asLinkTag = false;\n  @Input() buttonClass = 'p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded';\n  @Input() linkHref = '#';\n}\n```\n\n<img width=\"278\" height=\"325\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d48816-de66-4331-b7fd-20d6aa96ef9d\" />\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.9\nNode: 24.1.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.3.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.10\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.9\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.9\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.9\n@angular/build               20.3.9\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.12\n@angular/cli                 20.3.9\n@schematics/angular          20.3.9\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.9.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65208","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Projected Content Renders in Inactive @else Block When Using New Control Flow\" (#65208)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3629362571","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-15T22:35:03","Actor":"wein2011","Number":"31829","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vitest unit test fails when run with --include command option with relative path","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWith 21.0.0-rc.4, unit-test supports commands with absolute paths on Windows 11 such as:\n\n```\nng test --browsers ChromiumHeadless --ui --watch --include=\"C:\\myapp\\src\\app\\app.spec.ts\"\n```\n\nHowever, relative paths such as:\n\n```\nng test --browsers ChromiumHeadless --ui --watch --include=\"src\\app\\app.spec.ts\"\n```\n\nbuild but then error with:\n\n```\nNo test files found.

There is a setting that the  [documentation](https://material.angular.dev/components/menu/api#MatMenu) states will decide if the menu has a backdrop, but if it's opened via context menu, that config is ignored.\n\nI suggest that: \n\n1. `matContextMenuTriggerFor` allows backdrop, but in cases where the setting is not defined, uses no backdrop as a default. \n2. `matMenuTriggerFor` adopts the same \"click outside\" to close, even when there's no backdrop.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/context-menu-backdrop?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Clicking the button opens as a menu (with backdrop)\n2. Rightclicking the context hook opens as a context menu (without backdrop)\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- `matContextMenuTriggerFor` opens without backdrop, regardless of `matMenu.hasBackdrop` setting.\n- `matMenuTriggerFor` does not close on click outside when opened without a backdrop\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- `matContextMenuTriggerFor` opens without backdrop by default, but can have backdrop if `mat-menu` has `hasBackdrop`.\n- `matMenuTriggerFor` supports closing when click outside (probably opt-in behaviour to avoid breakages)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32350","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatMenu): Opening as context menu ignores hasBackdrop\" (#32350)"},{"Id":"3623975378","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-14T05:41:09","Actor":"some1awesome","Number":"32347","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button): fixes mat-icon svg size and visibility issues","State":"open","Body":"Updates Angular Components Button component styling for mat-icon-buttons and all mat-fab-button variants.

Clicking any of the red icon buttons will toggle a variable that controls whether the mat-button is in the DOM.  To view the problem make sure the button is toggled visible.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIcons will remain the same size and stay visible weather there is a material button in the DOM or not\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn Chrome: Some of the taller font awesome icons will be extra tall when a button is in the DOM and be the correct size when there are no buttons in the DOM.  Forcing sizes with css classes or direct styles does not impact the height of the icon when the material button is in the DOM.  Note that fa-building and fa-play are two examples of taller font awesome icons while fa-toolbox is normal size.  In Chrome fa-toolbox behaves how it should when the material button is in the DOM.\n\nHere is what it looks like when the button is toggled into the DOM in chrome:\n<img width=\"308\" height=\"61\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db757faf-e949-4b6e-ad27-138c0e5af16f\" />\n\nHere is what it looks like when the button is toggled out of the DOM in chrome:\n\n<img width=\"355\" height=\"55\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2934d422-3643-49e5-af80-2c581af318f9\" />\n\nIn Safari: All of the font awesome icons disappear entirely when the button is in the DOM\n\nHere is what it looks like when the button is toggled into the DOM in safari:\n\n<img width=\"331\" height=\"61\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df765795-e50a-40d2-9126-629a2c284eb1\" />\n\nHere is what it looks like when the button is toggled out of the DOM in safari\n\n<img width=\"209\" height=\"57\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/950ef70d-3de8-4c39-a12a-6489167cb53f\" />\n\nNote the fourth icon is visible in safari, this is a normal home icon from  material icons and I included it for reference.  The other three (fa-building, fa-play, and fa-toolbox) are all font awesome icons \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 20.3.10\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.11\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.10\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.10\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.13\n@angular/cli                    20.3.10\n@angular/material               20.2.13\n@schematics/angular             20.3.10\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\n\nBrowsers: Chrome and Safari\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32338","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Font Awesome Icons have styling problems when a mat-button is on the page\" (#32338)"},{"Id":"3622716168","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T20:31:04","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32335","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0-rc.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"21.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32335","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0-rc.2 release\" (#32335)"},{"Id":"3622710203","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T20:28:51","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.0.0-rc.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32334","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.0.0-rc.2\" with changelog.\" (#32334)"},{"Id":"3622688993","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T20:20:50","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32333","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.2.13 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32333","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.2.13 release\" (#32333)"},{"Id":"3622673804","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T20:19:14","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32332","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.13\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32332","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.13\" with changelog.\" (#32332)"},{"Id":"3622656567","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T20:09:32","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32331","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.0.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32331","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.0.0\" with changelog.\" (#32331)"},{"Id":"3622523041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T19:34:28","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32330","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): expose active from public api","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32330","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): expose active from public api\" (#32330)"},{"Id":"3622439210","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T19:16:16","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"32329","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/tree): only reset selected values if used in combobox","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32329","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(aria/tree): only reset selected values if used in combobox\" (#32329)"},{"Id":"3622417627","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T19:09:02","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32328","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): expose element","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32328","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): expose element\" (#32328)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-16T03:30:02.6761324Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1998}

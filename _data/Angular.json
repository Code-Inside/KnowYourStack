The `UrlSerializer` is supposed to do that job, but it cannot do it properly anymore because the `queryParams`  has already been serialized. For instance, if you want to pass an object into a `queryParam`, you will end up having a serialized string: `[object Object]`. There is [another ticket](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40937) suggesting allowing overriding this serializing.\r\n\r\nThe typing of `queryParams` is also confusing. Here is the type\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare type Params = {\r\n    [key: string]: any;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nWhile accessing the params through ParamMap returns a `string`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare interface ParamMap {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Reports whether the map contains a given parameter.\r\n     * @param name The parameter name.\r\n     * @returns True if the map contains the given parameter, false otherwise.\r\n     */\r\n    has(name: string): boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Retrieves a single value for a parameter.\r\n     * @param name The parameter name.\r\n     * @return The parameter's single value,\r\n     * or the first value if the parameter has multiple values,\r\n     * or `null` when there is no such parameter.\r\n     */\r\n    get(name: string): string | null;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Retrieves multiple values for a parameter.\r\n     * @param name The parameter name.\r\n     * @return An array containing one or more values,\r\n     * or an empty array if there is no such parameter.\r\n     *\r\n     */\r\n    getAll(name: string): string[];\r\n    /** Names of the parameters in the map. */\r\n    readonly keys: string[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhile I understand that we have at some point to serialize the `queryParams`, the current way is not flexible enough for my needs.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe first solution I do think about is keeping the queryParams as is, i.e. without serializing them. A Tree has Params which are of type `Record<string, any>` just keep them so that we can retrieve the original value later.\r\n\r\nBut I can imagine there are other problems because we want to keep a snapshot of the routes, and we therefore need to serialize those parameters at some point (and this is not even related to the URL but the internal snapshot). I can think there are other as well as internal `queryParams` comparison from one route to another (where strings or array of strings are easy to compare). Keeping both (the original and the stringified version) would also perhaps be an overkill. Note that I did not browse all the code base to see if there are such problems.\r\n\r\nThe cleanest solution I can think about would be to delegate the job of serializing to a service 'ParamsSerializer' so that we can then inject any logic we want.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// bonus to explicitly show those are generically parsable values, but using \"Params\" would be fine too\r\ntype JSONValue =\r\n    | string\r\n    | number\r\n    | boolean\r\n    | { [x: string]: JSONValue }\r\n    | Array<JSONValue>;\r\n\r\nclass ParamsSerializer {\r\n  serialize(params: Params): string\r\n  parse(stringParams: string): Record<string, JSONValue>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe serialize method would be called [at that point](https://github.dev/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/create_url_tree.ts#L185-L187)\r\n\r\nAnd the parse function to reconstruct the Params (there is no equivalent in the code yet). The ParamMap would also be able to return the JSONValue instead (currently `string`).\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare interface ParamMap {\r\n...\r\n    get(name: string): JSONValue | null;\r\n    getAll(name: string): JSONValue[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhat I do really want is to pass any object within the `queryParams` and being able to retrieve it back later.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 problems to solve:\r\n1. The object we pass must be serializable: we need a generic or custom way to convert our object to a JSONValue one. \r\n2. Once serialized, they should fit the URL : This is the responsibility of the [UrlSerializer](https://angular.io/api/router/UrlSerializer)\r\n3. We should be able to revive those objects from the URL: \r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm simply passing queryParams which are of type `Record<string, string>;`\r\nI just manually serialize my objects and then use my custom parser function.\r\n\r\nHere is my helper:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport JsonURL from '@jsonurl/jsonurl';\r\nimport { mapValues } from 'lodash';\r\nimport { JSONValue } from '@medulla-core/utils/json';\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root',\r\n})\r\nexport class QueryParamsService {\r\n  static encode(queryParams?: Record<string, JSONValue>): Record<string, string> | undefined | null {\r\n    if (queryParams === undefined) {\r\n      return undefined;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (queryParams === null) {\r\n      return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return mapValues(queryParams, (value) => JsonURL.stringify(value, { noEmptyComposite: true }));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static decode(queryParams?: Record<string, string>): Record<string, JSONValue> {\r\n    if (queryParams === undefined) {\r\n      return undefined;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (queryParams === null) {\r\n      return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return mapValues(queryParams, (value) => JsonURL.parse(value, { noEmptyComposite: true }));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using [jsonurl](https://jsonurl.org/) to keep a valid, consistent and human readable json into the URL.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is an example of the `queryParams` of a `userSearch` page:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nqueryParams = {\r\nfilter: {name:\"\", surname:\"\"},\r\npage: {offset: 0, count: 100},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I try passing this object to the queryParams, without my helper I will get something like this:\r\n\r\n`?filter=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&page=%5Bobject%20Object%5D`\r\n\r\nUsing my helper, the queryParams becomes:\r\n```typescript\r\nqueryParams = {\r\nfilter: \"(name:'',surname:'')\",\r\npage: \"(offset:0,count:100)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is url friendly and gives me this clean url\r\n\r\n`?filter=(name:'',surname:'')&page=(offset:0,count:100)`\r\n\r\nTo get back the object, I'm simply sending the parsed queryParams into my helper.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this ticket is to automate this process without using my helper.\r\n\r\nSide note: As queryParams are related to routes, perhaps it be consistent to allow registering an optional parser / serialize to the routes themselves. We could then even register a reviver for the activeroute's query params.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for object in queryParams\" (#47307)"},{"Id":"1357059709","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-31T10:04:23","Actor":"fellmann","Number":"47306","RawContent":null,"Title":"TypeError for FromGroup.removeControl","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nFormControl.removeControl shows type error when TypeScript strictNullChecks is enabled.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst group = new FormGroup({\"a\": new FormControl(\"test\")})\r\ngroup.removeControl(\"a\")\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-hy5qkn?file=tsconfig.json,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError in src/app/app.component.ts (14:5)\r\nNo overload matches this call.\r\nOverload 1 of 2, '(this: FormGroup<{ [key: string]: AbstractControl<any, any>; }>, name: string, options?: { emitEvent?: boolean | undefined; } | undefined): void', gave the following error.\r\nThe 'this' context of type 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string | null>; }>' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'FormGroup<{ [key: string]: AbstractControl<any, any>; }>'.\r\nProperty '\"a\"' is missing in type '{ [key: string]: AbstractControl<any, any>; }' but required in type '{ a: FormControl<string | null>; }'.\r\nOverload 2 of 2, '(name: never, options?: { emitEvent?: boolean | undefined; } | undefined): void', gave the following error.\r\nArgument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.1\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router     \r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------  \r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.8.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47306","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TypeError for FromGroup.removeControl\" (#47306)"},{"Id":"1357022169","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-31T08:54:38","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"47305","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 4a6e62d46","State":"open","Body":"Updating [angular#main](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main) from [cli-builds#main](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/tree/main).\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/14d4d528c...4a6e62d46):\n\n**Modified**\n- help/generate.json","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47305","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 4a6e62d46\" (#47305)"},{"Id":"1356528732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-31T00:35:25","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"47302","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): drop unnecessary `srcset` sanitization","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates runtime and compiler to drop unnecessary `srcset` sanitization.

When the view is change-detected, the following function is used:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L483-L505\r\nwhich is similar to the `detectChangesInternal` used elsewhere (for non-root views):\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L1806-L1817\r\nThe mentioned functions are very similar, but they have one big difference: the function for non-root views reports errors to the ErrorHandler, when a root view one does not.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in most cases, since there are other points at which the error is intercepted and reports. For example, this function is used during the bootstrap: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/application_ref.ts#L594.\r\nand also when an error happens in a listener:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/listener.ts#L220\r\n\r\nHowever when an APIs like `createComponent` (and I suspect `ViewContainerRef.createComponent`) are used after the bootstrap and outside of listeners, errors would not be reported to the `ErrorHandler`. Here is a TestBed test to illustrate this:\r\n```\r\n   fit('should report errors to the ErrorHandler', () => {\r\n      @Component({\r\n        standalone: true,\r\n        template: '...',\r\n      })\r\n      class StandaloneComponent {\r\n        ngOnInit() {\r\n          throw new Error('!');\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      let errorHandlerInvoked = false;\r\n      const hostElement = document.createElement('div');\r\n      const parentInjector = TestBed.inject(EnvironmentInjector);\r\n      const errorHandler = {\r\n        handleError: () => {\r\n          errorHandlerInvoked = true;\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n      const providers = [\r\n        {provide: ErrorHandler, useValue: errorHandler},\r\n      ];\r\n      const environmentInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(providers, parentInjector);\r\n      const componentRef = createComponent(StandaloneComponent, {hostElement, environmentInjector});\r\n      expect(() => {\r\n        componentRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();\r\n      }).toThrow();\r\n\r\n      // This assert fails (ErrorHandler is never invoked):\r\n      expect(errorHandlerInvoked).toBe(true);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nIt's easy to add a logic to report errors:\r\n```\r\n--- a/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts\r\n+++ b/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts\r\n@@ -497,6 +497,9 @@ export function renderComponentOrTemplate<T>(\r\n       renderView(tView, lView, context);\r\n     }\r\n     refreshView(tView, lView, templateFn, context);\r\n+  } catch (error) {\r\n+    handleError(lView, error);\r\n+    throw error;\r\n   } finally {\r\n     if (!checkNoChangesMode && !creationModeIsActive && rendererFactory.end) {\r\n       rendererFactory.end();\r\n```\r\nHowever this would have consequences for the mentioned cases (bootstrapping, event listeners invocation) and would result in reporting an error to the ErrorHandler twice. As a possible solution, we can probably mark (via monkey-patching) errors that we've reported and skip reporting it the second time.\r\n\r\nAnother API that would likely be affected: `TestBed.createComponent`.

While this is great for certain use cases, many RxJS use cases require us to consume the control state reactively.\r\n\r\nWhile working with NgRx, RxJS and Angular, we often still need \"regular\" observables, which automatically replay the latest state, whenever you subscribe to them. Additionally a lot of developers are searching for ways to bind to variables like `dirty`,  `invalid` reactively.\r\n\r\nWe were previously using the [`ngneat/reactive-forms`](https://github.com/ngneat/reactive-forms) which offered a great developer experience, by providing these additional observables to ease our lives.\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy to **contribute a solution** that simply operates on top of the existing `valueChanges` and `statusChanges` to make the API of the `AbstractControl` more accessible.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAddition of cold observables, which replay the latest value, whenever they are subscribed to:\r\n- `value$` Similar to `valueChanges` but emits on subscription the latest value.\r\n- `dirty$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `pristine$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `touched$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `untouched$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `enabled$`: Mirrors the enabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `disabled$`: Mirrors the disabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `valid$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `invalid$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEvery dev can write their own set of helper functions to reactively select attributes from the `AbstractControl`:\r\n\r\n[Example App](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mwxdxl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Findex.html)\r\n```ts\r\nexport function selectFormValue<Value, RawValue extends Value>(\r\n  control: AbstractControl<Value, RawValue>\r\n): Observable<Value> {\r\n  return defer(() => control.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(control.value)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Additional Observables for `AbstractControl`: `value$`, `dirty$`, `invalid$`, ...\" (#47289)"},{"Id":"1353864524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T07:55:25","Actor":"kbrilla","Number":"47287","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginal issue: #27936\r\n\r\nWhen there are 2 routes: child and parent, each has a resolved property, the data form the parent resolve is not available in child resolver (still available in ChildComponent though as expected)\r\n\r\n[Original Angular v6 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-7xwxls?file=src%2Findex.html)\r\n[Actual Angualr v14 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-4hynrm?file=src/app/app.module.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n`data` parameter of `route` should follow `paramsInheritanceStrategy`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe resolve data from the parent can still be accessed as\r\n```\r\nclass ChildResolver {\r\n  resolve(route) {\r\n    const parentData = route.parent.data;\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nbut this looks like a hack","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver \" (#47287)"},{"Id":"1353494195","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-28T23:07:30","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"47285","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(animations): make sure that the animation function delay is applied","State":"open","Body":"make sure that when an animation is defined via the `animation` function\r\n(and used via `useAnimation`) and a delay has been provided then that\r\ndelay gets correctly applied\r\n\r\nresolves #47283\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 9\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter updating our angular app from 9 to 14, stepwise, and fixing all the compilation errors, I was finally able to compile and run the app locally with `ng serve`. All network requests are functioning and pointed at the correct endpoints. When I build the app with `npm run build` which is `\"node --max_old_space_size=8000 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration production --base-href /app/ && npm run post-build\"` and serve it locally, it appears that all my network requests request url's are being replaced with the host url. For example, my login endpoint should be `https://requestapi.com/login` but every single api call has a request url as `http://localhost:4000/`. That's it, nothing append to the end of the url or anything.

([#&#8203;1930](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1930))\n\n    This release lowers `for await` loops to the equivalent `for` loop containing `await` when esbuild is configured such that `for await` loops are unsupported. This transform still requires at least generator functions to be supported since esbuild's lowering of `await` currently relies on generators. This new transformation is mostly modeled after what the TypeScript compiler does. Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    async function f() {\n      for await (let x of y)\n        x()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The code above will now become the following code with `--target=es2017` (omitting the code for the `__forAwait` helper function):\n\n    ```js\n    async function f() {\n      try {\n        for (var iter = __forAwait(y), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = await iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n          let x = temp.value;\n          x();\n        }\n      } catch (temp) {\n        error = [temp];\n      } finally {\n        try {\n          more && (temp = iter.return) && await temp.call(iter);\n        } finally {\n          if (error)\n            throw error[0];\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically fix invalid `supported` configurations ([#&#8203;2497](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2497))\n\n    The `--target=` setting lets you tell esbuild to target a specific version of one or more JavaScript runtimes such as `chrome80,node14` and esbuild will restrict its output to only those features supported by all targeted JavaScript runtimes. More recently, esbuild introduced the `--supported:` setting that lets you override which features are supported on a per-feature basis. However, this now lets you configure nonsensical things such as `--supported:async-await=false --supported:async-generator=true`. Previously doing this could result in esbuild building successfully but producing invalid output.\n\n    Starting with this release, esbuild will now attempt to automatically fix nonsensical feature override configurations by introducing more overrides until the configuration makes sense. So now the configuration from previous example will be changed such that `async-await=false` implies `async-generator=false`. The full list of implications that were introduced is below:\n\n    -   `async-await=false` implies:\n        -   `async-generator=false`\n        -   `for-await=false`\n        -   `top-level-await=false`\n\n    -   `generator=false` implies:\n        -   `async-generator=false`\n\n    -   `object-accessors=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-accessor=false`\n\n    -   `class-field=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-field=false`\n\n    -   `class-static-field=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-static-field=false`\n\n    -   `class=false` implies:\n        -   `class-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-brand-check=false`\n        -   `class-private-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-method=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-method=false`\n        -   `class-static-blocks=false`\n        -   `class-static-field=false`\n\n-   Implement a small minification improvement ([#&#8203;2496](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2496))\n\n    Some people write code that contains a label with an immediate break such as `x: break x`. Previously this code was not removed during minification but it will now be removed during minification starting with this release.\n\n-   Fix installing esbuild via Yarn with `enableScripts: false` configured ([#&#8203;2457](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2457))\n\n    If esbuild is installed with Yarn with the `enableScripts: false` setting configured, then Yarn will not \"unplug\" the `esbuild` package (i.e. it will keep the entire package inside a `.zip` file). This messes with esbuild's library code that extracts the platform-specific binary executable because that code copies the binary executable into the esbuild package directory, and Yarn's `.zip` file system shim doesn't let you write to a directory inside of a `.zip` file. This release fixes this problem by writing to the `node_modules/.cache/esbuild` directory instead in this case. So you should now be able to use esbuild with Yarn when `enableScripts: false` is configured.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;jonaskuske](https://togithub.com/jonaskuske).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>microsoft/node-jsonc-parser</summary>\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;320-2022-08-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n\\=================\n\n-   update the version of the bundled Javascript files to `es2020`.\n-   include all `const enum` values in the bundled JavaScript files (`ScanError`, `SyntaxKind`, `ParseErrorCode`).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.3`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0263-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0262v0263-2022-08-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.2...v0.26.3)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   delay guess encoded ([#&#8203;216](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/216)) ([69b13c7](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/69b13c7a09af742e4f31cf419e8f96e6db32ab5a))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.54.6`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1546)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.54.5...1.54.6)\n\n-   Fix a bug where a `@media` query could be incorrectly omitted from a\n    stylesheet if it had multiple levels of nested `@media` queries within it\n    *and* the inner queries were mergeable but the outer query was not.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.10.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4101-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4100v4101-2022-08-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.10.0...v4.10.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The scripts tag (for runtime, polyfills and main) in the index.html are missing. \r\n\r\nI use the \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\" with the Webpack CompressionPlugin. To not have the compressed and uncompressed files in the dist directory, the 'deleteOriginalAssets' property is set to true. If 'deleteOriginalAssets' is set to false, the build is working fine.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Set up a new project with angular cli (no routing, css)\r\n`ng new repro-app`\r\n3. Add in package.json in \"devDependencies\": \r\n```\r\n\"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\":\"^14.0.1\",\r\n\"compression-webpack-plugin\":\"^10.0.0\",\r\n```\r\n5. Add a new file in root directory called 'extra-webpack.config.js' \r\n6. Write this code into 'extra-webpack.config.js': \r\n```\r\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    plugins: [\r\n        new CompressionPlugin({\r\n            deleteOriginalAssets: true,\r\n        })\r\n    ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n7. In angular.json change the builder in build to `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`\r\n8. Add the option in build:             \r\n```\r\n\"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n              \"path\": \"./extra-webpack.config.js\"\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n9. Run `npm i`\r\n10. Run `npm run build`\r\n11. In the dist directory you will see the zipped files and the index.html with missing scripts tag. (Running npm run build with deleteOriginalAssets set to false, the index.html is fine).\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe script tags in index.html are missing:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<script src=\"runtime.dd33940cddb71537.js\" type=\"module\">\r\n</script><script src=\"polyfills.240ce46083334aa2.js\" type=\"module\">\r\n</script><script src=\"main.bed6caf36cdc29a3.js\" type=\"module\"></script>\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23817","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build not working correctly with CompressionWebpackPlugin and property 'deleteOriginalAssets'\" (#23817)"},{"Id":"1353992278","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T23:38:19","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"23816","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency puppeteer to v17","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [puppeteer](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) | devDependencies | major | [`16.2.0` -> `17.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/puppeteer/16.2.0/17.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1700-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1620v1700-2022-08-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v16.2.0...v17.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   remove `root` from `WaitForSelectorOptions` ([#&#8203;8848](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8848))\n-   internalize execution context ([#&#8203;8844](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8844))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   allow multiple navigations to happen in LifecycleWatcher ([#&#8203;8826](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8826)) ([341b669](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/341b669a5e45ecbb9ffb0f28c45b520660f27ad2)), closes [#&#8203;8811](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8811)\n-   internalize execution context ([#&#8203;8844](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8844)) ([2f33237](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/2f33237d0443de77d58dca4454b0c9a1d2b57d03))\n-   remove `root` from `WaitForSelectorOptions` ([#&#8203;8848](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8848)) ([1155c8e](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1155c8eac85b176c3334cc3d98adfe7d943dfbe6))\n-   remove deferred promise timeouts ([#&#8203;8835](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8835)) ([202ffce](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/202ffce0aa4f34dba35fbb8e7d740af16efee35f)), closes [#&#8203;8832](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8832)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

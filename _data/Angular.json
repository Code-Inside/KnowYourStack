With 18.2.8 we would need to chain two `:not`s together to get the same effect (`&:not(&.foo):not(&.bar)`).

components","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a component uses @ContentChild or @ContentChildren should is able to access the content elements by queries and interact with the directive/component instance.\n\nThe same **should work also** when the child component is created dynamic.\n\n\nAssuming you have the following host:\n\n_Host Component_\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `\n    <h1> Classic projection </h1>\n    <app-parent>\n      <app-child></app-child>\n    </app-parent>\n    <h1>Dynamic</h1>\n    <app-parent>\n      <ng-container #host></ng-container>\n    </app-parent>\n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit{\n  title = 'testProjection';\n\n  @ViewChild('host', {static: true, read: ViewContainerRef}) host!: ViewContainerRef;\n\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    this.host.createComponent(ChildComponent)\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd a parent component querying the childrens:\n\n_Parent Component_\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-parent',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,\n})\nexport class ParentComponent implements AfterContentInit{\n\n  @ContentChild(ChildComponent) child?: ChildComponent;\n\n  @ContentChildren(ChildComponent) children?: QueryList<ChildComponent>;\n\n  ngAfterContentInit(): void {\n    console.log(\"child component\", this.child);\n    console.log(\"children component\", this.children);\n    this.children?.changes.subscribe(\n      (children) => {\n        console.log(\"children changed\", children)\n      }\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd a child component injecting his parent\n\n_Child Component_\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  template: `<p>child works!</p>`,\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(parent: ParentComponent) {\n    console.log(\"parent component\", parent);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe \"classic projection\" example will work as intended, while the children created by the host component won't work inside the @Content queries.\n\n\nThe first example does resolve:\n- @ContentChild\n- @ContentChildren [1]\n- parent injection trough construction of ChildComponent\n\nThe second example only resolve:\n- parent injection trough construction of ChildComponent\n\n\nBoth the examples does render correctly, what is really missing is that any access to ChildComponent from the ParentComponent will not work in the dynamic case and breaks most of the compositions that does interacts with their content childrens.\n\n_Rendered html_\n```html\n<app-root _nghost-owl-c2=\"\" ng-version=\"15.2.10\">\n    <app-parent _ngcontent-owl-c2=\"\">\n        <app-child _ngcontent-owl-c2=\"\"><p>child works!</p></app-child>\n    </app-parent>\n    <h1 _ngcontent-owl-c2=\"\">Dynamic</h1>\n    <app-parent _ngcontent-owl-c2=\"\">\n        <app-child><p>child works!</p></app-child><!--ng-container--></app-parent>\n</app-root>\n```\n\n\nI dont know the internal limitations that makes this trivial example not working, but this r**eally hinders the capabilities of the framework** when it comes to dynamicly render components.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow content queries to resolve directives and components from content also when they are created dynamically but they match the same `ProviderToken`.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe component may only uses `child -> parent` injection instead of content queries or use custom mechanism for handling queries.\n\nUsing `child -> parent` relationship can only be achived by design of the component's composition, so it won't necessarly works with all components from third parties (ex. Material).\n\nCustom mechanism again can only be achived by design of the component's composition and also may not be optimal or implemented in consistent ways by library authors.\n\n\nYou can find the example in this stackblitz:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-zdzhrg?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58218","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for content queries on dynamic components\" (#58218)"},{"Id":"2590986887","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T12:28:01","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58216","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): clean up logic that marks decorator as standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Cleans up the logic that was marking a decorator as standalone after some of the recent changes by:\r\n* Reusing some of the existing logic instead of duplicating it.\r\n* Ensuring that we don't drop cases like an explicit `standalone: true`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58216","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(migrations): clean up logic that marks decorator as standalone\" (#58216)"},{"Id":"2591011606","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T09:47:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58217","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix CI failures","State":"closed","Body":"Includes the following changes to fix the broken CI:\r\n\r\n### fix(compiler): handle typeof expressions in serializer\r\nFixes that some changes which landed at the same time caused a compilation error in the serialized.\r\n\r\n### test(compiler-cli): fix broken test\r\nFixes a test that broke because a pipe wasn't marked explicitly as `standalone: false`.\r\n\r\n### test(compiler): update failing tests\r\nFixes some tests that started failing, because angular#58154 made it so placeholder-only messages are extracted while angular#58176 added some tests that only contain placeholders.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58217","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix CI failures\" (#58217)"},{"Id":"2590984314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T08:01:32","Actor":"devversion","Number":"58215","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"feat(compiler): add support for the `typeof` keyword in template expressions.

version 18.2.8 of `angular-cli` and other Angular packages, dependency resolution fails, citing conflicts with chokidar versions.  It appears that some are seeking `^4.0.1` while others seek `^3.5.2`.  This breaks all of our builds as `npm ci` is unable to resolve the differences.\n\nThe issue can be seen very simply by creating a new Angular application using `ng new my-app`.  After it initializes, run `npm ls chokidar` and observe multiple versions marked as `invalid`.

As this scss file is copied from a library present inside node_modules and pasted directly into our app, we cannot modify the path in scss. \n\nI already have node_modules as a value in my stylePreprocessorOptions in angular.json\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"../../images/profile-bg.png\" [plugin angular-css-resource]\n\n    <stdin>:10120:20:\n      10120 │ ...background: url(\"../../images/profile-bg.png\") top left no-r...\n            ╵                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.8\nNode: 22.6.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.7\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router, upgrade\n\nPackage                            Version\n------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1802.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.1002.0\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.1302.1\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.1802.7\n@angular-devkit/core               18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics         18.2.7\n@angular/cli                       18.2.8\n@schematics/angular                18.2.7\nng-packagr                         18.2.1\nrxjs                               7.8.1\ntypescript                         5.5.4\nzone.js                            0.14.3\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28638","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to resolve relative path in url in SCSS files after Angular 18 upgrade\" (#28638)"},{"Id":"2591265719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T09:34:06","Actor":"hci2","Number":"28645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Default generated favicon.ico doesn't work -> rename to png works","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen scaffolding a new Angular project via `ng new <PROJECT_NAME>` the generated `favicon.ico` does not work.

It also occurs sometimes during regular builds/`ng test`, especially when other concurrent jobs put load on the system.\r\n\r\nBy adding lots and lots of logging, I found the root cause, which is a race condition when the sass worker manages to call `findFileUrl` again in between `Atomics.store(..., 0, 1)` and `Atomics.notify(..., 0)` invocations - I left more details as a comment.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe race no longer causes failing builds. After being notified, the worker checks again that the signal is not set to 0, and waits for another `notify` if necessary, which will be the correct one.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nI verified that the second `Atomics.wait(..., 0, 0)` actually does something meaningful, by logging the return value. Under load, I observed two instances where the return value was `\"ok\"`, indicating that the signal was 0 at the time of the second `wait`, and the build would therefore have aborted without the change.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28630","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): avoid race condition in sass importer\" (#28630)"},{"Id":"2587670233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-15T16:24:30","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28635","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.26.13","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.26.12` -> `v3.26.13` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.26.13`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.12...v3.26.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.12...v3.26.13)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

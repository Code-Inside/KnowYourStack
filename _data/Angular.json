I have tried everything on the web to increase it's performance with luck. I used App Shell, Webpack and even changed my server to nginx to serve static content but it's the same. Also another problem that the page takes about 18 seconds to fully which is really huge. Although I am using i18n because the application it's multi language. When I used App shell, my TTFB decreased to 60 ms which is ideal but the probelm that the page only rendered in the static html for the homepage for the whole app. If i tried to analyze any route it will return the same html which will effect my SEO. I understand that I can use csr and google can index it but i don't want to target only google and can be indexed from any craweler.\r\nHowever, I tried using prerender instead of server side and it did it's magic and loaded the page very quickly but the problem that my web app is really huge have about 80k routes which is not logic. Although that I have a huge server that can store all of this but I thought that's would be stupid idea.

I have tried everything on the web to increase it's performance with luck. I used App Shell, Webpack and even changed my server to nginx to serve static content but it's the same. Also another problem that the page takes about 18 seconds to fully which is really huge. Although I am using i18n because the application it's multi language. When I used App shell, my TTFB decreased to 60 ms which is ideal but the probelm that the page only rendered in the static html for the homepage for the whole app. If i tried to analyze any route it will return the same html which will effect my SEO. I understand that I can use csr and google can index it but i don't want to target only google and can be indexed from any craweler.\r\nHowever, I tried using prerender instead of server side and it did it's magic and loaded the page very quickly but the problem that my web app is really huge have about 80k routes which is not logic. Although that I have a huge server that can store all of this but I thought that's would be stupid idea.

The example provided includes a library called components containing a component that imports moment.js and one that doesn't. When only the component that DOES NOT use moment is imported into the application the resulting application bundle will still contain moment. I have tried to force the build process to use esm5 instead of fesm 5 and this does not help. The only thing left referencing moment would be the metadata.json. This problem makes it difficult to build large component libraries using the cli due to the fact that all runtime transitive dependencies will be included in the final bundle whether they are used or not.

page](https://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples) has the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-checkbox [checked]=\"descendantsAllSelected(node)\"\r\n

`some`) during every change detection.

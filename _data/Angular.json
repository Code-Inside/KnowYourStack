I understand, a `ComponentFixture` has two ways of working: with, or without changes auto-detection.\r\n\r\nIn reality, setting `autoDetectChanges` to `false` (even though it's supposed to already be `false` by default) has the same (partial) effect as setting it to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

repro, you'll find three similar tests, for an OnPush component.\r\n- the first one doesn't call `fixture.autoDetechChanges()` at all (so it leaves it to false)\r\n- the second one call `fixture.autoDetechChanges(false)`\r\n- the third one call `fixture.autoDetechChanges(true)`\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that the second one should pass: it should behave exactly like the first one, because setting autoDetectChanges to false when it's already false (by default) shouldn't change anything.\r\n\r\nBut the second one fails for the same reason as the third one.\r\n\r\nYou can run the repro by doing \r\n\r\n```\r\ncd repro\r\nnpm i\r\nng test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI:

Rather, we need to declare the form in the component and separately instantiate it after the constructor has run, usually in the ngOnInit hook.\r\n\r\nSeparating the declaration steps from the initialization step can lead to the two types misaligning, which causes an error like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }>' is not assignable to type 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }>'.\r\n  Types of property 'controls' are incompatible.\r\n    Type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }' is not assignable to type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-4ld5bn?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\nThis is a small example, but already it gets hard to parse. The issue is that one of the form controls wasn‚Äôt marked as nonNullable during initialization, and `FormControl<string|null>` is not assignable to `FormControl<string>`. Now imagine you have a Form with multiple levels of nested FormArrays and FormGroups and one control is out of sync with its declaration. It is a nightmare to debug.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhen a FormGroup instance is not assignable to a variable of FormType, the error message should indicate the paths of the offending control(s) in both the instantiated and declared types. This could be done similarly to how TypeScript handles incompatible structured types:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype Declaration = {\r\n    a: string\r\n    b: {\r\n        b1: string\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Instantiation = {\r\n    a: string\r\n    b: {\r\n        b1: string | null\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet decl: Declaration\r\nlet inst!: Instantiation\r\n\r\ndecl = inst\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'Instantiation' is not assignable to type 'Declaration'.\r\n  The types of 'b.b1' are incompatible between these types.\r\n    Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string'.\r\n      Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n[TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/C4TwDgpgBAIhDGAbAhgJ2cAlgewHZQF4oBvAWACgoqpkAuKAZ2FU1wHMLqoAjesyrtW4BGekxbtO1AL4VZ5CqEhQAkribJcWDDnxF+XOo2asOAqrxJTBPUcYlsoAHyi4ArokTWo8+RUQQwFAAJgiI9HBIaDp4-oFQrEwAhPRqGlqYMbgUFKFIhAnqwEA)\r\n\r\nI say ‚Äúin both the instantiated and declared types‚Äù to catch the case where one type has more form controls than the other ‚Äì this case is handled by this error message in TS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'b' is missing in type 'Instantiation' but required in type 'Declaration'.(2741)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen two form controls differ in type, then the error message should unwrap the types of the controls and explain why they‚Äôre not assignable. In the example above, this might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }>' is not assignable to type 'FormGroup<{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }>'.\r\n  Types of property 'controls' are incompatible.\r\n    Type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string | null>; }' is not assignable to type '{ a: FormControl<string>; b: FormControl<string>; c: FormControl<string>; }'.\r\n       The types of 'c' are incompatible between these types.\r\n         Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string'.\r\n           Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56864","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve the type error message for unassignable form groups\" (#56864)"},{"Id":"2392057664","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T07:53:10","Actor":"Undestor","Number":"56863","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template of fixture is not updated using signals (in test)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn the following test scenario:\r\n```\r\ndescribe('Test with input', () => {\r\n\t@Component({\r\n\t\tstandalone: true,\r\n\t\ttemplate: `{{ htmlData }}`,\r\n\t\tchangeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n\t})\r\n\tclass TestComponentWithInput {\r\n\t\tdata = input<string>()\r\n\t\thtmlData?: string\r\n\t\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\t\teffect(() => {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.htmlData = this.data()\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tit('#1 should have \"foobar\" in template', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithInput)\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges() // <---- This is necessary\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n\r\n\tit('#2 should have \"foobar\" in template', () => {\r\n\t\tconst fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n\t\t\timports: [TestComponentWithInput],\r\n\t\t}).createComponent(TestComponentWithInput)\r\n\t\t//fixture.detectChanges() // <---- Template is not updated because of missing detectChanges\r\n\t\tfixture.componentRef.setInput('data', 'foobar')\r\n\t\tfixture.detectChanges()\r\n\r\n\t\texpect(fixture.debugElement.nativeElement.textContent).toContain('foobar')\r\n\t})\r\n})\r\n```\r\nOnly test no. 1 does work and test no. 2 will fail.

The test no. 1 fails (and throws an the error `NG0950: Input is required but no value is available yet`) because i need to set the input before using `fixture.detectChanges()` and the test no. 2 does fail because i have not used `fixture.detectChanges` before setting the input and therefore the template is not updated.\\\r\n\r\nI hope i was able to describe my dilemma :)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.4\r\nNode: 20.12.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.3.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.3\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.4\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.4\r\nng-packagr                      18.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.4\r\nwebpack                         5.92.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56863","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Template of fixture is not updated using signals (in test)\" (#56863)"},{"Id":"2391785174","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T04:38:25","Actor":"ashishnd","Number":"56861","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(forms): fix broken link to Forms package in API reference","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Specifically, our builder adds plugins to webpack for handling fonts and SVGs from assets, which are subsequently included in indexHtml, along with additional scripts.\r\n\r\nI attempted to use a `buildApplicationInternal` equivalent for esbuild, but I encountered difficulties retrieving fonts and SVG information in the `onEnd` callbacks to use later in `indexHtmlTransformer` - not all information about media files is returned in metafile.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for guidance on the best approach to take when working with esbuild, considering the need to maintain our existing logic.\r\nIs it save to use `buildApplicationInternal` in the future?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried to run the project with ng serve. However, instead of launching Vite, webpack is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis might be because `ng serve `uses the `isEsbuildBased` function for verification, which only checks:\r\n```\r\nfunction isEsbuildBased(builderName) {\r\n    if (builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:application' ||\r\n        builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild') {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni have my custom builder name there.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something here, but there is no documentation for these cases. As I am not an expert, it has been quite challenging to understand how this should work. I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to have the ability to obtain information about the processed media files and run ng serve with vite.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nTried to access the media folder in `onEnd`, but the files were not yet written.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28001","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Migrate cli builder based on Webpack to Esbuild\" (#28001)"},{"Id":"2391171656","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-04T16:17:30","Actor":"moniuch","Number":"27999","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow creating git local user with new project before making first commit","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nI need to keep multiple git identities on my computer.

I often forget run into situations where I create a new project with wrong identity.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe solution I'd prefer would be some sort of micro-routine that would allow creating local project `user.*` config and then make the initial commit utilizing it, without the need of using the commit skipping flag.\r\n\r\nImagine this syntax (just an example):\r\n\r\n  `ng new --git-local-user` or `ng new -G`\r\n\r\nThe script creates a new project, but before it gets to making git commit, it shows a radio-button menu:\r\n```\r\n(*) create local git user\r\n( ) use global git user (abcxyz)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSelecting create would prompt for user name and then user email and once done, make the first commit as it would normally do.\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nYou can either:\r\n\r\n1. `--commit false` and then manually: create local user, `git add .`, `git commit` \r\n2. Erase `git config --global user.*` entries to deliberately make the git fail, but this is kind of harsh\r\n\r\nNone of those offers nice Dx.\r\n\r\nWith just one new flag you'd get a nice and consistent cli behavior and would get the entire flow with some extra git helper routine.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27999","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow creating git local user with new project before making first commit\" (#27999)"},{"Id":"2391185074","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-04T13:18:19","Actor":"lucavimercati","Number":"28000","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n locale data not found for non \"en-US\" codes","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlocalize\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nInternationalization documentation followed: [here](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-overview)\r\nAfter set different locale ID from default value in \"sourceLocale\" or \"locales\" build section property inside angular.json, ng serve and ng build give the message \"Locale data for {language_id}-{locale_extension} cannot be found.\"\r\n\r\nCurrent angular.json file i18n section:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/118968946/8897fefd-ab38-41d0-acd6-e734ffe9c472)\r\n\r\nCurrent angular.json file build -> options section:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/118968946/8a1ec9ad-7631-4623-aac7-7875baf6779d)\r\n\r\nCurrent main.ts file after `ng add @angular/localize`:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/118968946/04b0aa7f-7223-414c-9104-6e940a2a4ca8)\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n‚ñ≤ [WARNING] Locale data for 'it-IT' cannot be found.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0)\n\n***This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.*** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.22.0` or `~0.22.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Revert the recent change to avoid bundling dependencies for node ([#&#8203;3819](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3819))\n\n    This release reverts the recent change in version 0.22.0 that made `--packages=external` the default behavior with `--platform=node`.  The default is now back to `--packages=bundle`.\n\n    I've just been made aware that Amazon doesn't pin their dependencies in their \"AWS CDK\" product, which means that whenever esbuild publishes a new release, many people (potentially everyone?) using their SDK around the world instantly starts using it without Amazon checking that it works first. This change in version 0.22.0 happened to break their SDK. I'm amazed that things haven't broken before this point. This revert attempts to avoid these problems for Amazon's customers. Hopefully Amazon will pin their dependencies in the future.\n\n    In addition, this is probably a sign that esbuild is used widely enough that it now needs to switch to a more complicated release model. I may have esbuild use a beta channel model for further development.\n\n-   Fix preserving collapsed JSX whitespace ([#&#8203;3818](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3818))\n\n    When transformed, certain whitespace inside JSX elements is ignored completely if it collapses to an empty string. However, the whitespace should only be ignored if the JSX is being transformed, not if it's being preserved. This release fixes a bug where esbuild was previously incorrectly ignoring collapsed whitespace with `--jsx=preserve`. Here is an example:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>\n\n    // Old output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo><Bar /></Foo>;\n\n    // New output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>;\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.3`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small533-2024-07-03-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.3.2...v5.3.3)\n\n-   fix: lazily evaluate \\__vite\\_\\_mapDeps files ([#&#8203;17602](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17602)) ([dafff4a](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/dafff4a)), closes [#&#8203;17602](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17602)\n-   fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;17590](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17590)) ([012490c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/012490c)), closes [#&#8203;17590](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17590)\n-   fix(lib): remove pure CSS dynamic import ([#&#8203;17601](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17601)) ([055f1c1](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/055f1c1)), closes [#&#8203;17601](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17601)\n-   fix(proxy): replace changeOrigin changes in 5.3.0 with new rewriteWsOrigin option ([#&#8203;17563](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17563)) ([14c3d49](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/14c3d49)), closes [#&#8203;17563](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/17563)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nüìÖ **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nüö¶ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I currently got rid of the problem creating a wrapper for the list and manually triggering the resize event if the component is visible:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nconstructor(public _eRef: ElementRef, private ngZone: NgZone) { }\r\n\r\nngAfterViewInit() {\r\n  this.observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {\r\n    entries.forEach(entry => {\r\n      if (entry.isIntersecting) {\r\n        this.triggerResizeEvent();\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n  this.observer.observe(this._eRef.nativeElement)\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate triggerResizeEvent() {\r\n  this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\r\n    window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-57cqqc?file=src%2Fapp%2Fviewport-error.component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. open the mat-menu\r\n2. the viewport is half empty\r\n3. resize the window\r\n4. viewport filled properly\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe viewport should be completely filled with options\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe viewport is not fully filled.

For this, I used a **mat-autocomplete** on a **mat-input**, and a **mat-chip-grid** to display the values. To handle the input state, there is a signal with two-way binding using [(ngModel)]. \r\n\r\nIn this particular case, it seems that updating the signal linked to the ngModel does not update the input value.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**StackBlitz link**: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview#chips-autocomplete (the stackblitz from the official documentation showcase this bug)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Type the letter 'a'\r\n2. Click on 'Apple' to add the apple to the multi-selection\r\n3. Despite the signal being set to an empty string, the input is still displaying 'a'\r\n\r\n_Note: the signal state is correctly used to filter, which means that clicking on the input will display all values (despite the displayed 'a', which should supposedly be used to filter). For example, if you change the code to do `this.currentFruit.set('apple')` and reproduce this bug again, only the Apple element will be displayed when clicking a second time on the autocomplete (despite having only 'a' displayed)_ \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input should reflect the signal state correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input is not updated according to the signal state.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, probably?

you can no longer scroll the page.

I do see that they all have the reposition scrollstrategy and I've tried it with the noop one too but it just doesn't seem to work properly.\r\n\r\nI've only recently migrated to 18, but 17 also has the issue present as that is our current production version.\r\n\r\nI don't have a workaround yet either.

They give full control over theming:\r\n* Theme variable values are available at runtime.\r\n* Theme variable values can be adjusted at runtime.\r\n* Changing the entire theme is just a matter of supplying different values for the `sys-` variables.\r\n* Using any theme variable anywhere in the app can be done using the CSS variables. No need for importing any SASS logic from `@angular/material`.\r\n\r\nDefining and using a theme is as simple as:\r\n```scss\r\n@use \"@angular/material\" as mat;\r\n\r\n$theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n  (\r\n    color: (\r\n      theme-type: light,\r\n      primary: mat.$cyan-palette,\r\n      tertiary: mat.$magenta-palette,\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n    typography: (\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this one can easily define a bunch of such defined themes, and then load one based on user settings. Alternatively a backend endpoint could render the CSS file with the `sys-` variables.\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\nEverything in Angular Material nicely supports system-level themes, except the component theming mixins. \r\nWe still are still required to do something like:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n    @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not nice, because we now have generic styling code that needs to use a specific theme. \r\n\r\nA solution would be to allow passing something like this:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes((use-system-variables: true));\r\n  // Or available on mat.\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes(mat.$system-variables-theme);\r\n  // Or allow passing no theme\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nCreate your own `$system-variables-theme`, and use it:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  $system-variables-theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n    (\r\n      color: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n      typography: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($system-variables-theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nEasy and clean theming, with minimal theme files.\r\nI'm not sure whether the current workaround is 'ergonomic' enough. If it is, it should at least be added to the documentation.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(system-level-variables): Allow calling component mixins without specific theme\" (#29374)"},{"Id":"2387230462","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-03T05:46:51","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"29368","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix lint issue","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29368","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fix lint issue\" (#29368)"},{"Id":"2386927345","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T18:52:31","Actor":"Aljumaily","Number":"29367","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(M3): theme not being applied on mat-menu and mat-option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have the following working theme switcher code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n@import '@angular/cdk/overlay-prebuilt.css'; //copied it from a random place.\r\n\r\n@mixin patch-menu-colour($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.get-theme-type($theme)==dark {\r\n\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-panel,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-item-text,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-item,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-content {\r\n      --mat-menu-container-color: #00ff00 !important;\r\n      background-color: var(--mat-menu-container-color) !important;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @else {\r\n\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-panel,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-item-text,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-item,\r\n    .mat-mdc-menu-content {\r\n      --mat-menu-container-color: #ff00ff;\r\n      background-color: var(--mat-menu-container-color) !important;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n$light-theme: mat.define-theme(( //\r\n      color: ( //\r\n        theme-type: light,\r\n        primary: mat.$azure-palette,\r\n        tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\r\n      ),\r\n      typography: ( //\r\n        plain-family: \"Arial\",\r\n        brand-family: \"Arial\",\r\n        regular-weight: \"Arial\",\r\n      ),\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n$dark-theme: mat.define-theme(( //\r\n      color: ( //\r\n        theme-type: dark,\r\n        primary: mat.$magenta-palette,\r\n        tertiary: mat.$violet-palette,\r\n      ),\r\n      typography: ( //\r\n        plain-family: \"Playwrite US Modern\",\r\n        brand-family: \"Playwrite US Modern\",\r\n        regular-weight: \"Playwrite US Modern\",\r\n      ),\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n@include mat.color-variants-backwards-compatibility($light-theme);\r\n\r\n:root {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($light-theme);\r\n  @include mat.all-component-typographies($light-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($light-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($light-theme);\r\n  @include patch-menu-colour($light-theme);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.light-theme {\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($light-theme);\r\n  @include mat.all-component-typographies($light-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($light-theme);\r\n  @include patch-menu-colour($light-theme);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.dark-theme {\r\n\r\n  @include mat.all-component-colors($dark-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($dark-theme);\r\n  @include mat.all-component-typographies($dark-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($dark-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($dark-theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($dark-theme);\r\n  @include patch-menu-colour($dark-theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of the `mat-...` work by default except `mat-menu` and `mat-option`. \r\n\r\nI create a custom mixin to manually update the colour of `mat-menu` but it only works for the light theme because it is placed in `:root{ }`.

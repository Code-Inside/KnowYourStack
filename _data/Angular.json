Regardless, if you drop it into angular and attempt to use it in an HTML template, it's clear a normal iframe gets created despite the output HTML being correct. If you manually use element.innerHTML to inject the custom element it works properly.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ztlius\r\n\r\nTop frame is added with HTML templates, bottom with innerHtml injection. Both tags should function identically.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nPlacing breakpoints in the constructor of the x-frame-bypass class will confirm it is only instantiated for the bottom frame.

Digging into the Angular code it turns out that the `_compareWith` function in select_control_value_accessor.ts is being called an absurdly high number of times.\r\n\r\nI expected that this function would just be called no more than once for each item in the dropdown (i.e. loop through the options until a match is found). However, it is actually called exponentially more. E.g. for a dropdown with 1000 items and the 500th item bound to the ngModel, the function is called 501,001 times. If there are 3000 items in the dropdown and the 1500th item is selected, the `_compareWith` function is called 1,002,501 times. It gets even worse if an option nearer the end of the list is selected.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-select-performance?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nNote that I added a custom `compareWith` method in this example to log how many times it is called, but the performance is just as bad with the default internal comparison method.\r\n\r\nI think the problem stems from Angular's `SelectControlValueAccessor.writeValue()` method being called over and over for each individual option element that is rendered, rather than once after all the options are rendered.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 11.2.6\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThis is especially problematic for our users with slower mobile devices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41330","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Select dropdowns with ngValue binding perform far worse than expected\" (#41330)"},{"Id":"839034729","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-23T20:59:34","Actor":"beelia","Number":"41328","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update what-is-angular.md","State":"closed","Body":"Added today's date to freshen this guide article (updated review date)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So I removed the list of commands, it's about the underlying schematics engine and the way it resolves json schema files.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe are working a lot with Angular Schematics. Authoring the schema.json files per schematic is straight-forward. In addition we also use `quicktype` to create typescript definitions for a safer handling of the involved data. To complete this setup we also try to split schematics in order to reuse or test them individually. This means some of the schematics are private. \r\n\r\nThis approach of splitting schematics creates a lot of repetition in the actual schema.json files. It happens often that we repeat dozens of schema properties across multiple schematic as they are related and sharing the same schematic API surface.\r\n\r\nA common solution to make this easier is to use $ref and combine different definitions with `allOf`. This is also exactly what you are doing in the command definitions:\r\n\r\nSee here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular/cli/commands/build.json#L1-L16\r\n\r\nAnd it seems this is only possible for the command runner as you register the required custom uri handler for local files only in there:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular/cli/models/command-runner.ts#L124-L133\r\n\r\nThe `ng-cli://` is the prefix for the [json schema `$id`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#the-id-property) (like `\"$id\": \"ng-cli://commands/build.json\"`) and allows to refer to definitions without repeating the source json file. I don't fully understand why it's working and I might miss some processing step on your side. What I see are `$ref` and `$id` references and I would like to use them too.\r\n\r\nWe users of common schematics can't do that as the usual workflow (node for us) is not receiving any capabilities to load local schema files.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/81fcfb774f3a1f1ee83e1b4ba86ffcb323c8b331/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/workflow/base.ts#L69-L70\r\n\r\nIf I try to use a ref I see an error thrown by the registry as the file is not located in the web (http)\r\n\r\n> An error occured:\r\n> TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]: Invalid URL: my-definition.json\r\n>    at onParseError (internal/url.js:259:9)\r\n>    at new URL (internal/url.js:335:5)\r\n>   at node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.js:88:25\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nLet me allow to use the full power of schemas to tame our huge schema files and let me a allow to split them into smaller chunks. I would like to organize my schematics like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"allOf\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"my-definition.json#/definitions/part-a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"my-definition.json#/definitions/part-b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could solve this by adding a default URI resolver for local files to the `CoreSchemaRegistry` to allow the usual schematics (`yarn schematics @my/lib:do-something`) to be based on better organized json schemas. Is there a complexity I'm missing or would this be feasible at least ?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI consider the following alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. Create our own `$ref` & `flattening` approach to feed normalized `schema.json` files into the schematics engine while we can author the individual files. This is basically preprocessing an independent set of valid but better organized json schema files into a format that Angular understands. Also extract the typescript definition files from that final schema file to consume in the code.\r\n\r\n2. Author Typescript files and share them however I like. Then derive the schema file. Same as 1) but order reversed.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering my issue.

This fix is available from version 2.3.13 of `license-webpack-plugin`.\r\nVersions of `@angular-devkit/build-angular` 0.1200.x has `license-webpack-plugin` with 2.3.15 version which hasn't this issue.

([#&#8203;41059](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41059)) ([c49b280](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c49b28013a6c017c9afc73bbc00bb4fdcf15c70e))\n-   **compiler-cli:** add `useInlining` option to type check config ([#&#8203;41043](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41043)) ([09aefd2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/09aefd29045db77689f4dc16a6abae09a79cfb81)), closes [#&#8203;40963](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/40963)\n-   **core:** detect synthesized constructors that have been downleveled using TS 4.2 ([#&#8203;41305](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41305)) ([274dc15](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/274dc15452739e4fab2f647804a64d5b797cfed5)), closes [#&#8203;41298](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41298)\n-   **ngcc:** detect synthesized constructors that have been downleveled using TS 4.2 ([#&#8203;41305](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41305)) ([8d3da56](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8d3da56eda12070df1fb473c8609f3a94d77bfd6)), closes [#&#8203;41298](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41298)\n-   **router:** fragment can be null ([#&#8203;37336](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37336)) ([b555160](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b5551609fe02787641bdfdb0a6edfded413a3b52)), closes

ActivatedRouteSnapshot.fragment ([#&#8203;41092](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41092)) ([190fa07](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/190fa07b9a416defb581d2bf76d1deef7baefce6)), closes [#&#8203;37336](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37336)\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **animations:** DOM elements are now correctly removed when the root view is removed.\n    If you are using SSR and use the app's HTML for rendering, you will need\n    to ensure that you save the HTML to a variable before destorying the\n    app.\n    It is also possible that tests could be accidentally relying on the old behavior by\n    trying to find an element that was not removed in a previous test. If\n    this is the case, the failing tests should be updated to ensure they\n    have proper setup code which initializes elements they rely on.\n-   **router:** Strict null checks will report on fragment potentially being null.\n    Migration path: add null check.\n\n#### 11.2.7 (2021-03-24)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** correctly process multiple rules containing `:host` selectors ([#&#8203;41261](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41261)) ([f358d6b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f358d6b113e1a8215fcb50dbc3c5db8799699901)), closes

([#&#8203;41254](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41254)) ([8a53b54](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8a53b5454eea7b4db09498d9018687aa0b0ca7f3))\n-   **language-service:** show suggestion when type inference is suboptimal ([#&#8203;41072](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41072))

There are three things in particular which are a bit awkward:\r\n\r\n1. There is no way to create an Angular library (using the CLI) without using a monorepo structure. This may not be desired and makes library authorship a little more awkward.\r\n1. To use a monorepo structure, users are supposed to use `ng new --create-application=false`, which is a pretty awkward syntax and doesn't make clear that this is intended for a monorepo/multi-app workspace.\r\n1. Reevaluate the definition of \"workspace\". I can't speak for others, but I always interpreted a \"workspace\" as effectively a monorepository for Angular apps. Looking through [docs](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure), it seems that anything with an `angular.json` file is technically a \"workspace\", so `ng new` technically creates a workspace, even though it isn't a monorepo. I think this definition of \"workspace\" only really applies internally so we should think more critically about the language here.\r\n\r\nAdditional context: https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1373336274384293889\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'm thinking we could add an extra flag to `ng new` to decide whether to make a standalone application (`ng new --type app`), a multi-app workspace (`ng new --type workspace`, equivalent to today's `ng new --create-application=false`), or a standalone library (`ng new --type library`). Note that `ng new --type app` and `ng new --type library` both *technically* create a \"workspace\" per the above definition. We might want to either tweak the definition of \"workspace\" to mean \"a multi-app Angular repo\" or use something like `ng new --type empty-workspace`.\r\n\r\nThis would be distinguished from `ng generate` because `ng new` makes a new repository while `ng generate` works within an existing repository. Arguably we should merge `ng new` and `ng generate` (maybe inferring from file path context whether a new repository is required).\r\n\r\nSome of the broader questions we should discuss:\r\n\r\n1. How should we position Angular \"workspaces\"? Are they for monorepositories or not?\r\n2. How should `ng new` and `ng generate` work together or be merged?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nApparently you can use `ng-packagr` to generate a library without a workspace, but you're losing a lot of the benefits of the CLI by doing so: https://twitter.com/Splaktar/status/1373373386802479105","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20351","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better support `ng new` use cases\" (#20351)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"841293338","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-25T20:43:13","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"22346","RawContent":null,"Title":"Project import generated by Copybara.","State":"open","Body":"Merge when cl/364880888 is submitted","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22346","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Project import generated by Copybara.\" (#22346)"},{"Id":"841281353","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-25T20:25:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"22345","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(google-maps): add clusterer click event","State":"open","Body":"Adds an event that emits when a cluster has been clicked.\r\n\r\nFixes #22020.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22345","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(google-maps): add clusterer click event\" (#22345)"},{"Id":"841264990","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-25T20:02:05","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"22344","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: attempting to get webdriver tests running","State":"open","Body":"Me trying to set up WebDriver tests in bazel:\r\n![](https://mfw.kray.pw/fail/drinking-water.gif)\r\n\r\nI'm borrowing from an example that Keen setup (though it doesn't use bazel): https://github.com/kyliau/angular-wait/blob/main/test/test.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22344","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: attempting to get webdriver tests running\" (#22344)"},{"Id":"840252252","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-25T19:13:32","Actor":"rmegal","Number":"22339","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(MatTooltip): MatTooltip Disappears When Using MatTooltipClass","State":"closed","Body":"<!--------\r\n\r\nThe Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help.

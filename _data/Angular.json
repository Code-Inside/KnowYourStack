The Angular compiler generates factory objects which are exported but typically not used, as they are only needed for compatibility with View Engine. This results in top-level constructor calls, such as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const FooNgFactory = new NgModuleFactory(Foo);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`NgModuleFactory` has a side-effecting constructor, so this statement cannot be tree shaken, even if `FooNgFactory` is never imported. The `NgModuleFactory` continues to reference its associated `NgModule` and prevents the module and all its unused dependencies from being tree shaken. This effectively prevents all components from being tree shaken, making Closure builds significantly larger than they should be.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to wrap `NgModuleFactory` constructor with `noSideEffects(() => /* ... */)`, which tricks the Closure compiler into assuming that the invoked function has no side effects. This allows it to tree-shake unused `NgModuleFactory()` constructors when they aren't imported. Since the factory can be removed, the module can also be removed (if nothing else references it), thus tree shaking unused components as expected.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The problem was that closing an element would associate\r\nthe source span with the element at the top of the stack, however this may not\r\nbe the element that is actually being closed if some elements would be\r\nimplicitly closed.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by assigning the end source span with the element\r\non the stack that is actually being closed. Any implicitly closed elements that\r\nare popped off the stack will not be assigned an end source span, as the\r\nimplicit closing implies that no ending element is present.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a difference between self-closed elements such as `<input/>`\r\nand implicitly closed elements such as `<input>`. The former does have an end\r\nsource span (identical to its start source span) whereas the latter does not.\r\n\r\nFixes #36118\r\nResolves FW-2004","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38126","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler): properly associate source spans for implicitly closed elements\" (#38126)"},{"Id":"659962151","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T17:01:37","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"38129","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(language-service): Remove ls_rollup_bundle (#38086)","State":"closed","Body":"This is a patch PR for https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38086\r\n\r\n`ls_rollup_bundle` is no longer needed since we could invoke `ng_rollup_bundle`\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nBackground: language service runs rollup to produce a single file to reduce\r\nstartup time in the editor.

I'm guessing this has something to do with Ivy.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTS component:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.pug',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.sass']\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n\r\n  items = [\r\n    'one',\r\n    'two',\r\n    'three',\r\n    'four'\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPug template:\r\n```pug\r\nul\r\n  li(*ngFor=\"let item of items\") {{item}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the above example component and template in an Angular project. \r\n\r\nThe project builds without issue using `ng build` and `ng-build --prod`\r\n\r\nThe dev server starts without any issues using `ng serve` and the page renders as expected.\r\n\r\nOnce I start making changes to the project and the dev server automatically rebuilds, it prints the following error:\r\n`Property 'item' does not exist on type 'TestComponent'. Did you mean 'items'?`\r\n\r\nThe Angular application does appear to continue to work correctly and auto-rebuild on changes (printing that error every time), \r\nbut these false errors can potentially hide legitimate ones.\r\n\r\nThis happens with any variables generated with `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`.\r\n- `div(*ngIf=\"name$ | async as name\") {{name}}`: the `{{name}}` portion will generate an error\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs in both Angular 9 and 10.\r\n \r\nI have tried two different methods of adding pug support to my project, the error occurs with both:\r\n- Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack/v/9.2.0 to add a pug rule to webpack (using `apply-loader` and `pug-loader`)\r\n  - This method is demonstrated in the Minimal Reproduction section below\r\n- Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-cli-pug-loader/v/0.2.2\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is a repository resulting from the below steps: https://github.com/entith/ng-cli-pug-template-variable-issue\r\n\r\n1. run `ng new test --minimal --skip-tests --style sass --routing`\r\n2. switch to the generated project dir `cd test`\r\n3. run `npm i -D @angular-builders/custom-webpack pug pug-loader apply-loader`\r\n4. add `custom-webpack.config.js` file below\r\n5. edit `angular.json` as per the `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` documentation to use `custom-webpack.config.js`\r\n    - https://github.com/entith/ng-cli-pug-template-variable-issue/blob/master/angular.json\r\n8. run `ng g component test`\r\n9. edit the component and its template file to match the example above\r\n10. run `ng serve` and wait for project to build\r\n    - project should compile and server start with no errors\r\n    - page should load in browser as expected\r\n11. make any non-breaking change to a project file and save to trigger a rebuild\r\n    - ex: add a space at the end of a line in the `test.component.pug` file\r\n    - the project should rebuild, print `: Compiled successfully`, and then a moment later the error should print\r\n    - the page should have correctly refeshed\r\n        - if you make any template changes or changed the `items` array in the component, the page should correctly reflect these changes\r\n\r\n`custom-webpack.config.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = (config, options, targetOptions) => {\r\n  config.module.rules.push(\r\n    {\r\n      test: /\\.pug$/,\r\n      use: [\r\n        { loader: \"apply-loader\" },\r\n        { loader: \"pug-loader\" }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n \r\n  return config;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n> ng serve\r\n\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 20.6 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 141 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.15 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 12.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 3 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\nDate: 2020-07-17T20:50:39.902Z - Hash: 6232187f38b85c2dde79 - Time: 5839ms\r\n** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\nDate: 2020-07-17T20:50:44.744Z - Hash: d0680cf93388498b9aa8\r\n4 unchanged chunks\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 20.6 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nTime: 198ms\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n    \r\n    ERROR in src/app/test/test.component.pug:4:36 - error TS2551: Property 'item' does not exist on type 'TestComponent'.

We then have a shell application which collects information about all microservices and loads the frontends of those services into the shell so that they are usable for the user.\r\n\r\nEach service also comes with a standalone mode, which currently is just a really small angular app that wraps the module which is normally lazy-loaded into the shell.\r\n\r\nWith time the requirement came, that the standalone shells of the services should contain some basic functionalities, which the main shell also provides, like for example a logout button or a forbidden page.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to create a npm library which contains a StandaloneShellModule, which acts as the AppModule for those standalone shells and provides those basic functionalities i mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe original problem i faced, was that angular complained that my StandaloneShellModule is not part of the typescript compilation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/@company/shell/lib/standalone-shell.module.d.ts\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js):\r\nError: D:\\project\\frontend\\node_modules\\@company\\shell\\lib\\standalone-shell.module.d.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.\r\nThe missing file seems to be part of a third party library. TS files in published libraries are often a sign of a badly packaged library.

The compiled main.js looked something like this.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport * as __NgCli_bootstrap_1 from \"./../node_modules/@company/shell/lib/standalone-shell.module.d\";\r\nimport * as __NgCli_bootstrap_2 from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n    enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\n__NgCli_bootstrap_2.platformBrowser().bootstrapModule(__NgCli_bootstrap_1.StandaloneShellModule)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI searched for the place where this happened in the cli and found this file.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/transformers/replace_bootstrap.ts\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI do not provide a reproduction, because the issue is more of a question why the CLI is designed this way and why it does not support third party modules to be bootstrapped.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 14.4.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.1\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18286","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bootstrap Module cannot be from library\" (#18286)"},{"Id":"659485749","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T12:17:17","Actor":"born2net","Number":"18289","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade from ng 9 to ng 10 platformBrowserDynamic TypeError: this.store.select(...).filter is not a function","State":"closed","Body":"Upgrade from ng 9 to ng 10 HTTP error: platformBrowserDynamic TypeError: this.store.select(...).filter is not a function\r\n\r\nUPDATE: possibly related: https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/issues/4831\r\nbut I am not using this library.\r\n\r\n\r\nng 9 all is great when I publish final release via CLI.\r\n\r\nng 10 upg getting an error of :\r\n\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic TypeError: this.store.select(...).filter is not a function\r\n\r\nin browser\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.2\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core               10.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         10.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                       10.0.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout               9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/google-maps               9.2.4\r\n@angular/http                      7.2.16\r\n@angular/material                  9.2.4\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   9.2.4\r\n@angular/pwa                       0.803.26\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   10.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular                10.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1000.2\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.9.6\r\nwebpack                            4.43.0\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis is the error screen shot:\r\n\r\n![err](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090936/87465628-d45a2f80-c5c9-11ea-9ec9-3c9db7372729.PNG)\r\n\r\nrolling back to ng yields no issues.\r\n\r\nthis is my publish commands:\r\n\r\n![cmd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090936/87465731-feabed00-c5c9-11ea-85bc-b7e3b6fc36c1.PNG)\r\n\r\non publishing no errors, just some warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING in C:\\msweb\\studiopro-web\\src\\app\\containers\\adnet\\AdnetActions.ts depends on 'rxjs/add/operator/catch'.

Building separately with Webpack in Production mode works as expected.\r\n\r\nI investigated the problem a bit and now I'd say that it's because of \"sideEffects: false\" in their package.json. If I understand correctly side effects and \"pure\" modules are different things, or? Anyway, build optimizer's webpack loader marks some code as PURE when it isn't.\r\n\r\nAt first I've [created issue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3708) in Swiper's repo but maintainer says that Webpack's tree shaking works as expected.

I'm using ngx-socket-io but I'm trying to build the project using `es5`. I followed the guideline for building es5 from [here](https://angular.io/guide/deployment#differential-builds)\r\n\r\nI notice that angular is using even in es5 the bundle fesm2015 of ngx-socket-io causing this unknown error. \r\nWhen running ng serve it says `compiling \r\nngx-socket-io : es2015 as esm2015`\r\nI needed to use old safari in order to get the debugger working, so finding the precise error is kind of painful.\r\nnotice that basic app using `ng new projectName` is working on my ipad.\r\n\r\nI use this command `ng serve --aot --configuration es5 --host 192.168.XX.XX`\r\n\r\nthis is my first GitHub Bug report please let me know if I'm doing wrong or at the wrong place\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it on stackBlitz but basically you only have to install ngx-socket-io import it on your new project and make ng serve with host value for safari 9\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n![Capture d’écran 2020-07-17 à 13 28 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12628841/87784999-ada13080-c837-11ea-8926-7a1b886ca9eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nSafari 9\r\nIOS 9.3.5\r\nAngular 10.0.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Do any of these matter: operating system, IDE, package manager, HTTP server, ...?

The `setValue` function in the autocomplete uses a Promise to wait to set the value, and then change detection must be run afterwards to float the label. This is an issue we see internally at Google where screenshot diffs are off because clients don't understand the complex set of change detection and promises they are required to run.\r\n\r\nTo observe, insert and test the following in `autocomplete.spec.ts`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  it('should have reasonable expectations for setting the value and float the label', async () => {\r\n    const fixture = createComponent(AutocompleteWithLabel);\r\n    fixture.componentInstance.myFormControl.setValue('testValue');\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n\r\n    const input = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('input');\r\n    const formField = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('mat-form-field') as HTMLElement;\r\n    \r\n    // At this point, the form field's value has been been set, and we should expect that the\r\n    // input contains the right value and the label is floating.

This works, but the implementation still bugs me because the template is being stamped out in the view container, modifying the DOM, and then the drag preview element is immediately moved to bottom of the document body, modifying the DOM **again** (versus the other solution that only modifies the DOM once). Same idea for the placeholder template as well, how it is placed into the DOM and then immediately moved around (using `replaceChild`)...when it could just be put in the correct place from the start.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto made the following comment:\r\n>The idea behind inserting the view through the ViewContainerRef is to ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item. I agree that ideally we'd just create the element outside the DOM, but an alternate solution is to measure the element before the preview has been created.\r\n\r\nbut I am struggling to understand this comment (_\"ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item\"_). As far as I am aware, an injector cannot be specified when using `createEmbeddedView` and the injector used inside the preview template is simply the injector of the component in which the template is **defined**.\r\n\r\nIssue about this (still open...) from 3 years ago:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14935\r\n\r\nSo what would stamping a template out using \r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate, previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nhave anything to do with dependency injection? I feel like the answer is \"nothing\" but I might be misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto can you explain your comment in more detail as to why it is advantageous to use the view container and/or if something I've said above is not accurate?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20047","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"question(drag-drop): createEmbeddedView for drag preview/placeholder templates\" (#20047)"},{"Id":"662217361","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T20:12:41","Actor":"bmolinh","Number":"20046","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(map-info-window): Set Content Dynamically","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nFor it to be posible to set data to each marker placed on the google-map.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nReferencing a well described previous issue with a similar use case as mine:\r\n\r\nHello, is it possible to have a custom info window with data for each marker?

This markdown is processed with a third party library like [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) where we add a special link handler that replaces links with our custom elements (using Angular Elements). These elements trigger custom events that we want to handle in the parent component (the one that loaded the markdown).\r\n\r\nThe general idea is that we can let a 3rd party (non-Angular) library control the DOM and inject our Angular Elements but we want to keep communicating with these elements without having to dispatch bubbling events manually or using an indirection like a provider or state management etc...\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\n#### Solution A\r\n\r\n1. Create a new `CustomEventEmitter` where we can configure `bubbles` and `cancelable`: \r\n```ts\r\nnew CustomEventEmitter({bubbles: true, cancelable: false})\r\n```\r\n_We can't use `EventEmitter` because `bubbles` and `cancelable` will be simply ignored and confusing when not using Angular elements_\r\n\r\n2. Change `ComponentNgElementStrategy` in order to handle `CustomEventEmitter` differently instead of merging all emitters:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/eb9eebbb45352da6000560ee0988d9d59dce1254/packages/elements/src/component-factory-strategy.ts#L50\r\n\r\n3. Change `createCustomElement` in order to handle `bubbles` and `cancelable`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/eb9eebbb45352da6000560ee0988d9d59dce1254/packages/elements/src/create-custom-element.ts#L225-L228\r\n\r\n4. Change `createCustomEvent` to allow the control of `bubbles` and `cancelable`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8fd25d96142ba5bd6674ba19848b5477e9bbe861/aio/src/testing/dom-utils.ts#L4-L16\r\n\r\n5. [OPTIONAL] Should we deprecate `EventEmitter` usage with Angular elements? Allowing both can be confusing.\r\n\r\n#### Solution B\r\n\r\nCreate a new `CustomEventEmitter` which is an `EventEmitter` of type `EventEmitter<{bubbles?: boolean, cancelable?: boolean, detail?: T}>` so every event can have a different bubbling strategy... but that would be a surprising behavior so I am not a big fan of this one.\r\n\r\n#### Contribution\r\nI'll be more than happy to contribute with a PR if the solution is suitable.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nTrigger the event manually:\r\n```ts\r\nelementRef.nativeElement.dispatchEvent('myCustomEvent', {bubbles: true, detail: 'data'})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Somewhat related issues\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/2296\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39489","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow dispatch of bubbling custom events when using `@angular/elements`\" (#39489)"},{"Id":"732311524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-29T13:24:34","Actor":"celesteking","Number":"39488","RawContent":null,"Title":"routerLinkActive throwing error when there's no route match","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/router/RouterLinkActive\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm trying to apply some CSS rules based on class at the top app level (above the component level).\r\nI'm using `routerLinkActive` to do that. *Everything* is working fine, except when navigation happens, it throws an error:\r\n```\r\ncore.js:6241 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes.

When the user goes back and changes a selection, which then reduces the number of subsequent steps from what¬†it was before, I am experiencing an error. More specifically, this error occurs when the number of newly rendered steps is less than the¬†`selectedIndex` of the previously rendered steps.\r\n\r\nWhen the new steps are rendered, they are all closed (none are set as the `selectedIndex`). When I click on one of the steps I get this error:\r\n```\r\nERROR TypeError: Cannot set property 'interacted' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you click on a step it is calling this function which changes the¬†`selectedIndex` of the stepper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset selectedIndex(index) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† const newIndex = coerceNumberProperty(index);\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if (this.steps && this._steps) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // Ensure that the index can't be out of bounds.\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if ((newIndex < 0 || newIndex > this.steps.length - 1) &&\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode)) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† throw Error('cdkStepper: Cannot assign out-of-bounds value to `selectedIndex`.');\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if (this._selectedIndex != newIndex && !this._anyControlsInvalidOrPending(newIndex) &&\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† (newIndex >= this._selectedIndex || this.steps.toArray()[newIndex].editable)) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† this._updateSelectedItemIndex(index);\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† else {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† this._selectedIndex = newIndex;\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }\r\n¬† ¬† }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case, we are hitting the line that calls this function:\r\n\r\n```¬†\r\n_anyControlsInvalidOrPending(index) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† const steps = this.steps.toArray();\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† steps[this._selectedIndex].interacted = true;\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if (this._linear && index >= 0) {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return steps.slice(0, index).some(step => {\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† const control = step.stepControl;\r\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† const isIncomplete = control ?

So it is trying to set the `interacted` property of the previous step (the one you are leaving), but in this case that step no longer exists in the DOM due to the `ngIf` and, therefore, this line is causing an `undefined` error and crashing.\r\n\r\nSeems like there should be a way to account for this situation where the previously selected step no longer exists.

There are multiple themes included with material, none of which are listed in the documentation.

There's no clarity on how dividers etc. are themed and there's no real guidance on how to build custom themes. \r\n\r\nI would like to see:\r\n\r\n- a clear list of the maps that a theme requires to be complete\r\n- clear instructions on what maps should be used \r\n- a list of the maps that actually ship with the theme and guidance on how to use them\r\n- clearer SCSS functions to build the theme\r\n- clear guidance on how to build up custom typography suites\r\n- ideally a page that would allow you to put in colors and typography and would then generate the scss for it\r\n\r\nOR... at the very least it would be helpful for the documentation to at least state what it's not covering. There's so much stuff that you have to go rooting around in the source code to find (like what the existing color maps are and what the SCSS functions do).

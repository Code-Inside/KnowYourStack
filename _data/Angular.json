My understanding based on [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51938) is that this is expected behaviour, as a different iterator is returned from the map.keys() function on each call, however this suggests to me that the *ngFor directive is incompatible with iterators, which aside from being surprising to me, doesn't seem to be documented in either the [*ngFor documentation](https://angular.io/api/common/NgFor), or the troubleshooting documentation for [NG0100](https://angular.io/errors/NG0100).\r\n\r\nIf I've misunderstood the conversation from the previous issue, I'd appreciate if someone could provide an example of how to use *ngFor with an iterator such as the one returned by map.keys(). Obviously there is a trivial workaround to convert map.keys() into a list, but this doesn't resolve the core issue of *ngFor being unintuitively incompatible with iterators.\r\n\r\nIf I've correctly understood the information from the previous issue that *ngFor is incompatible with iterators, my request for a resolution to this issue would be to either:\r\n1. Update the *ngFor directive to be compatible with iterators such as the one returned from map.keys() without raising NG0100 \r\n2. Update the documentation for *ngFor and NG0100 to make it clear that the *ngFor directive is not compatible with iterators (it would also be nice to potentially raise a seperate error in this kind of situation, as it seems to be distinct from the typical error that NG0100 represents).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-kjsh2w?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked.

You can contact me at my mail: typicode at gmail :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n#### Introducing `husky init`\n\nAdding husky to a project is now easier than ever. Although the installation process was straightforward, it often required consulting the documentation.\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpm pkg set scripts.prepare=\"husky install\"\nnpm run prepare\nnpx husky add .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\n```\n\n##### v9\n\n```shell\nnpx husky init\n```\n\n#### Adding a New Hook\n\nAdding a hook is now as simple as creating a file. This can be accomplished using your favorite editor, a script or a basic `echo` command.\n\n##### v8\n\n```shell\nnpx husky add  .husky/pre-commit \"npm test\"\ngit add --chmod=+x .husky/pre-commit # On Windows\n```\n\n##### v9\n\n```shell\necho \"npm test\" > .husky/pre-commit\n```\n\n#### Further Size Reduction\n\n`v8` was already the most compact Git hooks manager at approximately `6kB`.\n\n`v9` takes this a step further, reducing the size to just `3kB`, likely making it the smallest devDependency in your toolkit.\n\n**To give you an idea of how small it is, the biggest file in the project is the MIT license 😄**\n\n#### More to Come\n\nAdditional features are in the pipeline for `v9`. Stay tuned :raised_hands:\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   **Enhanced security** with CI and npm `--provenance` for safer publishing.\n-   Added **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** support. Move `~/.huskyrc` to `~/.config/husky/init.sh` for centralized configuration.\n-   **Fixed permission issue for Windows-created hooks**; they no longer need to be executable.\n-   Removed `husky install`. Use `husky` or `husky some/dir` for the same functionality (deprecation notice to be added).\n-   Modified behavior when `.git` is missing; it now triggers a warning instead of failure.\n-   Replaced `HUSKY_DEBUG=1` with `HUSKY=2` for debugging.\n-   Updated the Husky API for module usage.\n-   Transitioned to `ESM` for module usage.\n-   Dropped support for Node 14 and 16.\n-   Revamped docs.\n\n#### How to Migrate\n\n`v9` is backward compatible with `v8`, allowing you to freely upgrade and migrate your hooks later.\n\n`package.json`\n\n```diff\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n-   \"prepare\": \"husky install\"\n+   \"prepare\": \"husky\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`.husky/pre-commit`\n\n```diff\n- #!/usr/bin/env sh\n- . \"$(dirname -- \"$0\")/_/husky.sh\"\nnpm test\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Two most popular interpretations are Babel and TypeScript. Yes [they are different](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1456118847937781764) (esbuild [deliberately follows TypeScript](https://twitter.com/evanwallace/status/1456122279453208576) by the way).\n\n    Previously esbuild normalized text to the TypeScript interpretation when the \"preserve\" JSX mode is active. However, \"preserve\" should arguably reproduce the original JSX text verbatim so that whatever JSX transform runs after esbuild is free to interpret it however it wants. So with this release, esbuild will now pass JSX text through unmodified:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    let el =\n      <a href={'/'} title='&apos;&quot;'> some text\n        {foo}\n          more text </a>\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=jsx --jsx=preserve)\n    let el = <a href=\"/\" title={`'\"`}>\n      {\" some text\"}\n      {foo}\n      {\"more text \"}\n    </a>;\n\n    // New output (with --loader=jsx --jsx=preserve)\n    let el = <a href={\"/\"} title='&apos;&quot;'> some text\n        {foo}\n          more text </a>;\n    ```\n\n-   Allow JSX elements as JSX attribute values\n\n    JSX has an obscure feature where you can use JSX elements in attribute position without surrounding them with `{...}`. It looks like this:\n\n    ```jsx\n    let el = <div data-ab=<><a/><b/></>/>;\n    ```\n\n    I think I originally didn't implement it even though it's part of the [JSX specification](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) because it previously didn't work in TypeScript (and potentially also in Babel?). However, support for it was [silently added in TypeScript 4.8](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/47994) without me noticing and Babel has also since fixed their [bugs regarding this feature](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/pull/6006). So I'm adding it to esbuild too now that I know it's widely supported.\n\n    Keep in mind that there is some ongoing discussion about [removing this feature from JSX](https://togithub.com/facebook/jsx/issues/53). I agree that the syntax seems out of place (it does away with the elegance of \"JSX is basically just XML with `{...}` escapes\" for something arguably harder to read, which doesn't seem like a good trade-off), but it's in the specification and TypeScript and Babel both implement it so I'm going to have esbuild implement it too. However, I reserve the right to remove it from esbuild if it's ever removed from the specification in the future. So use it with caution.\n\n-   Fix a bug with TypeScript type parsing ([#&#8203;3574](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3574))\n\n    This release fixes a bug with esbuild's TypeScript parser where a conditional type containing a union type that ends with an infer type that ends with a constraint could fail to parse. This was caused by the \"don't parse a conditional type\" flag not getting passed through the union type parser. Here's an example of valid TypeScript code that previously failed to parse correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    type InferUnion<T> = T extends { a: infer U extends number } | infer U extends number ? U : never\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

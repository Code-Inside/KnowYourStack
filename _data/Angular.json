This commit defines a reproducible way of building Angular DevTools which is useful for reviewers and contributers.\r\n\r\nThe actual changes I made include:\r\n1. Moving local development content into `devtools/README` (deleting `devtools/DEVELOPING.md`) and explicitly stating the Node version as well as global Yarn install to be clear about the correct way to build the extension. This should make it easier for reviewers to understand and reproduce builds.\r\n2. Moving release instructions to a separate doc to reduce noise as well as making some minor clean ups there.\r\n    \r\nI briefly considered pointing reviewers at a new `devtools/docs/reviewers.md` doc, but decided against it because I want these instructions to be maintained in a single location where contributors and reviewers use the same content. This way any changes don't miss one of these sets of users. If reviewers have trouble with this format (dev builds isn't useful to reviewers and some content is repeated from other docs for contributors) then we can consider splitting out to a separate `reviewers.md` file. But until then, I'd like to try sharing this content and see how it works out in practice.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55406","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(devtools): update README to be more clear for extension reviewers\" (#55406)"},{"Id":"2251210441","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T17:30:03","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"55404","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: migrate forms to prettier formatting","State":"open","Body":"Migrate formatting to prettier for forms from clang-format\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55404","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: migrate forms to prettier formatting\" (#55404)"},{"Id":"2251199413","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T17:23:26","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55403","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Do not duplicate change detection with run coalescing (part 2)","State":"open","Body":"This commit prevents doubling change detections when the zoneless scheduler is notified first, followed by the zone becoming unstable (effectively \"scheduling\" zone-based change detection).

This is problematic because it's not documented and does not produce any notification or error message when async work is done inside the hooks that requires change detection.

The application builder can now be accessed when this package is installed directly via `@angular/build:application`.\r\n\r\nNo changes are required for existing projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27485","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/build): introduce new official build system package\" (#27485)"},{"Id":"2250775357","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T14:40:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27496","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add support for the `poll` option in  the library builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for polling when using the ng-packagr builder\r\n\r\nCloses #27420\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27496","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add support for the `poll` option in  the library builder\" (#27496)"},{"Id":"2250141147","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T13:09:25","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27493","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove v17 migrations","State":"closed","Body":"This commit removes of migrations introduced in version 17\r\n\r\nCloses #26568, closes #27463\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27493","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove v17 migrations\" (#27493)"},{"Id":"2248103917","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T12:34:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27486","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support native async/await when app is zoneless","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis commit updates the esbuild based builders to emit native async/await when `zone.js` is not added as a polyfill.\r\n\r\nCloses #22191\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27486","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support native async/await when app is zoneless\" (#27486)"},{"Id":"2249760430","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T09:58:16","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27492","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.25.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.25.0` -> `v3.25.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.25.1`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.25.0...v3.25.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.25.0...v3.25.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-next.4...18.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   The deprecated `isPlatformWorkerUi` and `isPlatformWorkerApp` have been removed without replacement, as they serve no purpose since the removal of the WebWorker platform.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Angular only supports writable expressions inside of two-way bindings.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular will ensure change detection runs, even when the state update originates from\n    outside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\n    detection compared to the previous behavior.\n\n    This change will be more likely to impact existing unit tests.\n    This should usually be seen as more correct and the test should be updated,\n    but in cases where it is too much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the `TestBed` providers.\n\n    Similarly, applications which may want to update state outside the zone\n    and *not* trigger change detection can add\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the providers in `bootstrapApplication` or add\n    `schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly` to the\n    `BootstrapOptions` of `bootstrapModule`.\n-   Testability methods `increasePendingRequestCount`,\n    `decreasePendingRequestCount` and `getPendingRequestCount` have been\n    removed. This information is tracked with zones.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [3b0de30b37](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3b0de30b37f558d4815ca9a61db1010aaf3df068) | refactor | remove deprecated `isPlatformWorkerApp` and `isPlatformWorkerUi` API ([#&#8203;55302](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55302)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7d5bc1c628](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7d5bc1c62870d9c68e06eddec229a9b8988e92ee) | fix | remove container index from conditional instruction ([#&#8203;55190](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55190)) |\n| [4eb0165750](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4eb0165750d8c65812502343a70ef4cc35c725b9) | fix | remove support for unassignable expressions in two-way bindings ([#&#8203;55342](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55342)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fdd560ea14](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fdd560ea14f2f35608e26102c7fac0471a634b3e) | feat | Add ability to configure zone change detection to use zoneless scheduler ([#&#8203;55252](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55252)) |\n| [bce5e2344f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bce5e2344f312dc3a8a30d54e412958bd07180c1) | feat | Add build target for jsaction contract binary.

However, I've noticed a significant impact on performance metrics, particularly First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), when using the new version.\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, I found that Angular now splits all JavaScript code into chunks and adds a ```<link rel=\"modulepreload\">``` for each chunk in the ```<head>``` of the page. Although the scripts are loaded asynchronously with [@defer](https://angular.io/api/core/defer) method, the preloaded scripts seem to be affecting the rendering of critical content, delaying FCP and LCP.\r\n\r\nI've conducted tests using Lighthouse, and the results show that removing the modulepreload links improves FCP and LCP metrics. This issue seems to be similar to what was reported in these GitHub discussions:\r\n\r\n[GoogleChrome/lighthouse#11960](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/11960#issuecomment-779049941)\r\n[vitejs/vite#5991](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/5991#issuecomment-1088711936)\r\nIn both discussions, users reported improvements in FCP and LCP metrics after disabling or reducing the number of modulepreload links.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a way to selectively disable modulepreload links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 based on specific use cases. Therefore, I would like to seek clarification and guidance on how to address this issue to improve performance.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\nUpgrade an Angular application to version 18.0.0-next.4.\r\nEnable SSR and use esbuild.\r\nAnalyze performance metrics using Lighthouse with and without the modulepreload links.\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nI expect to see improved FCP and LCP metrics when excessive modulepreload links are removed or selectively disabled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nI have attached screenshots of the Lighthouse test results, showing the impact of modulepreload links on performance metrics.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1 - Lighthouse Test with modulepreload links\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132612](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/95b5a3ac-ac96-43a5-90f3-f538f900ec19)\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2 - Lighthouse Test without modulepreload links\r\nPerformed by removing all modulepreload links server side: \r\n```typescript\r\n        html = html.replace(\r\n          /<link .?rel=\"modulepreload\" .*?href=\"(?<href>.+?\\.js)\".*?>/g,\r\n          ''\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132254](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/0719109b-e98c-409b-9028-a72c4add7210)\r\n\r\nYour assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.0-next.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0-next.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... google-maps, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1800.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        17.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular/ssr                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular               18.0.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                              7.8.1\r\ntypescript                        5.4.5\r\nzone.js                           0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Excessive modulepreload Links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 Affecting Performance Metrics\" (#27490)"},{"Id":"2244822389","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-17T08:23:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27472","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: move builder testing infrastructure to separate bazel target module","State":"closed","Body":"The builder testing infrastructure and harness has been moved out of the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` package and into a separate bazel only module.

After a crash, the web inspector reveals nothing unusual, nor is there any console output.

So I want to pass an object full of subjects (searching$, **sorting$**, paging$, etc.) to the TableComponent and make it react to sort events on its own like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\" #tableWrapper (scroll)=\"onScroll()\">\r\n  <mat-table [dataSource]=\"data!\" class=\"table\" matSort (matSortChange)=\"onSort($event)\">\r\n    <mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"columns\"></mat-header-row>\r\n    <mat-row *matRowDef=\"let row; columns: columns\"></mat-row>\r\n    <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n  </mat-table>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I don't add matSort to the host component, I'll get `MatSortHeader must be placed within a parent element with the MatSort directive` error. And if I do, it'll seem to ignore the matSort set in the TableComponent.\r\n\r\nHere's a working example on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-4ja9sf).

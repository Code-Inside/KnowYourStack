In addition, as pointed out in issue #25791, I had to edit the `main.c36c93e7c9c8f569.js` file to change the path to the resources in the assets file to be consistent with that generated by the build.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Angular 17, I am no longer able to build the file such that it runs locally without modification of the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular 17 project\r\nrun \r\n`ng build --base-href HubView --omit-dev`\r\nand edit the index.html file as instructed above. \r\nClick on the generated file - it will not run\r\n\r\nIf I modify the angular.json file as follows\r\n```\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"outputPath\": \"dist/hub-view-v5-17\",\r\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\r\n            \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n```\r\nthe above technique works.

To do so requires adding a package using a variety of different version specifiers. Some of which a package manager may consider incompatible with the hosting project. However, this is not relevant to the selection logic of the `ng add` command which should select the version as designed. To verify it does so within the Angular CLI, the installed version needs to be checked.

previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n16.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe first time I run `ng test` I get several errors related to invalid paths where `$fa-font-path` seems to be resolved incorrectly as `../node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts/fa-brands-400.ttf` whereas the actual path is `../node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts/fa-brands-400.ttf`.\r\n\r\nThe error does not occur when running `ng test` a second time. The app itself runs fine with `ng serve` with styles and icons being displayed correctly. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this is an error with Angular or somewhere in the chain of Karma, sass, post-css, fontawesome etc.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project `ng new` with scss\r\n2. Add karma configs `ng generate config karma`\r\n3. Install FontAwesome `npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`\r\n4. Import fontawesome scss files in `styles.scss`\r\n```scss\r\n$fa-font-path: '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts';\r\n@import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/fontawesome.scss';\r\n@import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/brands.scss';\r\n```\r\n5.

It loads all of the JavaScript up-front, even if there are no maps on the page.\r\n2. It requires the user to ensure that the API is fully loaded before the `<google-map>` component starts rendering. Lazy-loading in this scenario is error-prone and loading the API up-front leads to a lot of unused JavaScript being loaded.\r\n\r\nThese changes add support for the [Dynamic Library Import API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#dynamic-library-import) which requires a tiny script to be added up-front which then allows the `<google-map>` to load the chunks of the API it needs on-demand. The legacy API is still supported, but is no longer recommended.\r\n\r\nAll the components also now have `initialized` outputs to make it easier to know when the underlying Maps classes have been created and can be interacted with.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28307","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(google-maps): add support for dynamic library loading API\" (#28307)"},{"Id":"2048107675","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-19T07:48:18","Actor":"DhanyaGopinathTR","Number":"28306","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(menuitem - accessibility): Role menuitem is not announced by screen readers","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEven though the menuitem role is added by default to the mat-menu-item, this is not reading by the screen readers like NVDA.\r\n\r\nFor eg:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mat-menu-in-angular-material/\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/86048403/ef861c4c-197e-480e-8538-485f3774458d)\r\n\r\n\r\n![example-mat-menu-item](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/86048403/9b55bc70-03be-4fdd-b247-a7925c967e1d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Currently this is not part of the [`MatDialogConfig`](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api#MatDialogConfig), so it cannot be set via the `MAT_DIALOG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` injection token. It can only be achieved by setting the `align` input for each usage of the [`mat-dialog-actions`](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api#MatDialogActions) component:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-dialog-actions align=\"end\">\r\n</mat-dialog-actions>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add an optional `alignActions` property to the `MatDialogConfig` interface to control the default alignment.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nThe actions alignment should be changeable at a single point for the whole application, so it is easier to maintain in larger code bases.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28302","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(dialog): set default actions alignment with injection token\" (#28302)"},{"Id":"2045624198","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T02:53:57","Actor":"albahrawy","Number":"28300","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(SnackBar): set value in afterDismissed did not update the view","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen subscribed to snackBarRef.afterDismissed() and set any value did not update the view till the next change cycle. \r\nI tried with normal variables and signal and in zone\n\n### Reproduction\n\nyou can check it here: [StackBlitz link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/kdplkt?file=src%2Fexample%2Fsnack-bar-overview-example.html,src%2Fexample%2Fsnack-bar-overview-example.ts)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

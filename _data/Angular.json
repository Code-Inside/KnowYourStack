For example, a build contains `main-[hash-1].js`, `chunk-[hash-2].js`, etc. where `[hash-*]` is the same for each corresponding file/chunk in its language version (e.g., `en` and `fr` versions). \n\nHowever, when I build the application for each language separately by setting the option `\"localize\": [\"en\"]`, and `\"localize\": [\"fr\"]` respectively, the hashes are completely different for each language. So for example, the `en` version has `main-[hash].js` and the `fr` version has `main-[another-hash].js`.\n\nThe latter behavior is what I would expect since some of these files have `i18n` or `$localize` resources in them, which is obviously different for each language version and therefore should produce a different hash to avoid mixing up the languages. Unless the same hash for all language versions is intentional?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nExample of a build with `\"localize\": true`:\n\n```true\ndist/app\n├── en\n│   ├── ...\n│   ├── main-H3SZZDKR.js\n│   └── polyfills-7ZWCGIBC.js\n└── fr\n    ├── ...\n    ├── main-H3SZZDKR.js\n    └── polyfills-7ZWCGIBC.js\n```\n\nExample where each language is build separately:\n\n```true\ndist/app\n├── en\n│   ├── ...\n│   ├── main-CQE7KPCM.js\n│   └── polyfills-BJCGKTZW.js\n└── fr\n    ├── ...\n    ├── main-HQXCGV5U.js\n    └── polyfills-ZM7SMIHU.js\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.3.11\nNode: 22.14.0 (Unsupported)\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 17.3.12\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.11\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\n@angular/cli                    17.3.11\n@angular/fire                   17.1.0\n@angular/material               17.3.10\n@schematics/angular             17.3.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60083","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cache-busting hash is same for all languages when `localize` option is `true`\" (#60083)"},{"Id":"2875728543","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T17:45:08","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60084","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): inline `depPath` in `throwCyclicDependencyError` to be dropped","State":"open","Body":"Inlines the `depPath` within the `throwCyclicDependencyError`, because it's not being tree-shaken in production.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc31ef4f-6d70-48cc-9b66-717543f195cb)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60084","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): inline `depPath` in `throwCyclicDependencyError` to be dropped\" (#60084)"},{"Id":"2875700665","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T17:32:09","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60082","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): drop `getNgModuleDef` error message in production","State":"open","Body":"Drops `getNgModuleDef` error message in production and replaces it with an error code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60082","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): drop `getNgModuleDef` error message in production\" (#60082)"},{"Id":"2875687087","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T17:25:49","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60081","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): tree-shake `REF_EXTRACTOR_REGEXP`","State":"open","Body":"The `REF_EXTRACTOR_REGEXP` is a `new` expression that has side effects and is not dropped in production, even if it is unused.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60081","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): tree-shake `REF_EXTRACTOR_REGEXP`\" (#60081)"},{"Id":"2873020914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T16:56:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"60067","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): capture stack for HMR errors","State":"closed","Body":"Currently we send the `message` of an error thrown during HMR.

This is very confusing and took me hours to figure out, as you cannot access the `REQUEST` or `REQUEST_CONTEXT` on SSG routes and there's no documentation of this.\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29691\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nClearly state that in order to access `REQUEST` and `REQUEST_CONTEXT`, your route must have a ServerRoute defined using the `renderMode: RenderMode.Server` defined in your Server Routing. Also mention you can ensure all your routes are ran through SSR (not SSG) by using the following in your app.config.server.ts file:\n\n```\nprovideServerRouting([\n   {\n      path: '**',\n      renderMode: RenderMode.Server,\n   }\n])\n````\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nMy app requires that I have access to the `REQUEST` object in order to get context about what host I'm rendering on. Without access to this, my app is dead in the water. Since all routes are rendered as SSG by default, you must provide server routing in your app.config.server.ts in order to state that all or some routes must be ran through SSR (render mode 'ssr') in order for you to be able to access the `REQUEST` and `REQUEST_CONTEXT` tokens.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI'd love for the documentation to clearly state this so that others don't end up like me wasting tons of hours only to find it in a github issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28714\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\nWithout server routes, `PlatformLocation` will not give you correct information either.

Technically we can already find this by looking through `TView.data`, but that'll require a linear lookup for each write which can get slow.\r\n\r\nThese changes introduce the new `TNode.directiveToIndex` map which allows us to quickly find the index of a directive based on its definition, as well as any host directives that its might've brought in.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): move component logic out of host directives resolution \r\nIn order to mark a TNode as a component, we need to store the index of the component definition. Currently this happens in the logic that resolves host directives, because the component's host directives can move affect the index.\r\n\r\nThese changes move the logic out into the directive initialization logic since it doesn't have much to do with host directives.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): avoid memory allocations if there are no host directives \r\n\r\nCurrently the host directive logic disassembles and re-assembles the array of directive matches, in case there are host directives which in most cases produces an identical array.\r\n\r\nThese changes add some logic so that we only need to allocate the additional memory if we actually need it.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add infrastructure for setting inputs on specific directives\r\nSets up the infrastructure that will allow to write only to a specific directive and its host directives as a base for future functionality.\r\n\r\nI've also renamed `setInputsForProperty` to be a bit more explicit that its sets all inputs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60075","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"More input writing refactors\" (#60075)"},{"Id":"2874631939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T11:20:53","Actor":"LanderBeeuwsaert","Number":"60074","RawContent":null,"Title":"this.scheduler.notify is not a function","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angularfire/issues/3618\nhttps://github.com/angular/angularfire/issues/3592\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59213\n\nI've been able to make a minimal reproduction:\nhttps://github.com/LanderBeeuwsaert/notify-scheduler-issue2\nrun with \"npm run t\"\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/LanderBeeuwsaert/notify-scheduler-issue2\nrun with \"npm run t\"\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"this.scheduler.notify is not a function\" (#60074)"},{"Id":"2874156199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T08:13:55","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"60073","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When placing debugger statements in our code the browser just points at the end of the component template. This is not a problem when AOT is enabled.\n\nI noticed after some debugging that disabling the Angular CLI cache resolves the problem. Running `ng cache clean` or removing the `.angular` directory and restarting the dev server (with caching) does not help. Caching needs to be completely disabled for sourcemaps to work.\n\n**Caching enabled:**\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df9a33b4-d0d1-4347-aa7e-7ad47a3ec0a2\" />\n\n\n**Caching disabled:**\n\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126bbea4-0318-4a96-95fa-c790d8a3df73\" />\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/urrang/ng19-sourcemap-repro\n\nCommand: `ng serve`\n\nThe repro app has a debugger statement in the button's click handler. On the main branch the problem should be reproducible. On the cache-disabled branch CLI's cache has been disabled and the debugger should work as expected.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.8\n@angular/cli                    19.1.8\n@schematics/angular             19.1.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29697","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing component sourcemaps with JIT and CLI cache enabled\" (#29697)"},{"Id":"2865169137","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-23T19:35:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29681","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://redirect.github.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c2612d3` -> `8d8e561` |\n| [@angular/bazel](https://redirect.github.com/angular/bazel-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `58e1a34` -> `a196e6b` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c2ee559` -> `c4374b7` |\n| [@angular/common](https://redirect.github.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `0184f3a` -> `65cb2d1` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ae58cb3` -> `e075d3e` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `128ae9c` -> `e64d4c7` |\n| [@angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `914ec51` -> `f6e802e` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://redirect.github.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fc0a025` -> `feef537` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://redirect.github.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e170311` -> `edcbb95` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://redirect.github.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e975a08` -> `e2fe6c6` |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b8a26ec` -> `a16ba53` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `81bf621` -> `69f5b1e` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `252589f` -> `260ddc4` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c51d68f` -> `6a83f11` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `e2ac515` -> `c39e0b5` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `0233766` -> `d5b9f6d` |\n| [@angular/router](https://redirect.github.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d9f99f5` -> `53fab48` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://redirect.github.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a55ae56` -> `0363a41` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `0ad6a37` -> `0000d92` |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

It works fine when built for production, however. \n\nHere's my `server.ts` file:\n\n```\nimport { AngularNodeAppEngine, createNodeRequestHandler, isMainModule, writeResponseToNodeResponse } from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport { RedirectError } from './app/core/errors/redirect.error';\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\n\napp.use(\n\texpress.static(browserDistFolder, {\n\t\tmaxAge: '1y',\n\t\tindex: false,\n\t\tredirect: false,\n\t})\n);\n\napp.use('/**', (req, res, next) => {\n\tangularApp\n\t\t.handle(req)\n\t\t.then((response) => (response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next()))\n\t\t.catch((err) => next(err));\n});\n\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n\tconst port = process.env['PORT'] || 8080;\n\tapp.listen(port, () => {\n\t\tconsole.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n\t});\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n```\n\nAfter reading #28995 I found out locally the server will do a \"route extraction\" causing it to run the application twice, but on both of these, I'm getting `null` when calling `inject(REQUEST)` during a `provideAppInitializer` call.\n\n```\n// My initializer function\nexport function initializeData() {\n   const request = inject(REQUEST);\n   console.warn('REQUEST is null:', request === null);\n\n   ... other code...\n}\n\n... in my app.config.ts...\nproviders: [\n   provideAppInitializer(intializeData),\n],\n```\n\nThis then logs the following on the local dev server:\n```\n// LOGS\n\nstore  | REQUEST is null: true\nstore  | REQUEST is null: true\n```\n\nAny ideas on what I can look for. I did the upgrade through `ng update` and the migration went smoothly with no issues.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angularssrlesson-fe2guyge?file=server.ts\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.5.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1901.8\n@angular-devkit/core         19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.1.8\n@angular/build               19.1.8\n@angular/cdk                 19.1.5\n@angular/cli                 19.1.8\n@angular/ssr                 19.1.8\n@schematics/angular          19.1.8\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.7.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI've also noticed that `inject(PlatformLocation).search` is empty when my URL always contains query parameters.

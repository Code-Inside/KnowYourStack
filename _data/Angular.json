This issue specifically arises when using nested form groups with `formGroupName`.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Create an Angular component with a form using reactive forms.\n2. Import `ReactiveFormsModule` before `FormsModule` in the component.\n3. Define a nested form structure using `formGroupName` and `formControlName`.\n4. Attempt to bind the nested form group and control in the template.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe form should initialize without errors, and nested form controls should be accessible and functional.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nAn error is thrown: \"formControlName must be used with a parent formGroup directive.\" This error occurs due to the import order of `ReactiveFormsModule` and `FormsModule` when using nested form groups.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- The issue is specific to the import order and the use of nested form groups.\n- Reversing the import order (importing `FormsModule` before `ReactiveFormsModule`) resolves the issue.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, inject } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from \"@angular/forms\";\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-form',\n    standalone: true,\n    imports: [\n        ReactiveFormsModule,\n        FormsModule,\n    ],\n    template: `\n        <form [formGroup]=\"formGroup\">\n            <form formGroupName=\"fg\">\n                <input formControlName=\"i\">\n            </form>\n        </form>\n    `\n})\nexport default class FormComponent {\n    formBuilder = inject(FormBuilder);\n\n    formGroup: FormGroup;\n\n    constructor() {\n        this.formGroup = this.formBuilder.group({\n            fg: this.formBuilder.group({\n                i: ''\n            })\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 15.2.11\nNode: 20.15.1 (Unsupported)\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.5.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 15.2.10\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.11 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.11\n@angular/cdk                    15.2.9\n@angular/cli                    15.2.11\n@schematics/angular             15.2.11\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58177","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"formControlName must be used with a parent formGroup directive' when importing ReactiveFormsModule before FormsModule\" (#58177)"},{"Id":"2582406556","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-12T01:54:54","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"58176","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): trim expression whitespace when `preserveSignificantWhitespace === false`","State":"open","Body":"This PR trims whitespace in expressions when `preserveSignificantWhitespace === false`. This allows messages to be a bit more durable to insignificant whitespace changes. For example, reformatting the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div i18n>Hello, {{ name }}!</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInto:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div i18n>Hello, {{\r\n  name\r\n}}!</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs a whitespace-only change which has no visible effect to translators. Therefore we trim whitespace before extracting messages and normalize it to a standard format (`{{name}}`).\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the functionality for ignoring placeholder expressions entirely (originally added as part of dab722f9c899d775bb886a1d5beb5970f79c4cd8). Ideally, we wouldn't take placeholders into account at all, since whether an expression is `{{foo}}` or `{{bar}}` is also irrelevant to the translator. However doing so causes some challenges with TC, so we can't go that far just yet (see http://b/367255149#comment10). Therefore this PR rolls back that particular feature and replaces it with this one which trims expression whitespace instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58176","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): trim expression whitespace when `preserveSignificantWhitespace === false`\" (#58176)"},{"Id":"2582392320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-12T01:22:11","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"58175","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): Prepare the compiler to flip the default standalone value.

We added branching logic to our mixin to work around this, but while troubleshooting we noticed that `:not()` still does not scope inner selectors, leading to inconsistencies between the two otherwise very similar pseudo-classes.\n\nThis Stackblitz exhibits the [old behavior](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vnauyk-4tulmw?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdemo.component.ts) and this Stackblitz exhibits the [new behavior](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vnauyk-98uu1x?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdemo.component.ts).\n\nMy main concern is less about whether the change to `:is()` is appropriate and more about whether `:not()` is going to change at a later date, especially in a patch release which will result in another breaking change for my team.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vnauyk-98uu1x?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdemo.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nN/A\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.8\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.8\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.8\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.8\n@schematics/angular             18.2.8\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58153","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"View encapsulation no longer handles `:is()` and `:not()` consistently\" (#58153)"},{"Id":"2581080442","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T14:07:37","Actor":"devversion","Number":"58162","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: disable bazel-saucelabs job","State":"closed","Body":"Disables the `bazel-saucelabs` job in `main`, and re-uses the PR legacy saucelabs job to run on `main` instead (which is much more stable and reliable).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58162","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: disable bazel-saucelabs job\" (#58162)"},{"Id":"2581473882","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T14:06:56","Actor":"devversion","Number":"58168","RawContent":null,"Title":"Various improvements for queries migration","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58168","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Various improvements for queries migration\" (#58168)"},{"Id":"2581462624","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T14:01:12","Actor":"BenRacicot","Number":"58167","RawContent":null,"Title":"Components used with attribute selector are not recognized by the language service","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlanguage-service\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI've noticed for some time now that within VSC the language service is hit or miss on recognizing the bindings of components used with an attribute selector. \n\n- However, some use-case scenarios with the same setup are recognized. \n- **In all cases the application builds without error.**\n\nHere is my latest example\n```\n<li\n  lib-tag\n  [ngClass]=\"{ 'border-watermelon-6': match?.skills?.includes(tag?.id) }\"\n  [iconLeft]=\"match?.skills?.includes(tag?.id) ?

Guards and resolvers are blocking actions which is why your **deep child route holds up the entire rendering until its complete**.\n\nThe current state of things render Resolvers useless if you have something that may take a few seconds to load in a child component that has its own resolver.\n\n**Simple use case for this:**\n```\nYour Account Page\n    > Your Orders\n```\nI want 'Your Account' to display while orders are loading. Orders may take 5 seconds to load but the user should be able to see the rest of the information on the 'Your Account' page.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA child route with a resolver should NOT block a parent from rendering. Parents should be rendered as soon as they are resolved.\n\nAllow the router to work in a non-synchronous way and eagerly load what routes it can and their respective components. This can be a configurable option in order to avoid breaking solutions that depend on the current behavior.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Workarounds like using ngIf on the router have other undesirable side effects such as \"Expression Changed After Checked\".\n\nThank you.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58157","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router unnecessarily waits for child resolvers before building parent component\" (#58157)"},{"Id":"2580355536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T03:41:51","Actor":"HyperLife1119","Number":"58156","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(service-worker): corrected default values ​​for navigation URLs","State":"open","Body":"The default value described in the documentation is inconsistent with the actual default value.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

We can explore converting this to a hard error sometime in the future.\r\n\r\nNote that this change is not gated on any flag and is currently targeting `patch`. I think this is reasonable because placeholder-only messages are useless to extract, but it is an observable behavior change. If we think that's too risky, I can put it behind a flag or target `major`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58154","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): ignore placeholder-only i18n messages\" (#58154)"},{"Id":"2579152506","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-10T15:56:14","Actor":"aguskov1987","Number":"58151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to resolve dependency tree during NPM install","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nTHIS ERROR HAPPENS WHEN INSTALLING DEPS FOR THE ACTUAL ANGULAR FRAMEWORK, NOT ANGULAR APPLICATION\nWhen installing the npm dependencies for the latest main branch (19.0.0-next-8) I encounter the following error:\n\nnpm error code ERESOLVE\nnpm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree\nnpm error\nnpm error While resolving: angular-srcs@19.0.0-next.8\nnpm error Found: @angular/core@19.0.0-next.5\nnpm error node_modules/@angular/core\nnpm error   dev @angular/core@\"^19.0.0-next\" from the root project\nnpm error   peer @angular/core@\"^19.0.0-0 || ^19.1.0-0 || ^19.2.0-0 || ^19.3.0-0 || ^20.0.0-0\" from @angular/material@19.0.0-next.4\nnpm error   node_modules/@angular/material\nnpm error     @angular/material@\"19.0.0-next.4\" from the root project\nnpm error   2 more (@angular/animations, @angular/cdk)\nnpm error\nnpm error Could not resolve dependency:\nnpm error peer @angular/core@\"19.0.0-next.9\" from @angular/common@19.0.0-next.9\nnpm error node_modules/@angular/common\nnpm error   peer @angular/common@\"^19.0.0-0 || ^19.1.0-0 || ^19.2.0-0 || ^19.3.0-0 || ^20.0.0-0\" from @angular/material@19.0.0-next.4\nnpm error   node_modules/@angular/material\nnpm error     @angular/material@\"19.0.0-next.4\" from the root project\nnpm error   peer @angular/common@\"^19.0.0-0 || ^19.1.0-0 || ^19.2.0-0 || ^19.3.0-0 || ^20.0.0-0\" from @angular/cdk@19.0.0-next.4\nnpm error   node_modules/@angular/cdk\nnpm error     @angular/cdk@\"19.0.0-next.4\" from the root project\nnpm error     1 more (@angular/material)\nnpm error\nnpm error Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry\nnpm error this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps\nnpm error to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.\nnpm error\nnpm error\nnpm error For a full report see:\nnpm error ---\nnpm verbose cwd ---\nnpm verbose os Windows_NT 10.0.22631\nnpm verbose node v20.18.0\nnpm verbose npm  v10.8.2\nnpm verbose exit 1\nnpm verbose code 1\nnpm error A complete log of this run can be found in: ---\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.8\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular:\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.8 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.8 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.2.8 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          18.2.8 (cli-only)\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58151","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to resolve dependency tree during NPM install\" (#58151)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2583557970","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-13T01:24:22","Actor":"MrJithil","Number":"28623","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(@schematics/angular): update code scaffolding doc to with `ng generate --help`","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\nImprove the Code scaffolding section.\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

`selector.unify()` and `@extend` combine selectors:\n\n    -   The relative order of pseudo-classes (like `:hover`) and pseudo-elements\n        (like `::before`) within each original selector is now preserved when\n        they're combined.\n\n    -   Pseudo selectors are now consistently placed at the end of the combined\n        selector, regardless of which selector they came from. Previously, this\n        reordering only applied to pseudo-selectors in the second selector.\n\n-   Tweak the color transformation matrices for OKLab and OKLCH to match the\n    newer, more accurate values in the CSS spec.\n\n-   Fix a slight inaccuracy case when converting to `srgb-linear` and\n    `display-p3`.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** `math.unit()` now wraps multiple denominator\n    units in parentheses. For example, `px/(em*em)` instead of `px/em*em`.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Use `@parcel/watcher` to watch the filesystem when running from JavaScript and\n    not using `--poll`. This should mitigate more frequent failures users have\n    been seeing since version 4.0.0 of Chokidar, our previous watching tool, was\n    released.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix `SassColor.interpolate()` to allow an undefined `options` parameter, as\n    the types indicate.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Properly pass missing color channel values to and from custom functions.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

More specifically, we want to use this to create harnesses for web components, some of which will then end up being used in Angular applications.\nWe've created our own implementation of these types and we're trying to make these compatible with Angular types so that the web component library can use the non-Angular version but these harnesses can then still be used in Angular ComponentHarnesses.\n\nWe've nearly gotten to the point where everything works, there's only one thing we cannot resolve: the `HarnessQuery` used in the `LocatorFactory` interface's functions references the `HarnessPredicate` class which has private properties.\nThis makes \"our\" version of HarnessQuery and the Angular version inherently incompatible according to typescript.\n\nThis could be a small change, e.g. limiting the type in `HarnessQuery` to only the required properties:\n\n```diff\n export type HarnessQuery<T extends ComponentHarness> =\n   | ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>\n-  | HarnessPredicate<T>;\n+  | Pick<HarnessPredicate<T>, 'getDescription' | 'getSelector' | 'harnessType'>\n```\n\nand in the `harness-environment.ts` file use a new function instead of `query instanceof HarnessPredicate`\n\n```ts\nfunction isHarnessPredicate<T extends ComponentHarness>(value: HarnessQuery<T>): value is Pick<HarnessPredicate<T>, 'getDescription' | 'getSelector' | 'harnessType'> {\n  return 'harnessType' in value;\n}\n```\n\n### Use Case\n\nAs mentioned above, we want to use the component harness concept in a non-Angular context and we want those harnesses to be compatible with harnesses written using the CDK and the CDK's harness environments.\n\nAn alternative solution could be to extract part of `@angular/cdk/testing` into a separate package that doesn't have any dependencies to the Angular framework.

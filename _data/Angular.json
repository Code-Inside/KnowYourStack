In Ivy, it no longer picks up the children with or without an `ngProjectAs`. Given `<ng-content select=*>` does work with `ngProjectAs`, it seems to me that `ContentChildren` should as well.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/henry-alakazhang/angular-content-children-repro\r\nMaster branch is v9, v8 branch is v8.\r\nhttps://github.com/henry-alakazhang/angular-content-children-repro/tree/v8\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@angular/localize                 9.0.0-rc.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.8\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nRelated to #34289, but the suggested solution (`descendants: true`) is not always feasible.

As a new Angular developer, it's very confusing to do one tutorial, only to discover another one. In addition, the Tour of Heroes tutorial states in the introduction: \"You don't have to do this, but Tour of Heroes is all through the rest of the docs, so you should probably read about it anyway.\" (I'm paraphrasing, of course. :) )\r\n\r\nWe should consolidate our getting started tutorials from two to one. In addition, we should make them IDE independent, so the user can choose if they want to use StackBlitz, VS Code, or any other environment. \r\n\r\nMy initial recommendation is that we should revamp Tour of Heroes, unless there is statistical evidence that suggests the Phone App tutorial is better received by the community.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34766","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidate tutorials and make them IDE independent.\" (#34766)"},{"Id":"549224159","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-13T22:41:05","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"34765","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: add a sauce-service.sh script that manages the sauce-connect as a service","State":"open","Body":"The following scripts now use the new ./scripts/saucelabs/sauce-service.sh script:\r\n- ./scripts/saucelabs/start-tunnel.sh\r\n- ./scripts/saucelabs/stop-tunnel.sh\r\n- ./scripts/saucelabs/wait-for-tunnel.sh\r\n- ./scripts/saucelabs/start-and-wait-for-tunnel.sh\r\n\r\n./scripts/saucelabs/start-tunnel.sh no longer needs to be called as a background process as it starts up the service & returns.\r\n\r\nBazel sh_binary targets target to run these added and utilized in CircleCI config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"sauce_service_start\",\r\n    srcs = [\"scripts/saucelabs/start-tunnel.sh\"],\r\n    data = [\r\n        \"scripts/saucelabs/sauce-service.sh\",\r\n        \"@npm//:node_modules/sauce-connect/bin/sc\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"sauce_service_start_ready_wait\",\r\n    srcs = [\"scripts/saucelabs/start-and-wait-for-tunnel.sh\"],\r\n    data = [\r\n        \"scripts/saucelabs/sauce-service.sh\",\r\n        \"@npm//:node_modules/sauce-connect/bin/sc\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"sauce_service_ready_wait\",\r\n    srcs = [\"scripts/saucelabs/wait-for-tunnel.sh\"],\r\n    data = [\r\n        \"scripts/saucelabs/sauce-service.sh\",\r\n        \"@npm//:node_modules/sauce-connect/bin/sc\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"sauce_service_stop\",\r\n    srcs = [\"scripts/saucelabs/stop-tunnel.sh\"],\r\n    data = [\r\n        \"scripts/saucelabs/sauce-service.sh\",\r\n        \"@npm//:node_modules/sauce-connect/bin/sc\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-factor for having Bazel karma pre-test call `//:sauce_service_start_ready_wait` and post_test call `//:sauce_service_stop`.\r\n\r\nSince each test needs to start & stop the service, the service script keeps a count of start & stop requests so and only kills the service after count goes to 0.

It does not contain any further members of the class.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial should explain this in more detail, and if there is any best practices on how to transform from the JSON object to a real typed object, this should also be explained or pointed to.\r\n\r\nThe functionality/feature that a plain JSON object is returned despite of the type being specified is for example discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20770\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6#httpclientget-returns-response-data\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34746","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tour of Heroes (toh-pt6): Misleading information on HTTP request response type\" (#34746)"},{"Id":"548516606","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-12T11:19:52","Actor":"Nephera","Number":"34744","RawContent":null,"Title":"Meta Class not adding Meta lines to DOM timely enough for Discord Link-type Embed","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\n\r\nI believe the issue lies in @angular/platform-browser, but I'm not sure that anything can be done.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\nI've never been able to get this to work.  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nDiscord supports Open Graph to display rich embed for links.  The 4 properties that it works with are: og:title, og:site_name, og:description, and og:image.  I've not been able to successfully use Meta.addTag(...) or Meta.addTags(...) to get these properties to add to the DOM in a timely enough manner for the Discord crawler -- which they use to gather the rich embed meta data -- to catch said data.  The only way I've been able to get it to catch the meta data is when it's hard-coded into index.html; and I'd rather not do that, as I'd like it to be possible to display rich embed data in Discord that changes based on the state of the application for a better user experience.  Maybe this issue isn't with Angular as much as it's a problem with the Discord crawler bot, but I don't see the Discord team being willing to make changes to their bot to account for Angular applications.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nhttps://angular-issue-repro2-g7yj9k.stackblitz.io\r\n\r\nThough pasting this link into discord doesn't display any metadata; if I were to host it on my personal web server, all I would see is \"SITE NAME\", as it's hard coded into index.html\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.21\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/core         8.3.21\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   8.3.21\r\n@schematics/angular          8.3.21\r\n@schematics/update           0.803.21\r\nrxjs                         6.4.0\r\n\r\nBut the project is on 7.3.9, as we have some issues with forms that are not Angular 8 ready.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

compiler\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nSome ES6 imports in a library causes a compile error when a project using the library is compiled with Ivy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI have a project structure with an app (`my-app`) depending on an (private) npm-deployed Angular library (`map-ui-lib`), which in turn has a peer dependency to OpenLayers, which is a pure ES6 project with typings in DefinitelyTyped.\r\n\r\n`map-ui-lib` uses deep imports like `import { WMTS } from 'ol/source';` from OpenLayers.\r\n\r\nIf `map-ui-lib` is compiled with `--prod` to disable Ivy, as recommended for libraries by https://next.angular.io/guide/ivy#maintaining-library-compatibility, attempting to use the library in `my-app` results in \r\n\r\n    ERROR in The target entry-point \"map-ui-lib\" has missing dependencies:\r\n     - ol/source\r\n\r\nIf I disable Ivy in `my-app`, the application compiles and works.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly, if I compile `map-ui-lib` with Ivy and deploy (as a file reference to a tarball, to circumvent the prohibition on publishing Ivy-based libraries), and compile `my-app` with Ivy, it works.\r\n\r\n(Compiling `my-app` with Ivy disabled while attempting to use the Ivy-based library unsurprisingly yields a factory error).\r\n\r\nIn short: A library using deep ES6 imports compiled as non-Ivy fails when used in an Ivy project, and Ivy-based libraries are explicitly prohibited.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ERROR in The target entry-point \"map-ui-lib\" has missing dependencies:\r\n -

DEV vs PROD environment) requires a rebuild of the application.\r\n\r\nThis is IMHO not acceptable, since it prevents me to reuse the same artifacts when promoting a build across DTAP environments, and impacts the portability of an application.\r\n\r\nWhile I could figure out an easy alternative for environment options and `baseHref`, with a bit of support from SSR and nginx, I couldn't work around the issues i found with `deployUrl`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be allowed to inject custom asset url resolver logic that allows to retrieve and consume the deployUrl at runtime, not only statically at buildtime. This should apply both to lazy-loaded modules and possibly to resources referenced in SASS files.\r\n\r\nPerhaps deriving the right URL of the CDN by using the value of a custom `<meta>` tag in the index.html could be a very convenient way to have it dinamically resolved by the webserver. In alternative, it should be possible to customize the provider responsible to retrieve such value at runtime, similarly to what we can do with https://angular.io/api/common/APP_BASE_HREF\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI tried a custom webpack builder and I had some success using `__webpack_public_path__` for lazy-loading of modules. This was not enough to correctly resolve references to external resources in scss files.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Avoiding app rebuild for a different deployUrl, dynamic deployUrl resolution at runtime\" (#16625)"},{"Id":"549130919","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T23:46:41","Actor":"vespertilian","Number":"16653","RawContent":null,"Title":"NG 8 IE 11 & Differential Loading","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/ ... not sure cli? it's a build issue\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSo there are a few things to track here: \r\n\r\nSpecifically in IE11\r\n\r\nIf I build the linked project with the `tsconfig.json` target \"es5\" everything works. (baseline).\r\n\r\nIf I build the project with `tsconfig.json` target \"es2015\" a few things do not work as I expect:\r\n\r\n1. It builds both es2015 and es5 bundles. Strangely IE11 will load both the es2015 and the es5 bundles, when I expected it to just load the es5 bundle. Chrome correctly loads just the es2015 bundle.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"ie11-loading-both-bundles\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72109101-39b63500-3389-11ea-9c5c-399d3902b68e.png\">\r\n\r\n2. The es5 bundle created when differential loading is enabled is larger than the es5 bundle created when ts.config is set to es5 and differential loading is off. In my small sample app the differences are not that large but in our production app the difference is substantial. I would have thought that the es5 differential loading bundle would be no bigger than the non differential loading use case. \r\n\r\nDifferential loading\r\n<img width=\"1407\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-app-diff-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72110982-a2071580-338d-11ea-8a23-970f84b0264c.png\">\r\n\r\nNo differential loading\r\n<img width=\"1351\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-no-d-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72202237-04a50200-34b1-11ea-9776-b8fc8d3f8af3.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the above images you can see that the main bundle for the base ES5 scenario is 282 but for the differential loading its 298. Again this is a small sample app, in our production app this is more pronounced.\r\n\r\n3. The bundle created produces errors when running in IE11, loading ESRI maps. Again I find this strange as I would have assumed the es5 differential loading bundle would be equivalent to the bundle created when setting ts.config to es5, which works fine.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"643\" alt=\"ie11-error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72111192-2c4f7980-338e-11ea-9586-b9897893d26a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vespertilian/ng8-ie11\r\n\r\nbuild with npm run build\r\nserve the dist build with ng run serve-dist (might need to install http-server)\r\n\r\nchange ts.config from es5 to es2015 to build the different packages. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust for the third case\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Object expected\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.22\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.21\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.22\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.22\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.21\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.22\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.22\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

No error is generated, but the template value is not set as expected.\r\n\r\nThis breaking change is covered in a recent [documentation update on angular.io](https://next.angular.io/guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#cannot-bind-to-value-property-of-select-with-ngfor). \r\n\r\nThe suggested solution is to change to the following template:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Native in MatFormField</mat-label>\r\n  <select matNativeControl>\r\n    <option>None</option>\r\n    <option [value]=\"option\" [selected]=\"matAndNativeSelected === option\" *ngFor=\"let option of matAndNativeOptions\">{{ option }}</option>\r\n  </select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n\r\n<p>You selected: {{matAndNativeSelected}}</p>\r\n\r\n<label>Native Select</label>&nbsp;\r\n<select>\r\n  <option>None</option>\r\n  <option [value]=\"option\" [selected]=\"nativeSelected === option\" *ngFor=\"let option of nativeOptions\">{{ option }}</option>\r\n</select>\r\n\r\n<p>You selected: {{nativeSelected}}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the non-native `<mat-select>` with `<mat-option>` elements, applying a similar pattern is not supported as there is no `selected` Input on [`MatOption`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/49a1324acc05cec1c5ff28d729abfe590f6772dd/src/material/core/option/option.ts#L87).\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Material Select</mat-label>\r\n  <mat-select>\r\n    <mat-option>None</mat-option>\r\n    <mat-option [value]=\"option\" [selected]=\"materialSelected === option\" *ngFor=\"let option of materialOptions\">{{ option }}</mat-option>\r\n  </mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n\r\n<p>You selected: {{materialSelected}}</p>\r\n```\r\n```html\r\nerror NG8002: Can't bind to 'selected' since it isn't a known property of 'mat-option'.\r\n1. If 'mat-option' is an Angular component and it has 'selected' input, then verify that it is part of this module.\r\n\r\n36     <mat-option [value]=\"option\" [selected]=\"materialSelected === option\" *ngFor=\"let option of materialOptions\">{{ option }}</mat-option>\r\n                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  src/components-examples/material/select/select-overview/select-overview-example.ts:8:16\r\n    8   templateUrl: 'select-overview-example.html',\r\n                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Error occurs in the template of component SelectOverviewExample.\r\n```\r\nIt's good that `<mat-select>` supports the View Engine `[value]` binding approach without any breaking change.\r\nHowever, it unfortunately does not support the new recommended style used by native `<select>`. This is a bit confusing and complicates moving back and forth between `<mat-select>` and `<select>` in `<mat-form-field>` elements.\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Material Select</mat-label>\r\n  <mat-select [value]=\"materialSelected\">\r\n    <mat-option>None</mat-option>\r\n    <mat-option [value]=\"option\" *ngFor=\"let option of materialOptions\">{{ option }}</mat-option>\r\n  </mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n\r\n<p>You selected: {{materialSelected}}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actions needed\r\n\r\n1. Update the MatSelect docs to demonstrate the proper way to do this to reduce confusion and issue reports\r\n1. Consider adding a `selected` Input to `MatOption`\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.0.0-rc.8\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n\r\nRelated issues\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34470\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34709","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18167","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"material/select(ivy): breaking changes in Ivy for binding order with ngFor and value binding\" (#18167)"},{"Id":"548339117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-13T23:29:39","Actor":"osuritz","Number":"18151","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/icon): New NoopIconModule for silencing unit test errors","State":"closed","Body":"Introducing the NoopIconModule to help silence Karma tests throwing warnings about custom icons not found.

But without using the `:host` selector around, every selector gets their component attribute for View Encapsulation.  \r\nInside `:host`, it does work as Angular's preparing ViewEncapsulation is ignoring everything before `:host`.\r\n\r\nThis should at least be documented, but I would prefer a way of handling in all cases. I'd say, it's bad practice to wrap everything in `:host`, which is a workaround currently.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the example in the current documentation doesn't work either (and the documentation is quite outdated, for which I'll add another issue).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Use `cdk-high-contrast` mixin outside of `:host` selector in Angular 9 Release Candidate\r\n2. See that its coding _is not_ applied in high contrast mode\r\n3. Use mixin within `:host` selector\r\n4.

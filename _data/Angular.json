occur: \"TypeError: Failed to construct 'Worker': This document requires 'TrustedScriptURL' assignment.\", as the emitted script code would attempt to instantiate the `Worker` using an `URL` instance rather than a `TrustedScriptUrl`.\n\nWhile working around the `TypeError` e.g. by employing the Angular `DomSanitizer` like this: `new Worker(this.#sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.RESOURCE_URL, this.#sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(new URL('<workerfile>', import.meta.url).toString())))`, might prevent the `TypeError`, it would also break the replacement of the worker url.\n\nIt

Developers are forced to avoid adding any js/ts file to the polyfills array. Instead, they have to create js scripts inline inside index.html, or write js files, and include them as assets with index.html\n\n---\n\nThe problem is within these lines:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/2c3a46b9ecf69049fbddb2c912636d9d62e197df/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/utils.ts#L469-L478\n\nThe presence of *any* js/ts file in the polyfills array causes zone to be included, even though I uninstalled zone.js and do everything zone-less-ly.\n\nI had a file called `polyfill-buffer.ts` which I used to add to the polyfill array:\n```ts\nimport { Buffer } from 'buffer';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nNow I have to add it to index.html as a script\n```js\nimport { Buffer } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buffer/+esm';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nThis is maintainable for small scripts like these. But it eliminates the possibility of using any file-based polyfill stuff.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"incorrect detection of zoneless app\" (#30689)"},{"Id":"3217321980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T23:27:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30688","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30688","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.0 release\" (#30688)"},{"Id":"3217280453","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T22:37:36","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30687","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30687","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.0\" with changelog.\" (#30687)"},{"Id":"3217045505","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T21:17:24","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30686","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update Angular versions for 20.1 stable","State":"closed","Body":"The package versions for Angular related packages have been adjusted to reflect the stable release of Angular 20.1.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30686","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update Angular versions for 20.1 stable\" (#30686)"},{"Id":"3216835654","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T18:50:40","Actor":"teoeter","Number":"30685","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add headless mode for vitest browser mode","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is not documented or clearly communicated, leading to a false sense of correctness.\n\n- Additionally, creating a project with a web worker generates a `tsconfig.worker.json`, which seems redundant because esbuild doesn't use it for type-checking. Also `builder` contains the `webWorkerTsConfig` option in the schema, as I understand it, this doesn't affect anything. This can confuse developers into thinking their web worker code is properly validated.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nEither esbuild-based builder should perform type checking on web worker files, or there should be clear documentation and/or warnings that type-checking is not performed on workers.\n\n**Current Behavior**\n\n- No build-time type checking for worker code.\n\n- Misleading tsconfig.worker.json is generated, giving false confidence in type safety.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new Angular project with esbuild (Angular CLI 18+).\n2. Add a web worker via ng generate web-worker.\n3. Introduce a type error in the worker file.\n4. Run ng build – no type error is reported.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAny version with esbuild bundler.\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30676","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Esbuild Web Worker Type Safety and Redundant tsconfig.worker.json\" (#30676)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3224454000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-11T23:21:35","Actor":"jordandoan","Number":"31529","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): on openedChange, the panel value is wrong","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.1.2\n\n### Description\n\nWhen triggering the event \"openedChange,\" the panel value is defined when the panel is closed (openedChange emits `false`) and the panel value is undefined when the panel is open (openedChange emits `true`).\n\nA current workaround is setting your logic based around the panel in a setTimeout function.

Popover","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nImplement a CDK component which utilizes the [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) to display popover content.\n\n(Presented as alternative to #28769)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThe [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) is fully supported on all major browsers (with the exception of the `hint` type), but Angular Material lacks a CDK Popover to serve as a baseline implementation of this API. The Popover API is not a 1:1 replacement for the `<dialog>` element, therefore it doesn't necessarily make sense to overhaul CDK Overlay using the Popover API, but a CDK Popover would present significant value - particularly for long-standing issue #2691.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31504","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(popover): Add CDK Popover\" (#31504)"},{"Id":"3215019996","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T08:31:34","Actor":"anisabboud","Number":"31503","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(tabs): Tab group with lazy loaded content (matTabContent) - weird/blinking/buggy animation in RTL","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n**LTR (smooth animation)**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a559be9e-3bbe-4b92-9aab-642fc9ef7590)\n\n**RTL (buggy animation)**: First -> Second -> Third\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d49e88-ec66-4a39-a39c-a3a443853230)\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.

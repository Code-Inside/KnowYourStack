Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nCurrently, when developers use enableProfiling() and record a performance profile in Chrome DevTools, Angular lifecycle hooks and other framework events appear in the Performance panel timeline under the \"🅰️ Angular\" custom track. However, when clicking on these events (e.g., AppComponent:ngOnInit, \"Change detection\", \"Bootstrap application\"), the details panel only shows basic information, such as timestamp and duration, without any contextual documentation or explanation of what these events represent.\r\nThis makes it difficult for developers to:\r\n\r\nUnderstand what each Angular-specific performance mark means\r\nLearn about lifecycle hooks that they're unfamiliar with\r\nGet guidance on performance optimization directly in DevTools\r\n\r\nDevelopers must manually search for Angular documentation to understand the events they're seeing in their performance profiles.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #63959\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat is the new behavior?\r\nAfter this change, when developers record a performance profile and click on Angular events in the Chrome DevTools Performance panel, they'll see clickable documentation links in the details panel that navigate directly to relevant Angular documentation.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nClicking on AppComponent:ngOnInit now shows a link to https://angular.dev/api/core/OnInit\r\nClicking on \"Change detection\" shows a link to the zone pollution best practices guide\r\nClicking on \"Bootstrap application\" shows a link to the bootstrapApplication API docs\r\n\r\nThe links appear in the details panel as:\r\njson{\r\n  \"links\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"url\": \"https://angular.dev/api/core/OnInit\",\r\n      \"title\": \"View documentation\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\nThis provides immediate, contextual access to Angular documentation directly from the performance profiling workflow, helping developers understand what they're seeing and how to optimize their applications without leaving DevTools.\r\nNote: This feature requires Chrome v141+ (currently available in Chrome Canary/Dev channels) and only works when profiling is enabled in development mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/65947","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Feature/performance panel\" (#65947)"},{"Id":"3712819330","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-09T22:08:16","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"65948","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): explicitly cast signal node value to String","State":"open","Body":"If the computed's `toString` is called and `node.value` is a Symbol, the browser will throw an exception `ERROR TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string`\r\n\r\nSymbols cannot be implicitly changed to strings.

I’m unsure where to put it.\n\nThe Angular update guide contains the step (emphasis mine)\n\n> Zone-based applications should add `provideZoneChangeDetection()` to your application's root providers. For standalone apps, add it to the `bootstrapApplication` call. For NgModule-based apps, add it to your root `AppModule`'s `providers` array. **An automated migration should handle this.**\n\nWhile the migration *does* update the main app, it leaves the tests alone, which in my case caused them to fail with an `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` that was very hard to find the root cause for.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/update-guide?v=20.0-21.0&l=1\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nIt would be nice if the migration could add the provider to the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` calls automatically.

Rather than following the robust steps, simply attempt focus.\n      //\n      // @see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#get-the-focusable-area\n      // @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLOrForeignElement/focus\n      // @see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area\n      elSelected.focus();\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nBecause smooth scrolling is asynchronous, Angular’s assumption that window scrolling completes synchronously no longer holds. The subsequent focus() call can interrupt the in-progress animation, resulting in an incorrect final scroll position (the viewport ends up offset incorrectly compared to the intended anchor position).\n\nThis behavior is partially addressed in Angular 20.1, which introduces an options parameter for all ViewportScroller methods so scroll behavior can be explicitly configured and overridden. However, when behavior: 'smooth' is used (or when smooth behavior is still desired), the same glitch occurs: the focus call competes with the in-progress smooth scroll.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/muffinman-coder/572c382e0bcc74afc6872fe605880c3c\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNone. No JavaScript exceptions or console errors are thrown.\n\nThe issue is a behavioral race condition between smooth scrolling and a subsequent focus() call. When smooth scrolling is enabled, the scroll is asynchronous; Angular assumes it is synchronous and immediately focuses the target element, which interrupts the in-progress scroll animation and results in an incorrect final scroll position.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n20.0.x\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn windows 11 to enable the smooth scrolling go to: Settings -> Ease of Use -> Show animations in windows","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65938","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ViewportScroller scrollToAnchor method + smooth scrolling + focus causes incorrect final scroll position when scroll-behavior: smooth is used\" (#65938)"},{"Id":"3709125264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-09T04:11:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"65937","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (main)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 5am and before 7am on Tuesday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The StackBlitz above compares the three form types (Template-driven, Reactive, Signal forms).\n2. The first two timepickers (Template-Driven & Reactive), turn red if you input an invalid value.\n3. The third timepicker (Signal form), doesn't turn red if you input an invalid value.\n4. In my project it also doesn't turn red when the field is clicked and blurred while empty, even though I've added a `required(fields.startTime);` to the signal form, and it's adding an asterisk to the form-field indicating that it's required. (For some reason this specific point isn't reproducing in the stackblitz above.)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect two things:\n- (a) When the field contains an invalid value like \"123\" or \"abc\", it should should have a red outline and the form should be \"invalid\".\n- (b) When the field is empty and it's clicked then blurred, and there's a `required(...)` validator, it should turn red.\n\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere is no basic validation for empty/invalid values when using signal forms `[field]` with `<mat-timepicker>`.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.0.3\n- CDK/Material: 21.0.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32497","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/timepicker): Usage with signal forms validation required & valid\" (#32497)"},{"Id":"3705334527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-08T08:54:33","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32496","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): combine style resets","State":"open","Body":"Prior to #31522 we had two places with style resets, because the user could either use a custom theme or one of the pre-built ones.

Optionally, if the combobox is editable and contains a string that does not match an allowed value, expansion does not occur.\n> - It is displayed when the combobox receives focus even if the combobox is editable and empty.\n> - If the combobox is editable, the popup is displayed only if a certain number of characters are typed in the combobox and those characters match some portion of one of the suggested values.\n\nI think the third example condition in particular is not captured well by the current design. I also think this is a common use case for things like editors with chips (e.g. like in the Github comment UI, when I type in a comment \"fix my issue @wagnermaciel 😛\" the popup triggers only when I type `@` and then again when I type `:`)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32493","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(aria/combobox): allow custom popup triggering logic\" (#32493)"},{"Id":"3698933508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T19:34:29","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32489","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/overlay): error when attempting to attach disposed overlay","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes an error that was being thrown when calling `attach` on an overlay that was disposed already.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32489","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/overlay): error when attempting to attach disposed overlay\" (#32489)"},{"Id":"3698227028","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T09:40:43","Actor":"ErsinCabuk","Number":"32486","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(Dialog): animate.leave","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWhen you use the if control flow or ViewContainerRef.createComponnt in Angular, animate.enter and animate.leave work.

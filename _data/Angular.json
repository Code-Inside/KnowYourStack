For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.28.0 - 20 Dec 2024\n\n-   Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.5. [#&#8203;2655](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2655)\n-   Don't fail in the unusual case that a file is on the search path.

Nevertheless, I wonder if there's really no way to mitigate the potential problems coming from it by throwing some sort of errors (at least at dev time). \n\nHere is a minimal example: \n```ts\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class Store {\n  private readonly state = signal({ value: 0 });\n\n  readonly counter = computed(() => this.state());\n  readonly frozenCounter = computed(() => Object.freeze(this.state()));\n\n  increase() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value + 1 }));\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value - 1 }));\n  }\n}\n\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <h3>App</h3>\n    <p>Computed: {{ value() }}</p>\n    <p>Store: {{ store.counter().value }}</p>\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {\n  protected readonly store = inject(Store);\n  protected readonly value = computed(() => this.store.counter().value);\n\n  increase() {\n    // this.store.increase(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value++; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value++; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    // this.store.decrease(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value--; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value--; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n}\n```\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bqez6f1y\n\nA service acting as a store is just a popular use case, but essentially any signal having an object is potentially affected by the same problem. In all such cases, exposing / passing `computeds` or `readonly` signals don't make 100% sure the state cannot be accidentally mutated. At least, I'm not aware of any \"ng-way\" to achieve it. \n\nSo I wonder: would be freezing / deepFreezing signals something the team has considered? For example as an opt-in in dev mode... [as recently done by ngrx-store team](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1). Alternatively, any other suggestion in userland to address the problem? \n\nI understand this might favour a more \"strictly immutable approach\" to the data flow... and in general, it might make the signal implementation more complicated. \n\nI hope I haven't missed anything trivial (in case sorry). \nThanks a lot! \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThat I'm aware of: \n- Opt-in freeze / deepFreeze for all signals (at least in dev mode) + runtime errors, \n- expose a `read` / `transform` / ... option for signal / computed and cherry-pick the cases to freeze: `const state = signal({ value: 0 }, {read: Object.freeze})` + runtime errors, \n- purely at ts level (likely impossible => breaking change + I'm for sure missing something else 😅): \n```ts\n// freeze case, deepFreeze likely more complicated (if DeepReadonly possible 😅)\ntype Readonly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };\n\ndeclare function computed<T>(computation: () => T, options?: CreateComputedOptions<T>): Signal<Readonly<T>>;\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(signal): better guardrails to avoid wrong signal object mutations\" (#59287)"},{"Id":"2754729306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:13:56","Actor":"jossephus","Number":"59286","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page","State":"open","Body":"simple PR :-)\r\nIt fixes missing code annotation in  routing-with-urlmatcher page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59286","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page\" (#59286)"},{"Id":"2754724132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:01:39","Actor":"Meehdi","Number":"59285","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix mermaid polygon node text visibility in dark mode","State":"open","Body":"Fix visibility issue with text inside polygon nodes in mermaid diagrams when using dark mode theme to ensure proper contrast and readability\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Though there are a couple of higher level libraries for the web, I want to stick to the rather proven stack using Envoy (which we're using in other apps anyway).\n\nI've started with https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/tree/master/net/grpc/gateway/examples/helloworld example client.

The Service Worker is registered in Angular `main.ts` like\n\n```ts\n if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker\n    .register('/grpc-service-worker.js')\n    .then((registration) => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n      navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((sw) => {\n        sw.active?.postMessage({ type: 'INIT', ready: true }); // Initial message to the service worker\n      });\n    })\n    .catch((error) => console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error));\n}\n```\n\nHere's the `public/grpc-service-worker.js`\n\n```js\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n  const { type, payload } = event.data;\n\n  console.log(\"NGSW\", type) // doesn't get printed on built asset or non-localhost addresses\n\n  switch (type) {\n    case 'cpu_utilization':\n      broadcastMessage('cpu_utilization', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'cpu_clock':\n      broadcastMessage('cpu_clock', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'hwmon':\n      broadcastMessage('hwmon', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'stream_error':\n      broadcastMessage('stream_error', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'stream_end':\n      broadcastMessage('stream_end');\n      break;\n  }\n});\n\n// Broadcast data to all clients (Angular app)\nfunction broadcastMessage(type, payload = null) {\n  self.clients.matchAll({ includeUncontrolled: true }).then((clients) => {\n    clients.forEach((client) => {\n      client.postMessage({ type, payload });\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIn dev mode service worker does execute `console.log(\"NGSW\", type)`, but not in built/non-localhost addresses.\n|                                            |                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| ![dev](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmoazzem/guardian/refs/heads/main/gui/public/grpc-web-dev-ngsw-log.png) | ![built](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmoazzem/guardian/refs/heads/main/gui/public/grpc-web-built-ng-dist-logs.png) |\n\nNotice the grpc-web-client prints received data length in both cases.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/hmoazzem/guardian/tree/main/gui\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nservice worker in Angular doesn't seem to get (and console.log) events in prod mode, or non-localhost addresses in dev mode\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.5\nNode: v22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm\nOS: Linux x64\n\npackage.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"gui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"watch\": \"ng build --watch --configuration development\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\"\n  },\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.0.3\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.0.3\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@electric-sql/pglite\": \"^0.2.15\",\n    \"ace-builds\": \"^1.37.0\",\n    \"echarts\": \"^5.5.1\",\n    \"grpc-web\": \"^1.5.0\",\n    \"ngx-echarts\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@grpc/grpc-js\": \"^1.12.4\",\n    \"@grpc/proto-loader\": \"^0.7.13\",\n    \"@types/google-protobuf\": \"^3.15.12\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"async\": \"^3.2.6\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.20\",\n    \"google-protobuf\": \"^3.21.4\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~2.1.0\",\n    \"lodash\": \"^4.17.21\",\n    \"ng-packagr\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.4.49\",\n    \"protoc-gen-js\": \"^3.21.4\",\n    \"protoc-gen-ts\": \"^0.8.7\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.17\",\n    \"ts-loader\": \"^9.5.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.6.2\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.97.1\",\n    \"webpack-cli\": \"^5.1.4\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59278","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"grpc-web works in dev mode and localhost only;

This is implemented as a regex which isn't aware of things like nested selectors. Normally this is fine for `:host`, because each `:host` produces one scoped selector which doesn't affect any child selectors, however it breaks down with `:host-context` which replaces each instance with two selectors. For example, if we have a selector in the form of `:host-context(.foo) a:not(.a, .b)`, the compiler ends up determining that `.a,` is the end selector and produces `.foo[a-host] a[contenta]:not(.a, .foo [a-host] a[contenta]:not(.a, .b) {}`.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by splitting the CSS alogn top-level commas, processing the `:host-context` in them individually, and stiching the CSS

However, when the same functionality is moved to an imported function in a separate file, the build fails with the error: **\"An error occurred while extracting routes.\"**\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**1. Create an API route directly in server.ts(works fine during build):**\n\n```\napp.get('/api/ping', (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  return res.json({\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    message: 'Ok'\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Refactor the response logic into a separate file, ping.controller.ts:**\n\n```\nexport default () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        uptime: process.uptime(),\n        message: 'Ok'\n      });\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**3. Import and use the ping.controller.ts function in server.ts(throws error during build)**\n\n```\nimport pingResponse from './controllers/ping.controller';\n\napp.get('/api/ping', async (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp: any = await pingResponse();\n  return res.json(resp);\n});\n\n```\n\n**4. Generate build using:**\n\n`npm run build`\n\n**5. angular.json config**\n\n```\n\"server\": \"src/main.server.ts\",\n\"outputMode\": \"server\",\n\"ssr\": {\n  \"entry\": \"src/server.ts\"\n}\n\n```\nI cannot move all the functions internally as all my routes rely on repository-based database queries, which are modular and imported from separate files. How to resolve this issue and ensure the Angular SSR build works with these imported functions?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

We have mocked a lot of dependencies to not run their internals.\r\n\r\nAs an example, for one component that shows a button to copy text to clipboard, we use the CDK CopyToClipboard directive. However, we ran into problems overriding the directive in our test, which was still working fine in a non-standalone situation.\r\n\r\nOn the stackblitz I've created 2 variants of the test, as we originally used @ngneat/spectator for our tests, but even with testbed I wasn't able to make it work. In the test I try to see if the console logs from the mocked component are being done but for now it doesn't take.\r\n\r\nThe code as of now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Directive, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MatIconButton } from '@angular/material/button';\r\nimport { MatIcon } from '@angular/material/icon';\r\nimport { MockComponent } from 'ng-mocks';\r\nimport { CopyToClipboardComponent } from './copy-to-clipboard.component';\r\nimport { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';\r\nimport { CdkCopyToClipboard } from '@angular/cdk/clipboard';\r\n\r\n// simple mock directive to capture the input. We're not going to test the cdk logic of the copy\r\nlet clipboardResult = '';\r\n@Directive({ selector: '[cdkCopyToClipboard]', standalone: true })\r\nclass MockCdkCopyToClipboard {\r\n  // text to copy to clipboard\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log('directive mocked'); // Problem: I'm not seeing this in the console\r\n  }\r\n  @Input() set cdkCopyToClipboard(value: string) {\r\n    console.log('text copied', value); // Problem: I'm not seeing this in the console\r\n    clipboardResult = value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndescribe('CopyToClipboardComponent - Testbed', () => {\r\n  let component: CopyToClipboardComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<CopyToClipboardComponent>;\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      imports: [\r\n        MockComponent(MatIcon),\r\n        MockComponent(MatIconButton),\r\n        MockCdkCopyToClipboard,\r\n      ],\r\n    })\r\n      /**\r\n       * suggested by https://stackoverflow.com/a/75243037/3222860\r\n       * but still doesn't show the console log from the mocked directive\r\n       */\r\n      .overrideComponent(CopyToClipboardComponent, {\r\n        remove: { imports: [CdkCopyToClipboard] },\r\n        add: { imports: [MockCdkCopyToClipboard] },\r\n      })\r\n      .createComponent(CopyToClipboardComponent);\r\n    clipboardResult = '';\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should create', () => {\r\n    expect(component).toBeTruthy();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should show the clipboard button when there is text to copy', () => {\r\n    component.textToCopy = 'test';\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n    expect(\r\n      fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('.clipboard-button')\r\n    ).toBeTruthy();\r\n    expect(clipboardResult).toEqual('test');\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // a few more tests\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the component we try to test is as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { CdkCopyToClipboard } from '@angular/cdk/clipboard';\r\nimport { Component, Input, OnChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MatIconButton } from '@angular/material/button';\r\nimport { MatIcon } from '@angular/material/icon';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Show clipboard to copy text to clipboard.\r\n * Example that I can't seem to fix when moving to standalone components.\r\n */\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-copy-to-clipboard',\r\n  template: `\r\n  @if (showButton) {\r\n    <button\r\n      class=\"clipboard-button mat-icon-button-small\"\r\n      mat-icon-button\r\n      type=\"button\"\r\n      [cdkCopyToClipboard]=\"textToCopy\"\r\n    >\r\n      <mat-icon>content_copy</mat-icon>\r\n    </button>\r\n    }\r\n    `,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [\r\n    CdkCopyToClipboard, // I can't seem to override this dependency, its always using the real one\r\n    MatIcon,\r\n    MatIconButton,\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nexport class CopyToClipboardComponent implements OnChanges {\r\n  @Input() textToCopy!: string;\r\n\r\n  showButton = false;\r\n\r\n  ngOnChanges(): void {\r\n    this.showButton = this.show();\r\n    console.log('showButton', this.showButton); // this is logging just fine\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  show() {\r\n    return (\r\n      !!this.textToCopy &&\r\n      this.textToCopy !== '-' &&\r\n      this.textToCopy?.toLowerCase() !== 'null'\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-um7c3g?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fcopy-to-clipboard.component.testbed.spec.ts\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is the directive I'm trying to mock:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/clipboard/copy-to-clipboard.ts (which is also exported as a module but I don't think we use that right now with standalone. We did use it pre-migration)\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nIt doesn't log anything from the mocked directive. I would expect it to log the items in the constructor and the input to indicate that it is being used by the tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular 18.2.3\r\nKarma 6.4.4\r\nJasmine 5.2.0\r\n@ngneat Spectator 19 (wrapper around testbed with more functionality and performance improvements)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI found it difficult to get the proper documentation for overriding as the current documentation focuses on providers rather than mocked components and directives. I often see suggestions to just use ngmocks and while it is valid, a simple mocked component or directive still makes it clearer what I want to test.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to move to Jest a few times but that also didn't work entirely (which might be related to this issue, I don't know), but we stuck with Karma/Jasmine for now. There's about 1000 tests in our project of which 73 don't work because of similar reasons to this one. It prevents us from moving to standalone components, which seems to be a bigger thing now that it has become the default in angular 19 (alpha).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57732","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mocking Directive in standalone component test doesn't work\" (#57732)"},{"Id":"2513589843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-09T10:42:12","Actor":"SriyanshNahar","Number":"57728","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace.","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nError: This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57728","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error: This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace.\" (#57728)"},{"Id":"2513535386","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-09T10:17:58","Actor":"stefanloerwald","Number":"57727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bad link to pipe documentation","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe link to the \"pipe\" documentation in https://angular.dev/best-practices/slow-computations#optimizing-slow-computations points to https://angular.dev/guide/pipes, but should likely direct to https://angular.dev/guide/templates/pipes#\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/best-practices/slow-computations\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57727","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bad link to pipe documentation\" (#57727)"},{"Id":"2512627425","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-08T23:38:52","Actor":"andriy101","Number":"57726","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Update CHANGELOG.md","State":"open","Body":"Fixing typo: reactoring -> refactoring\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This happened when the directive reflects the generic type in multiple inputs, some of which were not bound from the parent template. Since omitted inputs were passed into the directive's type constructor using the `0 as any` expression, TypeScript sees the input of type `any` as inference source of the generic type and locks that in.\r\n\r\nThe initial remediation idea was to remove omitted inputs from the type-constructor entirely, changing its type from `Pick<Dir, 'a'|'...'>` to `Partial<Pick<Dir, 'a'|'...'>>` to make all input bindings optional. This introduces issues where the `undefined` type that is introduced affects type inference, causing test failures.\r\n\r\nInstead, omitted inputs are now passed into the type constructor as `never` type, which is TypeScript's bottom type such that no inference candidates are introduced.\r\n\r\nFixes #57644\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis change is likely (too) breaking, as the inference of the `any` type used to effectively disable type-checking of any (pun not intended) expressions that reflect a generic type of a directive with missing inputs. `MatCalendar` is one such directive (the one reported in #57644) that has many inputs that reflect the generic type, where it is typical that not all those inputs are actually bound.\r\n\r\nA g3 global presubmit should help determine the impact of the breakage, which may require us to introduce this behind a compiler option.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57724","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): infer correct generic types for directives when so…\" (#57724)"},{"Id":"2512249492","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-08T17:11:53","Actor":"devversion","Number":"57719","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): avoid flow node traversal limit by optimizing traversal","State":"closed","Body":"Instead of traversing the same paths multiple times, we should avoid this extra work and optimize.

That is the reason we are using Angular SSR in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf we load, reload or SEO verify that specific route, the page source and the SEO results show the homepage information.\r\nWhen we reload the page, we can also observe, that the homepage title appears in the browser tab for a split second, before it gets replaced by the product page title.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing it turns out, if we change the homepage component to use a \"home\" route instead of an empty \" \" route, the product page information loads correctly. Furthermore, if we remove `</ion-router-outlet>` (also tested with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`), the meta information also loads corretly in the page (even though the page doesn't load of course).\r\n\r\nWe use resolvers on the homepage to fetch some data, and we have another set of resolvers for the product page.\r\n\r\nWe don't use standalone components and we don't use child modules.\r\n\r\nChanging the order of the routes, chaining resolvers, putting the Meta service inside the resolver had no effect.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aleksander351/ionic7-ssr-basic\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThere is no exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.9\r\nNode: 20.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.9\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.9\r\nrxjs                            7.5.0\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Empty path breaks routing and consequently SEO in a server side rendered Angular application\" (#57715)"},{"Id":"2512025159","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-07T21:32:35","Actor":"Nilam-Pal","Number":"57714","RawContent":null,"Title":"pipe content is not showing","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nPipe content is not visible showing 404 error\r\n pipes#built-in-pipes\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/pipes#built-in-pipes\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nAngular.dev\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nurl issue\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57714","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"pipe content is not showing\" (#57714)"},{"Id":"2512015291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-07T18:55:10","Actor":"theangular","Number":"57713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with accessing the 'subscribe' property in nested calls within Angular 2 due to it being undefined","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am trying to implement a subscription in company-list.component using the method getCompanies() from the company.service.

(A hard reload with Ctrl-F5 does not help). Also, going into a private window seems to help.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I've never been able to reproduce this issue myself (the site is [BoardGamegGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)) but the reports are quite consistent, if not super frequent. It may be the case that some users run into this problem more than other users, but I can't say that for sure. The fact that cache clearing solves the issue seems to suggest that something about how Firefox is caching is causing it to cache some corrupt file, with cascading consequences, but that is purely conjecture on my part. \r\n\r\nThis may be related to angular/angular#44780, which we also reported, although note that that dates back to when Angular was using Webpack. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nIt is possible that you might run into this browsing the Angular portions of https://boardgamegeek.com\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.4\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Intermittent module load errors in Firefox only\" (#28361)"},{"Id":"2511146966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T20:48:21","Actor":"tsteuwer-accesso","Number":"28365","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, we're running to a lot of \"Chunk loading errors\" when using CI/CD with Angular and Angular's SSR. The reason for this is because our CDN reaches out to origin to get static assets, which are served from SSR. As soon as a new build goes out, the CDN is cleared, and the new assets are now live.\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with people currently on the site as lazy-loaded chunks that are still wanting to be requested in the users browser will try to go back to origin, only for the CDN to find out they no longer exists because chunk file hashes changed, and trigger the \"Chunk loading errors\" we're constantly seeing.\r\n\r\nIn order for users to fix this, they must do a hard-refresh, something we do not want our users to have to go through, especially since we're an international company and at any point in time, we can have people millions of people on in any of our regions.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to configure where **browser** static assets are pulled. One solution we thought of is to be able to change the URL where browser assets are pulled from. Think of it like this:\r\n\r\n1.) Build 5000 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5000/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n2.) Build 5001 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5001/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n\r\nIf user was currently on 5000, the static assets from the `/5000` folder can still be loaded from our domain. If the user refreshes, and we had cleared our CDN, they would start getting `/5001` requests because the main html changed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, we're thinking about just doing a find and replace on any `./chunk` string in the output dist for `/browser` and doing this ourselves. I'm not sure if the Google team has ran into this, I'm sure they have, but I would also welcome any other solutions you guys come up with.

Delete out the 'n' & the 'e' to be left with a filter of 'O'; note that the 'myControl.value' is still `One` (due to having set `requireSelection`)\r\n4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c45088e-c38b-401a-ad4e-8d731fa00b20)\r\n5. Delete out the final 'O' from your filter; note that 'myControl.value' is again still `One`\r\n6. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\r\n7. In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2510479984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-09T06:43:00","Actor":"typescripterpro","Number":"29702","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding markers to a map in Angular 2 using ngOnInit after initialization","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEmbarking on my Angular journey by creating a sample app incorporating GoogleMaps.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit, Inject } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\nimport { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport Appcomponent = require(\"../app.component\");\r\nimport Accident = Appcomponent.Accident;\r\ndeclare var google: any;\r\ndeclare let map: any\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-map',\r\n  templateUrl: 'map.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./map.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class MapComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  private http: HttpClient;\r\n  private baseUrl: string;\r\n\r\n  private tags: string[];\r\n  private accidents: Accident[];\r\n  private accidentsMarkers: any[] = [];\r\n  private markers: any[] = [];\r\n\r\n  constructor(http: HttpClient, @Inject('BASE_URL') baseUrl: string) {\r\n    this.http = http;\r\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    var mapProp = {\r\n      center: new google.maps.LatLng(51.508742, -0.120850),\r\n      zoom: 5,\r\n      mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(\"googleMap\"), mapProp);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  public loadAccidents(): void {\r\n    this.http.get<Accident[]>(this.baseUrl + 'api/accidents').subscribe(result => {\r\n      this.accidents = result;\r\n\r\n      this.accidents.forEach(function (accident) {\r\n        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({\r\n          position: new google.maps.LatLng(accident.location.coordinates.lat,\r\n            accident.location.coordinates.lon),\r\n          map: this.map,\r\n          title: \"\"\r\n        });\r\n        this.markers.push(marker);\r\n      });\r\n    }, error => console.error(error));    \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Same \r\n\r\nhttps://qanswer.space/questions/adding-markers-to-a-map-in-angular-2-using-ngoninit-after-initialization\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhile I initialized map in ngOnInit, attempting to access it in loadAccidents results in an error message:\r\n\r\n`ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'markers' of undefined`\r\n\r\nThe order of execution suggests that the constructor is called prior to ngOnInit.

However, I’ve encountered an issue specifically in Firefox: when the context menu opens, the selected text is unexpectedly unselected.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, it appears that Firefox may automatically deselect text when focus shifts to elements outside the text container. While this behavior might be a limitation inherent to Firefox, I believe it is worth documenting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the official CDK context menu example includes mocked \"copy\" and \"cut\" options, which exacerbates this issue.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior something that can be addressed, or is it an inherent limitation of how Firefox handles text selection and focus?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: cf. https://material.angular.io/cdk/menu/examples\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

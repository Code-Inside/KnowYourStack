This could lead to issues in server-side rendering environments where multiple requests are processed concurrently, as they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state.\r\n\r\nTo address this, the bootstrapping process now explicitly passes the `platformInjector` through the `bootstrapServerApplication` and `renderApplication` functions. This ensures that each server-side render has its own isolated platform injector, preventing state leakage between requests.\r\n\r\nThe `bootstrapApplication` function will now throw an error when used on the server. Instead, developers should use the newly introduced `bootstrapServerApplication` function from `@angular/platform-server`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `getPlatform()` and `destroyPlatform()` will now return `null` and be a no-op respectively when running in a server environment.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n- `bootstrapApplication` can no longer be used on the server. Instead, `bootstrapServerApplication` from `@angular/platform-server` should be used.\r\n\r\n- `renderApplication` now requires the return value of `bootstrapServerApplication`.\r\n\r\n- `getPlatform()` and `destroyPlatform()` are now no-ops on the server and `getPlatform()` will return `null`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63562","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-server): update server bootstrap API\" (#63562)"},{"Id":"3378366839","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-03T05:31:29","Actor":"chriswoodie","Number":"63561","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content inside @defer(hydrate never) stays on page after navigating to another page","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using SSR and `@defer (hydrate never)` for components that's supposed to be completely static, I've found that the components remain on the page when navigating to another one.

Previously, the runner would write bundled test files to a temporary directory on disk. This exposed intermediate build artifacts to the user in test output and incurred an unnecessary performance penalty from disk I/O.\r\n\r\nWith this change, a custom Vite plugin now serves all test-related files (including test entry points, code chunks, and polyfills) directly from the in-memory build results. This provides two key benefits:\r\n\r\n1.  **Improved Developer Experience**: Vitest now operates on the original TypeScript source file paths. This ensures that test output, error messages, and stack traces correctly reference the files authored by the developer, simplifying debugging.\r\n2.  **Increased Performance**: By eliminating all disk writes and the need for a temporary output directory, the test setup is faster and more efficient, especially in watch mode.\r\n\r\nCloses #30822\r\nCloses

[`v21.0.0-next.2`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next2-2025-09-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/21.0.0-next.1...21.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n- (test only) - `TestBed` now provides a fake `PlatformLocation`\n  implementation that supports the Navigation API. This may break some\n  tests, though we have not observed any failures internally. You can revert to the\n  old default for `TestBed` by providing the `MockPlatformLocation` from\n  `@angular/common/testing` in your providers:\n  `{provide: PlatformLocation, useClass: MockPlatformLocation}`\n\n##### core\n\n- (test only) - Using `provideZoneChangeDetection` in the\n  TestBed providers would previously prevent `TestBed` from rethrowing\n  errors as it should. Errors in the test will now be rethrown, regardless\n  of the usage of `provideZoneChangeDetection`. Tests should be adjusted to\n  prevent or account for these errors. As in previous major versions,\n  this behavior can be disabled with `rethrowApplicationErrors: false` in\n  `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n- `ignoreChangesOutsideZone` is no longer available as an\n  option for configuring ZoneJS change detection behavior.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n- The deprecated `ApplicationConfig` export from `@angular/platform-browser` has been removed.\n  Please import `ApplicationConfig` from `@angular/core` instead.\n\n##### router\n\n- Router navigations may take several additional\n  microtasks to complete. Tests have been found to often be highly\n  dependent on the exact timing of navigation completions with respect to\n  the microtask queue. The most common fix for tests is to ensure all\n  navigations have been completed before making assertions. On rare\n  occasions, this can also affect production applications. This can be\n  caused by multiple subscriptions to router state throughout the application,\n  both of which trigger navigations that happened to not conflict with the\n  previous timing.\n\n##### upgrade\n\n- `UpgradeAdapter` is no longer available. Use\n  `upgrade/static` instead\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description

Private variables were\n  always intended to be fully encapsulated within the module that defines them,\n  and this helps enforce that encapsulation.\n\n- Fix a bug where `@extend` rules loaded through a mixture of `@import` and\n  `@use` rules could fail to apply correctly.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n- In `--watch` mode, delete the source map when the associated source file is\n  deleted.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.44.0`](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5440)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.43.1...v5.44.0)\n\n- Support `using` and `await using` declarations ([#&#8203;1635](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/issues/1635))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But I am not sure where to file that, and this seems like this should be on the radar for the Material docs users using Firefox.\n\nI was trying to run Material doc examples in Firefox. After messing around, I was able to fix it by commenting out some of the root SCSS. In particular, something about the `@use '@angular/material' as mat` will cause Firefox ran Stackblitz projects to hang on the `\"ng serve --> Building...\"` phase in the terminal and `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\nBelow is what has to be done to any Material styled file to get them to work, nullifying theming.\n\n```scss\n// @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 30px;\n  height: 100%;\n\n  // @include mat.theme((\n  //   color: (\n  //     theme-type: light,\n  //     primary: mat.$azure-palette,\n  //     tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\n  //   ),\n  //   typography: Roboto,\n  //   density: 0,\n  // ));\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSame applies to other theming file locations, like in-component styles which are just \n\n```ts\n  styles: `\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n  `,\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Broken: 20.1 with styling (won't ever finish building and actually load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\n- Works: 20.1 without styling (will load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi-uz1gcmh1?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\nAdditionally, here are links from the v18 and v19 docs that can pop open a pre-existing Stackblitz with the same issue\n\n- 18: https://v18.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n- 19: https://v19.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox\n2. Open both links\n3. Observe that \"20.1 without styling\" loads\n4. Observe that \"20.1 with styling\" hangs\n5. Note the difference between both's root `styles.scss`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nApp serves and loads\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nApp hangs on \"ng serve --> Building...\" in the terminal and the `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\n### Environment\n\nThis applies to any previous version using the new theming API, so v18 and v19 as well as v20.

URI to render its dotted buffer animation via a background-image style. \nThis is a change from Angular Material v14, where the SVG was injected directly into the DOM.\nWhile the SVG itself is static and safe, this implementation forces developers who use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to enable img-src data:, [which is widely considered a security risk as it opens a potential vector for XSS attacks](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#:~:text=In%20either%20case%2C%20developers%20SHOULD,they%20are%20best%20avoided%20completely.): \"(...)developers SHOULD NOT include (...) data: as valid sources in their policies.\"\nContent Secruity Policy does not allow to be specific to allow only one particular data: URI.\n\nI tried to generate a sha256 from the SVG based on what is output in the Google Chrome console : \n```\nRefused to load the image 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'%3E%3Ccircle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/%3E%3C/svg%3E' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=' https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googletagmanager.com\".\n```\n`w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=` is the sha256 I get with this script :\n``` bash\necho -n \"<svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'><circle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/></svg>\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64\n```\nMy CSP image source looks like to `img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g='` and the error is still raising.\nDebuging this is very time-consuming.\n\nThis is a significant regression from the v14 behavior, which was CSP-friendly out-of-the-box.\n\nProposed Solution / Suggestion:\n1. Please consider reverting to the previous implementation of injecting the SVG directly into the DOM.\n2. Providing an alternative mechanism that does not rely on data: URIs for styling. \n\nThis would greatly simplify CSP implementation for security-conscious applications. Thank you!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create an Angular application with a strict Content Security Policy that does not include img-src data:. For example: img-src 'self';.\n2. Use the <mat-progress-bar mode=\"buffer\"></mat-progress-bar> component.\n3. Observe the browser console for CSP errors related to a blocked data: URI.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe mat-progress-bar component should render without violating a strict CSP that disallows data: URIs for images. The v14 approach of injecting an inline element into the DOM was ideal, as it did not require any changes to img-src.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe component attempts to load a background-image with a data: URI, violating the CSP and preventing the buffer animation from rendering.\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1.7\n- CDK/Material: 20.1.6\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): TuxedoOS (Ubuntu 24.04 based) and Windows 10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31808","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-progress-bar): Use of `data:` URI for buffer SVG is a regression that complicates strict CSP implementation\" (#31808)"},{"Id":"3363793893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T17:30:06","Actor":"RomainActemium","Number":"31801","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(google-maps): mapDblclick not firing on AdvancedMarkerElement","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm using @angular/google-maps and AdvancedMarkerElement to display custom markers on my Google Map.

This causes the two distinct `02:00` times (DST vs standard) on the fallback day to collapse into one — selecting the non-DST `02:00` ends up mapped to the DST `02:00`.\n\n### Custom DateAdapter:\nTo ensure consistent Luxon `DateTime` handling, I replaced the default `LuxonDateAdapter` with a custom one.\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomDateAdapter extends LuxonDateAdapter {\n  protected override locale = DateTimeService.LOCALE;\n\n  constructor() {\n    super(DATE_FORMATS);\n  }\n\n  /** Ensure datepicker provides Luxon DateTimes in the default zone */\n  public override createDate(year: number, month: number, date: number): DateTime {\n    return super.createDate(year, month, date)\n      .setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE)\n      .setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Needed so the timepicker does not treat DST and non-DST versions of the same wall time as equal.\n   * Without this, both values are considered the same and the DST one always “wins”.\n   */\n  public override sameTime(first: DateTime | null, second: DateTime | null): boolean {\n    if (!isDefined(first) || !isDefined(second)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    return +first === +second;\n  }\n\n  public override clone(date: DateTime): DateTime {\n    let cloned = super.clone(date);\n    cloned = cloned.setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE);\n    cloned = cloned.setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n    return cloned;\n  }\n}\n´´´\n\nDespite these adjustments, the underlying `_assignUserSelection` logic in the timepicker still collapses the two 02:00 times into one, because of how it uses the last valid date + setTime.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fyaws5vk\nSteps to reproduce:\n* Use the custom CustomDateAdapter (above) instead of the default LuxonDateAdapter.\nOn the DST end day ( 2025-10-26), try selecting both 02:00 (DST) and 02:00 (STD).\n* Observe that selecting the 02:00 (STD) still results in the 02:00 (DST) value being applied (or both depending on Custom vs LuxonDateAdapter).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* The timepicker should treat 02:00 DST and 02:00 STD as distinct values when using a fixed timezone.\n* Selecting the standard-time 02:00 should not be coerced into the DST-time 02:00.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* Because `_assignUserSelection` rebuilds the target date and applies extracted hours, the ambiguous hour is resolved to the earlier offset (DST).\n* Even with a custom adapter that distinguishes times (`sameTime` override), the timepicker ends up normalizing both selections to the DST instance.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome, ...\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n\n- Custom DateAdapter: subclass of LuxonDateAdapter (see above)\n- Timezone: Europe/Vienna\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(timepicker): Timepicker DST edge case: incorrect hour mapping with fixed timezone + custom Luxon adapter\" (#31803)"},{"Id":"3364051758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T17:01:37","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31802","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group","State":"open","Body":"WIP: fixing tests\r\n\r\n--\r\nThis change makes composite patterns work in a natural data-down flow with no more circular dependencies.\r\n\r\nProblems with current implementation\r\n- Toolbar and Radio Group are strongly coupled, each patterns contain complex conditional logics when each other pattern exists to handle event listener conflicts.\r\n- This also creates circular dependencies, and there are many `...Like` interfaces created as a workaround.\r\n- Not future proof. The above two problems will grow exponentially if a pattern needs to support multiple composite patterns.\r\n\r\nWith this refactoring\r\n- Event handlers are pulled out from patterns, and instead patterns provide actions of what they are capable to do.\r\n- Radio Group supports two sets of actions - as regular radio group and as a sub group in a toolbar.\r\n- Toolbar supports a new child pattern - Widget Group, which will treat everything inside as a blackbox. What it does is passing down the interactions from Toolbar, and whatever in the blackbox should handle those interactions.\r\n- Now the control-flow becomes clear\r\n  - On the top level, Toolbar-Interaction converts keyboard/pointer events into available Toolbar actions\r\n  - Widget and Widget Groups are both list items. If the current `activeItem` is a Widget Group, then keep passing down the Toolbar action.\r\n  - Whatever inside the Widget Group(in this case it's Radio Group) takes the instructions from Widget Group and handle the interactions by themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a result\r\n- This solves event handler conflicts in a composite pattern as patterns no longer need to bind their event handlers to a DOM.\r\n- Composite pattern parent no longer need to know what children patterns they are controlling. They only need to pass down instructions, and children patterns should implement their interop layer to handle those instructions, and return necessary information to the parent. Very typical Data Down Action Up style.\r\n- This approach also enables the potential of supporting non-Angular Aria library components, for example, as long as Material Radio Group can act on instructions sent from Widget Group, then it can be used within the Angular Aria Toolbar, without having to tweak anything inside the Toolbar. It can't be done with the current implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31802","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group\" (#31802)"},{"Id":"3362104721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T07:20:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31798","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: define typescript version via string in module.bazel file","State":"closed","Body":"Within our module.bazel file when describing the version of typescript to use for rules_ts, we use ts_version instead of ts_version_from to prevent our package.json file from being part of the set of files used to calculate the sha for the lock file.

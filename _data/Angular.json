Such directives should not\r\nbe registered in an NgModule, but can still contain decorators for\r\ninputs, outputs, queries, etc. The information from these decorators and\r\nthe `@Directive()` decorator itself needs to be registered with the\r\ncentral `MetadataRegistry` so that other areas of the compiler can\r\nrequest information about a given directive, an example of which is the\r\ntemplate type checker that needs to know about the inputs and outputs of\r\ndirectives.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, however, abstract directives would only register\r\nthemselves with the `MetadataRegistry` as being an abstract directive,\r\nwithout all of its other metadata like inputs and outputs. This meant\r\nthat the template type checker was unable to resolve the inputs and\r\noutputs of these abstract directives, therefore failing to check them\r\ncorrectly. The typical error would be that some property does not exist\r\non a DOM element, whereas said property should have been bound to the\r\nabstract directive's input.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the problem by always registering the metadata of a\r\ndirective or component with the `MetadataRegistry`.

In another sense, this is a limitation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there are the limitations of:\r\n\r\n- Directives matched on the element, but with a selector of anything\r\n  more than the attribute (e.g. `div[string-model]` or\r\n  `[string-model][other-attr]`) will not be returned as symbols matching\r\n  on the attribute.\r\n- Only one symbol can be returned currently. If the attribute matches\r\n  multiple directives, only one directive symbol will be returned.\r\n  Furthermore, we cannot say that the directive symbol returned is\r\n  determinstic.\r\n\r\nResolution of these limitations can be discussed in the future.

The application generated with the latest stable version 8 does not have this bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI've started using Angular with Semantic UI.\r\n\r\nSome features of Semantic UI rely on order of css classes in class attribute. However Angular is changing order of css classes in class attribute while rendering. E.g. from\r\n\r\n```\r\n      <div class=\"ui left icon input\">\r\n        <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search users...\" />\r\n        <i class=\"users icon\"></i>\r\n      </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"icon input left ui\"><input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search users...\"><i class=\"icon users\"></i></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n`ui left icon input` was changed to `icon input left ui`. As a result icon is incorrectly positioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nJust generate app with `ng new` with version 9 dependencies and put this into the template of the app component\r\n\r\n```\r\n      <div class=\"ui left icon input\">\r\n        <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search users...\" />\r\n        <i class=\"users icon\"></i>\r\n      </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then compare order of classes in rendered HTML in the browser\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-next.9\r\nNode: 10.16.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-next.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-next.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-next.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-next.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-next.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-next.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-next.9\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-next.9\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-next.9\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-next.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-next.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.41.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33111","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular is changing order of css classes in class attribute\" (#33111)"},{"Id":"506021084","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T19:28:38","Actor":"kara","Number":"33110","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): rename ngDirectiveDef to ɵdir ","State":"open","Body":"Directive defs are not considered public API, so the property\r\nthat contains them should be prefixed with Angular's marker\r\nfor \"private\" ('ɵ') to discourage apps from relying on def\r\nAPIs directly.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the prefix and shortens the name from\r\nngDirectiveDef to dir.

Can't say whether it worked in a former CLI-version.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm working on a project that includes several different frontends based on Angular 8. Each frontend is a separate Angular 8 project with its own folder substructure. Their root folders are all located in the same main folder.\r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1\r\n        |___ frontend2\r\n        ...\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicate code and to optimize code refactoring we've come to the decision to put repetitive code into a \"base\" folder and import it via the paths option set in `tsconfig.json`. \r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1/\r\n        |___ frontend2/\r\n        ...\r\n        |___ base-ui/\r\n\r\nWe started with a simple class representing collections of constants that are used throughout the entire frontend landscape. This class is located inside the file `constants.ts` which is to be found in the folder `base-ui/constants`\r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1/\r\n        |___ frontend2/\r\n        ...\r\n        |___ base-ui/constants/constants.ts\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is our `tsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"compileOnSave\": false,\r\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\r\n        \"outDir\": \"./dist/out-tsc\",\r\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n        \"declaration\": false,\r\n        \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\r\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\r\n        \"importHelpers\": true,\r\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n        \"typeRoots\": [\r\n          \"node_modules/@types\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"lib\": [\r\n          \"es2018\",\r\n          \"dom\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"types\": [\r\n          \"hammerjs\",\r\n          \"jasmine\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n          \"@shared/*\": [\r\n            \"../base-ui/*\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is the very simple content of `constants.ts`\r\n\r\n    export class BaseServerConstants {\r\n        public static readonly LOGOUT_URL = 'server/logout';\r\n        public static readonly LOGIN_URL = 'server/login';\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is how we import/use it\r\n\r\n    import { BaseServerConstants } from '@shared/constants/constants';\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    performLogout(): void {\r\n        window.location.href = BaseServerConstants.LOGOUT_URL;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works like a charm as long as we just code or build the projects with `ng build` or `ng build --prod`.\r\n\r\nBut using `ng serve` inside the console of IntelliJ or VS Code always leads to the same error message which says:\r\n\r\n    ERROR in /Users/developer/theproject/base-ui/constants/constants.ts\r\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'tslib' in '/Users/developer/theproject/base-ui/constants'\r\n\r\nWhy does this happen? Why am I actually able to use this paths option successfully with `ng build` and compile/transpile an entire application which works as expected afterwards?\r\n\r\nBut when this code is supposed to run by `ng serve` it won't compile?! Why is `ng serve` clinging to expecting entire modules only that get imported by the paths option? \r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug from my point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nJust create a folder structure similar to mine and import an external class as I did to your dummy project(s) as explained above. Then use `ng serve` in order to run your code locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.0\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.0\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.0\r\n@angular/material                 8.1.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThis problem appears across all platforms.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15820","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI 8. “ng serve” fails when using “paths” in tsconfig.json\" (#15820)"},{"Id":"505912158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T15:15:46","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15819","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support multiple configurations in commands and target strings","State":"open","Body":"It's now possible to use multiple configurations by separating them with a comma:\r\n```\r\nng build --configuration=one,two,three\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey will be applied from left to right.

This wasn't ideal as I am using the new Sass module only available in dart-sass.\r\n\r\nThe bug is caused by first checking for node-sass. This problem can be fixed by instead checking for the sass package (as it's the newer alternative from the perspective of the CLI), then falling back to node-sass if sass isn't present.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/styles.ts#L125-L131\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nReproduced by having node-sass present in your node_modules.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nErrors related to having node-sass try to compile Sass 1.23.0 code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-next.6\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-next.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular/material                  8.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-next.6\r\nng-packagr                         5.5.1\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.41.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

contain `entryComponents` like so:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [PageLayoutComponent],\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, WchNgComponentsModule],\r\n  entryComponents: [PageLayoutComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class PageLayoutModule {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen adding this module to my application module, the `PageLayoutComponent` component will be part of the final bundle, no matter whether its is referenced by a template, a route or the bootstrap process. This works for both AOT and JIT mode.\r\n\r\nWith Ivy enabled this is **not** the case, the component is NOT part of the final bundle, despite the fact that it is referenced as an entry component.\r\nIn JIT mode the component is included, in AOT mode it is not.\r\n\r\nFor my usecase this is a problem because I am attaching a custom decorator to the component and I expect this decorator to execute when the module is loaded. This in turn is done to be able to dynamically instantiate these components without having to reference them explicitly, the custom decorator registers the components.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.5\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.5\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

For example, `ngx-infinite-scroll` is one of the commonly used plugins (87k weekly downloads) that allow loading contents as soon as user reaches to the bottom of the page. When we set `fullscreen` on `mat-sidenav-container` , `ngx-infinite-scroll` no longer works. As reported here\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50377502/angular-material-and-ngx-infinite-scroll?rq=1\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/orizens/ngx-infinite-scroll/issues/182\r\n\r\nWhat if we apply the below styles of `fullscreen` mode **only** when the side nav is opened:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  top: 0!important;\r\n  left: 0!important;\r\n  right: 0!important;\r\n  bottom: 0!important;\r\n  position: absolute!important;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way it wont affect the other portion of the application.

For some situations with a parent/child relationship (such as projected content) the parent needs to be able to programmatically set values of the Inputs as they don't have access to set the template bindings.\r\n\r\nAs a component library author there are often cases where we allow something like an `icon` component to be projected.  The `icon` component has an input that allows several sizes.  When the `icon` is used in a specific component in a projection slot that component can query through a `ContentChildren` query.  That component can further set the value of the `@Input` to \"enforce\" a given size.  This \"parent\" component can't set the value through the template bindings as it doesn't have template access to projected content, just component class instances.\r\n\r\nHere's a non-working example of where a `parent` component allows projected `icon` components.  It is trying to query for `icon` content and then set the `size` input.  We've been able to accomplish in the past with `@Inputs` and the getter/setter pattern.  We'd love to be able to move to Input signals but this blocks us.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-g5jzxx?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fparent%2Fparent.component.ts\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSome way for consumers to set the value of an Input programmatically.  I realize they are read-only but this breaks the notion of a component not knowing how it is consumed and used.  Consumers are allowed to set Inputs through the template OR through the component class instance with a reference.  \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can continue to use a getter/setter syntax to fake Input signals.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Input() get size(): number {\r\n  return this._size;\r\n}\r\n\r\nset size(value: number) {\r\n   this._size.set(value);\r\n}\r\nprivate _size = signal();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nicer and easier to maintain if we can utilize Input signals programmatically. \r\n\r\n\r\nModel Inputs are also a potential option\r\n\r\nI don't feel that the `Model` inputs are the solution here as that would mean all of our Inputs would have to be Model inputs because as component library authors we don't know how a consumer will access our Inputs (via template or programmatically).  Whereas Model inputs more feels like it's trying to solve ControlValueAccessor stuff and not necessarily meant for this.

It is important to address this bug and restore the display of build duration in the console after executing ng build.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nno\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                    17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27233","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing build duration display after ng build in Angular v17.1.0\" (#27233)"},{"Id":"2173545939","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-08T15:26:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27235","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): ensure proper display of build logs in the presence of warnings or errors","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nPreviously, a race condition could occur due to the spinner, resulting in the deletion of the last printed log when warnings or errors were present.

caret for a reason: teams consuming the library do deploy their applications sometime into subdirectories, so this caret was needed to resolve the path correctly.\r\n\r\n// angular.json\r\n

This breaks a development configuration that has worked since the beginning of angular-cli. As explained [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27152#issuecomment-1979033125), the rationale for this removal seems to be that no one should have been using `deployUrl` with `dev-server`, and that it was being set erroneously with the webpack server as well. I commented on this in the pull request, but now that this has been released, it seemed that a bug report made sense.\r\n\r\nOur use case, as I understand it, requires using `deployUrl` for serving with `dev-server`. If I am mistaken, I'd be happy to change our developer configuration accordingly, but I don't see how we can use `dev-server` without `deploy-url`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nOur use case is as follows: In production, our application contains hybrid between an older, non-Angular parts and updated Angular parts. It is served primarily from an nginx/php server we'll call `example.com`. The angular code is build and served (with `deployUrl`) from a CDN. So, for example, a user might load `https://example.com/foo`, which might be an angular page (the php server will return the angular `index.html`, which then loads the rest of the angular from the CDN, due to `deployUrl`), and then click over to `https://example.com/bar`, which might be an old non-angular page, and thus will be served directly by the php server. It all works seamlessly to the user.\r\n\r\nOur development environments mirror our production environment.  Each developer has a remote development server, e.g., `dev-devname.example.com`. Instead of deploying the fully compiled angular code to a CDN, each developer runs `ng serve` locally from localhost:4200. `deployUrl` is set to `//localhost:4200`, and we `rsync` a copy of `index.html` over to the dev server so that it can be served by our php application when appropriate. `localhost` acts exactly like the CDN in this scenario, and `deployUrl` is what makes it work. The developer loads, for example, `https://dev-devname.example.com/foo`, php serves up `index.html`, and Angular is loaded from `localhost` (our fake CDN, in this case).\r\n\r\nThis has worked well for us since Angular CLI was introduced, and, except for a small, easily remedied issue with the url for the vite server( #27152), worked well when we transitioned from webpack to the `es-build` server. I was super happy to see that `deployUrl` was being added for the `application` builder as well, and I hope that this issue can be resolved so that we can continue to keep up with the latest Angular improvements!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.3\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27224","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disabling deployUrl with dev-server breaks existing use case\" (#27224)"},{"Id":"2173458637","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-07T10:19:14","Actor":"guilhermebentomarques","Number":"27234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prerender not generating files when strict mode is true","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I run the command \r\n\r\n`node --max_old_space_size=8192 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng run ui:prerender:qa`\r\n\r\nWith the following config\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"prerender\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@nguniversal/builders:prerender\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"guessRoutes\": false,\r\n            \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser\",\r\n            \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server\",\r\n            \"routesFile\": \"./src/prerender-routes.txt\",\r\n            \"numProcesses\": 4\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser:production\",\r\n              \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server:production\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"qa\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser:qa\",\r\n              \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server:qa\"\r\n            },\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n        \r\nThe prerender-routes.txt has only one line (for test)\r\n       \r\n` /about-us`\r\n\r\nThe step of prerendering routes never happpen.\r\n\r\ntsconfig file with strict true.\r\n\r\n`\"strict\": true,`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/10928446/d66f1b89-3f1a-4fe7-a5da-2f888d7fee0b)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the tsconfig file with strict false, everything works fine.\r\n\r\n`\"strict\": false,`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/10928446/6c0b1372-7faf-4b32-af9b-be4f4a572804)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nnode --max_old_space_size=8192 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng run ui:prerender\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThere is no error or exception the process just finishes without prerendering the files with I'm using strict mode.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.19.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@nguniversal/builders           15.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/common             15.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     15.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nIs there any way that I can know the reason that the files are not being generated?

This works fine if the user navigates by keyboard, and if the user try to go outside the dialog because the backdrop capture mouse clicks. But if the user goes to the browser chrome, like the URL bar, and then navigates with the keyboard to the page content, the focus is transferred to elements behind the dialog, making the dialog ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the dialog implementation because I display another kind of dialogs, using a custom CDK's Overlay and ConfigurableFocusTrapFactory and it can capture this kind of navigation, so this bug doesn't look like part of the focus trap implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is what I do that works fine on my custom dialog based on CDK's Overlay:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nconst focusTrap = this.focusTrapFactory.create(containerElem);\r\nfocusTrap.focusInitialElementWhenReady();\r\noverlayRef.detachments().subscribe(() => focusTrap.destroy());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Maybe start implementing the dialog component on top of the dialog element could help avoid having to use focus traps, when browser compatibility requirements allows for it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Also, this propose could also fix a bug affecting `FormBuilder` which returns the wrong type when dealing with objects\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\nWhen building a strictly-typed `FormGroup`, it expects an interface having already the right types defined for its properties, i.e.:\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface SomeInterface {\r\n  foo: string;\r\n  bar: {\r\n    baz: number;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface SomeInterfaceForm {\r\n  foo: FormControl<string>;\r\n  bar: FormGroup<{\r\n    baz: FormControl<number>;\r\n  }>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this is a limitation when dealing with API, because it forces to duplicate interfaces in order to define the right types for `FormGroup`. Also, this may be the source of possible bugs because changes in API's data should be reflected also in form interface.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if using `FormBuilder`, the resulting type is not correctly inferred:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst fg = formBuilder.group<SomeInterface>({\r\n  foo: '',\r\n  bar: {\r\n    baz: 0\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfg.controls.bar.controls // Error: Property 'controls' does not exist on type 'FormControl<{ baz: number; }>'\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose to create and expose a helper type able to infer the correct type given its input, something like the following:\r\n```typescript\r\ntype Controls<T> = { [k in keyof T]: Form<T[k]> }\r\ntype Form<T> = [T] extends [boolean | number | string | null | undefined] ? FormControl<T> :\r\n               [T] extends [(infer U)[]] ? FormArray<Form<U>> :\r\n               FormGroup<Controls<T>>\r\n```\r\nand apply it to `FormGroup` like:\r\n```typescript\r\nclass FormGroup<T> {\r\n  constructor(public controls: Controls<T>) {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, one can define a `FormGroup` starting from API interface in this way:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst fg = new FormGroup<SomeInterface>({\r\n  foo: new FormControl<string>('')\r\n  // ...\r\n}):\r\n```\r\nhaving back `SomeInterface` when accessing `fg.value` (related to #46073)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46864","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Strictly typed FormGroup improvement\" (#46864)"},{"Id":"1306978128","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-17T08:35:44","Actor":"Piyush132000","Number":"46861","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unnecessary code","State":"closed","Body":"I have removed unnecessary code from the components & i initialize the form in OnInit function (life cycle).

After a lot of digging around I was actually able to get all the requirements for runtime translations running using all the things Angular offers. So it is really just the poor documentation that takes a lot of time on debugging and finding the right functions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest to add a section to the `Internationalization` guide under `Optional internationalization practices`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn this guide I would cover the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Describe pros and cons of runtime translations (why would someone want that)\r\n2. Explain the necessary functions/variables (`loadTranslations`, `$localize.locale`, `registerLocaleData`, `LOCALE_ID`)\r\n3. Describe the required format of the JSON file for `loadTranslations` and potentially a script to parse `xliff` to `JSON`\r\n4. Show a minimal/simple setup for the `main.ts` and `app.module.ts` for the right initialization\r\n      1. Read locale from `LocalStorage`\r\n      2. Load the translation file using `fetch`\r\n      3. Call `loadTranslations` and init `$localize.locale`\r\n      5. Show how to lazy load only the required locale from `@angular/common/locales/` using webpack\r\n      6. Call `registerLocaleData`\r\n      7. Bootstrap app by dynamically importing `AppModule` **after** loading translations to also translate static variables (see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46783#issuecomment-1183558559))\r\n      8. Set `LOCALE_ID` in `AppModule`\r\n4. Some further considerations\r\n\r\nI am happy to create a PR for this guide as soon as somebody from the Angular team gives me green light for it.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWe could also extends the documentations for `loadTranslation` and `registerLocaleData` but then the developers still need to find out that these functions even exist.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46851","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add doc section for runtime translations in internationalization guide\" (#46851)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1308808993","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-18T23:45:54","Actor":"zehavibarak","Number":"23598","RawContent":null,"Title":"build fails on memory","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng build\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails with the following stack:\r\n\r\n Generating browser application bundles (phase: building)...node:internal/buffer:959\r\n    super(bufferOrLength, byteOffset, length);\r\n    ^\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nRangeError: Array buffer allocation failed\r\n    at new ArrayBuffer (<anonymous>)\r\n    at new Uint8Array (<anonymous>)\r\n    at new FastBuffer (node:internal/buffer:959:5)\r\n    at createUnsafeBuffer (node:internal/buffer:1062:12)\r\n    at Function.allocUnsafeSlow (node:buffer:388:10)\r\n    at read (\\node_modules\\@angular-devkit\\build-angular\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\serialization\\FileMiddleware.js:597:32)\r\n    at \\node_modules\\@angular-devkit\\build-angular\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\serialization\\FileMiddleware.js:657:7\r\n    at \\node_modules\\graceful-fs\\graceful-fs.js:362:16\r\n    at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (node:fs:201:23)\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.3\r\nNode: 18.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.14.0\r\nOS: win32 ia32\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.3\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout            13.0.0-beta.38\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.3\r\nng-packagr                      14.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\nwebpack                         5.73.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n### More Info\r\n\r\nLarge project, 35Mb in previous development build.\r\n\r\nNode environment variable set to --max-old-space-size=16384.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23598","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"build fails on memory\" (#23598)"},{"Id":"1308561561","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-18T20:30:29","Actor":"avarndell","Number":"23597","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/index.js): Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->No\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nI separated my code into modules and now I'm getting the following errors with no other explanation.

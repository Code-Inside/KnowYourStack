This helps developers to catch possible typos like `http.request('POTS', ...)`, but can result in compilation errors when updating if you have such typos in your code. In the rare cases where developers used a temporary string variable to store the method, the type of this variable must be updated to be a string literal, for example `const method = 'GET' as const`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44328","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(common): stricter type for http methods\" (#44328)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1069845574","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T22:12:18","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"22286","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v12.2.14\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22286","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v12.2.14\" with changelog.\" (#22286)"},{"Id":"1069953335","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T20:27:54","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"22288","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematic to make a new schematic","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [X] generate\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt came up in an Angular Nation discussion today that making a new schematic is really difficult and requires a lot of steps with complex documentation.

The closest things that exists are probably NPM and GitHub, which tend to be tagged \"schematics\" by convention, which is not intuitive to look for. The lack of discoverability makes it harder for user schematics to find their users beyond simple word of mouth.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe should consider some kind of search functionality (either within the Angular CLI `ng add --search` or something in `schematics` directly) which looks for compatible packages on NPM. \"Compatible\" packages could be identified by inspecting the contents for the relevant JSON files or just looking for a \"schematics\" tag. Using a specific tag in the CLI could also help the community standardize on a particular convention to improve consistency. This could help improve discoverability of schematics.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe most obvious workaround is to search for schematics via your favorite search engine or directly on NPM. These are reasonable approaches, but will vary wildly in quality and may not be obvious to many devs who may not know what tags to search for.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22287","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Search schematics\" (#22287)"},{"Id":"1069548004","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T18:04:31","Actor":"alessandro-tucci-visiontech","Number":"22280","RawContent":null,"Title":"The dependence on @ampproject/remapping@1.0.1 should be updated to 1.0.2 due to a blocking issue during `ng build`","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular@12.2.13`  depends on `@ampproject/remapping@1.0.1`, which is affected by this blocking issue: https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/issues/153\r\n\r\nThe issue was quickly fixed and a new version `@ampproject/remapping@1.0.2` was released just yesterday.\r\nLike reported in the linked page, the issue affects all the projects having at least one library containing at least one .js file made up of just a source map and no additional content.

The current solution is duplicating code with `*ngIf`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"myCondition\" [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"!myCondition\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why This is Needed\r\nAt first sight, it doesn't look that terrible, but as we start to add other attributes (classes, i18n suff, and other directives), and as the button content also becomes richer (with icons and internationalized text). The code duplication is hard to maintain and can easily introduce bugs in our app.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith the current workaround, the code grows to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"!myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething()>\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith this proposal, the code would only need to be modified slightly:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Note**: Creating a bogus empty submenu does not work as a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nVery often I find the need to have a menu, where their submenus are conditional.

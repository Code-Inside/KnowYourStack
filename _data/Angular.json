This involves executing the command ng add @angular/pwa. Initially, everything functions as intended. However, upon testing a scenario where the server experiences an outage or is offline, I observed that the cache storage is being cleared and the service worker is removed.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that there are no problems when the client is in an offline state. After investigating the ngsw-worker.js file, I identified a specific code segment responsible for triggering this cache clearance. The code is within the fetchLatestManifest function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync fetchLatestManifest(ignoreOfflineError = false) {\r\n  const res = await this.safeFetch(this.adapter.newRequest(\"ngsw.json?ngsw-cache-bust=\" + Math.random()));\r\n  if (!res.ok) {\r\n    if (res.status === 404) {\r\n      await this.deleteAllCaches();\r\n      await this.scope.registration.unregister();\r\n    } else if ((res.status === 503 || res.status === 504) && ignoreOfflineError) {\r\n      return null;\r\n    }\r\n    throw new Error(`Manifest fetch failed! (status: ${res.status})`);\r\n  }\r\n  this.lastUpdateCheck = this.adapter.time;\r\n  return res.json();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems counterintuitive, as cache deletion shouldn't occur when the server is offline. Ideally, the service worker should cache the ngsw.json and rely on it, rather than deleting caches when the server experiences downtime. I'm seeking advice on potential solutions to this issue. Should I modify the code to resolve this problem? If so, what changes are recommended to ensure caches are retained even when the server is offline?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51337","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular PWA and offline server\" (#51337)"},{"Id":"1846939171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-11T14:36:48","Actor":"yatho","Number":"51336","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(service-worker): Miss a comma in sample","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Did not touch the pipes in the ToH or Testing folders.\r\n\r\n>The existing, complex discussion of the `CurrencyPipe` within `pipes-transform-data.md` cried out for a new `concurrency-formatting.component` example`.\r\n\r\n**Extracted \"pipe precedence\" into its own page**\r\n\r\nThe topic had been extracted from `pipe.md` and tacked on to the bottom of the `pipes-overview.md` page.\r\n\r\nIt's an advanced and somewhat obscure topic that doesn't belong in the overview. Rather than throw it away, I created a new `pipe-precedence.md` page and added it to the bottom of the pipes section navigation.\r\n\r\nI also tried to improve both the guide text and the companion component, `precedence.component`.\r\n\r\n**How to create a pipe is missing**\r\n\r\nThe readers are told they can create their own pipes in several places throughout the docs. But there are no links and you can't navigate to a page that covers the topic. This is a serious omission!\r\n\r\nThe topic is introduced in the `pipes-custom-data-trans.md` page (extracted verbatim from `pipes.md`). But you can't navigate to this page and their are no links to it.\r\n\r\nTODO: restore this page and add it to the left-nav.\r\n\r\n**Change `pipes.md` references to `pipe-overview.md`**\r\n\r\nThe original, kitchen-sink page, `pipes.md`, was disconnected from navigation long ago, in favor of multiple pages such as `pipe-overview.md`. The page is still in the AIO documentation and can be found by searching or by links from 3rd party documenters. Landing on that page hides the left-nav.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, we treat `pipes.md` as deprecated (which it seems to be). Therefore, this commit retargets previous `pipes.md` references to `pipe-overview.md`.\r\n\r\n>The `change-detection-slow-computations.md` is the exception. It refers to \"pure pipes\", a subject not covered in the current pipe documentation. That reference is retargeted to `api/core/Pipe#pure`.\r\n\r\nCertain code files are only referenced in `pipe.md`. They still work and are displayed in the overall pipes code sample as before.

Time to Interactive (TTI) no longer contributes to the performance score and is not displayed in the report. However, it is still accessible in the Lighthouse result JSON.\n\nWithout TTI, the weighting of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) has increased from 15% to 25%. See the docs for a complete breakdown of [how the Performance score is calculated in 10.0](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10), or [play with the scoring calculator](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/scorecalc/#FCP=3000\\&SI=5800\\&FMP=4000\\&TTI=7300\\&FCI=6500\\&LCP=4000\\&TBT=600\\&CLS=0.25\\&device=mobile\\&version=10\\&version=8).\n\n##### Types for the Node package\n\nLighthouse now includes type declarations! Our [example TypeScript recipe](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/main/docs/recipes/type-checking) demonstrates how to achieve proper type safety with Lighthouse.\n\n##### Third-party Entity classification\n\nSince Lighthouse 5.3, the community-driven [`third-party-web`](https://togithub.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) dataset has been used to summarize how every third-party found on a page contributes to the total JavaScript blocking time, via the `third-party-summary` audit. With Lighthouse 10.0, we are adding a new property to the JSON result (`entities`) to make further use of this dataset. Every origin encountered on a page is now classified as first-party or third-party within `entities`. In 10.0, this classification is used to power the existing third-party filter checkbox.\n\nIn a future version of Lighthouse, this will be used to group the table items of every audit based on the entity it originated from, and aggregate the impact of items from that specific entity.\n\n#### 🆕 New Audits\n\n##### Back/forward cache\n\nThe Back/forward cache (bfcache for short) is a browser optimization that serves pages from fully serialized snapshots when navigating back or forwards in session history. There are over 100 different reasons why a page may not be eligible for this optimization, so to assist developers Lighthouse now attempts to trigger a bfcache response and will list anything that prevented the browser from using the bfcache. [#&#8203;14465](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14465)\n\nFor more on bfcache, see [the web.dev article](https://web.dev/bfcache/).\n\nNote: This audit initially will not be available for PageSpeed Insights.\n\n##### Preventing pasting to inputs\n\nThe audit `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` is now `paste-preventing-inputs`. This audit's logic works just as before, but rather than just considering `[type=password]` inputs, it now fails if *any* non-readonly input element prevents the user from pasting. [#&#8203;14313](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14313)\n\n#### Lighthouse documentation is now on developer.chrome.com\n\nOur documentation is no longer hosted on web.dev. For the most up to date audit docs, please go to [developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)\n\n#### 💥 Breaking changes\n\nUnder the hood, Lighthouse now uses the new user-flow supporting infrastructure by default, even for traditional navigation runs. You can opt out of this by: in the CLI, use `--legacy-navigation`; in DevTools: check “Legacy Navigation” in the settings menu. If you have a use case that necessitates this escape hatch, please file an issue. We plan to remove this legacy path in 11.0.\n\n##### For Lighthouse result JSON (LHR) users\n\n##### Page URLs on the Lighthouse Result\n\nUntil now, there were two URL fields to describe a Lighthouse run:\n\n-   `requestedUrl`: the url given by the users, which Lighthouse instructs Chrome to navigate to\n-   `finalUrl`: the url after any server-initiated HTTP and JS-initiated redirects\n\nThis taxonomy cannot account for more complex scenarios, such as JS-initiated redirects, usage of the History API or soft-navigations. They were also ill-defined for timespan and snapshot modes. To account for that, Lighthouse 10.0 now has these URL fields:\n\n-   (changed) `requestedUrl`: The URL that Lighthouse initially navigated to before redirects. This is the same as it was before for navigation mode, but now it will be `undefined` in timespan/snapshot.\n-   (new) `mainDocumentUrl`: The URL of the last document requested during a navigation. It does not account for soft navigations or history API events made after the page loads. It is only available in navigation mode, and will be undefined in timespan and snapshot modes.\n-   (new) `finalDisplayedUrl`: The URL displayed in the browser combobox at the end of a Lighthouse run. It accounts for soft navigations and history API events. Available in navigation, timespan, and snapshot modes.\n-   (deprecated) `finalUrl`: Same value as `mainDocumentUrl`.\n\n##### Audit changes\n\n-   `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` -> `paste-preventing-inputs`\n-   `preload-lcp-image` -> `prioritize-lcp-image`\n-   `third-party-summary` no longer uses a `link` value for `item.entity`, instead uses a raw `text` value\n-   `full-page-screenshot` is no longer an audit, instead it is stored at `lhr.fullPageScreenshot`. To suppress collection of the full-page screenshot in the CLI, you must migrate from `--skip-audits full-page-screenshot` to `--disable-full-page-screenshot`.\n\n##### For Node users\n\n-   Node 14 is no longer supported, the minimum is now Node 16\n-   In case you import paths within the lighthouse node package: `lighthouse-core/` and `lighthouse-cli/` folders are now simply `core/` and `cli/`\n-   Converted from CommonJS to ES modules. You can still use lighthouse in CommonJS by using an dynamic import: `await import('lighthouse')`. For access to just the `lighthouse` function in CommonJS, you can also use `require('lighthouse/core/index.cjs')`\n-   The CSV output for Lighthouse is much more useful now. Consult the PR for [an example of the new format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13558)\n-   `LHError` is now `LighthouseError`. If you are attempting to catch an error thrown by Lighthouse, be sure to account for this!\n\n##### Node API changes\n\nThe `lighthouse` function now has [better integration with Puppeteer](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/puppeteer.md). Use `lighthouse(url, flags, config, page)` to run Lighthouse, passing an existing `Puppeteer.Page` handle as `page`.\n\nThe user flow api has moved to the top level node entrypoint and can be imported with `import {startFlow} from 'lighthouse'`.\n\nNew `flow.startNavigation()` and `flow.endNavigation()` functions let you define a user triggered navigation without any callback function. See the user flow docs for [an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/user-flows.md#triggering-a-navigation-via-user-interactions).\n\nTo change settings for a single user flow step, define the settings overrides on the toplevel flags options `flow.snapshot({skipAduits: ['uses-http2']})` instead of on the `settingsOverride` property.\n\nTo give a flow step a custom name, use `flow.snapshot({name: 'Custom name'})`. Previously this was done via `stepName`.\n\n##### For Lighthouse customization (custom config, gatherers, audits)\n\n-   To work in Lighthouse 10.0, custom gatherers will need to implement the new Gatherer interface ([an example](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/recipes/custom-audit/memory-gatherer.js)). Otherwise, they will only work in [legacy navigation mode](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#using-legacy-configs-in-100) and older versions of Lighthouse\n-   Lighthouse cannot use `passes` to load the page multiple times in navigation mode anymore. If you need to load the page multiple times, we recommend using a user flow. See our config docs for instructions on [how to convert to the new config format](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#legacy-configs)\n-   The `ScriptElements` artifact is now `Scripts`, with a [slightly different shape](https://togithub.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/955586c4e05d501d69a79d4ef0297991b6805690/types/artifacts.d.ts#L317)\n-   `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails` and `Audit.makeTableDetails` now accept an options object as the third parameter. This ends up being a breaking change for just `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails`.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Since I cannot reopened old issue I've created a new one. That older ticket was closed with a fix that was for a separate issue and the fix was not relevant or helped in anyway.\r\n\r\n### Repro\r\nFollowing simplified code will emit unhandled promise rejection even tho there is a catch handler. This happens only when zone.js is loaded. Without zone.js, all majors browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) don't report anything in this case.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nonunhandledrejection = (e) => { console.log(\"Unhandled promise rejection\", e) }\r\n\r\n(async function() {\r\n    return Promise.reject(1);\r\n})().catch(e => {});\r\n// OR\r\n(async function() {\r\n    await Promise.reject(2);\r\n})().catch(e => {});\r\n```\r\nUsing native Promise.reject will not emit unhandled rejection.\r\n\r\n### Root cause:\r\nzone.js schedules the reporting of unhandled rejections on the microtask queue as soon as the promise is rejected. In the case of `Promise.reject` it schedules as part of the reject call.\r\nJS async function calls `.then` on the returned inner promise (Promise.reject) on the next microtask tick. This is defined in the Ecmascript spec.\r\nzone.js will end up running the code to report unhandled rejections before JS async function has a chance to call `then` and as such zone.js ends emiting unhandled rejection.\r\n\r\nAll major browsers check if unhandled rejections exists at the end of the microtask checkpoint (i.e. after draining the queue) and if needed will schedule on normal queue a task (or what you call a macro task) to process&report unhandled rejections. This allows sufficient time for the async infrastructure to hook to the returned promise. In Chrome and Safari it even allows sufficient time to add catch handler in a callback run by setTimeout of delay 0.\r\n\r\nChrome:\r\nhttps://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/89e00b6b959f5efb4bd7eec468973badb3093a3b/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/scheduler/common/event_loop.cc#L108\r\nhttps://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/89e00b6b959f5efb4bd7eec468973badb3093a3b/third_party/blink/renderer/bindings/core/v8/rejected_promises.cc#L248-L252\r\nFirefox:\r\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/77dd6aa3810610949a5ff925e24de2f8c11377fd/xpcom/base/CycleCollectedJSContext.cpp#L473-L480\r\nSafari:\r\nhttps://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/75a3eb3a5fe3dce1867d880faf785137963b234a/Source/WebCore/dom/Microtasks.cpp#L107\r\nhttps://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/75a3eb3a5fe3dce1867d880faf785137963b234a/Source/WebCore/dom/RejectedPromiseTracker.cpp#L142-L144\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nUnhandled Promise rejection: 1 ; Zone: <root> ; Task: null ; Value: 1 undefined\r\nUnhandled Promise rejection: 2 ; Zone: <root> ; Task: null ; Value: 2 undefined\r\nUnhandled promise rejection PromiseRejectionEvent {isTrusted: true,  reason: 1, type: 'unhandledrejection' ...}\r\nUncaught (in promise) 1\r\nUnhandled promise rejection PromiseRejectionEvent {isTrusted: true,  reason: 2, type: 'unhandledrejection' ...}\r\nUncaught (in promise) 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51328","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"zone.js promises returning Unhandled Promise Rejection error even with catch blocks\" (#51328)"},{"Id":"1846021461","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-10T23:39:12","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"51326","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Improve host binding docs","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds the mention of the support of styles/classes/attributes in host bindings.\r\n\r\nfixes #44296","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51326","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: Improve host binding docs\" (#51326)"},{"Id":"1845549483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-10T16:50:29","Actor":"codedread","Number":"51324","RawContent":null,"Title":"Quick doc fixes","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It work, but as the last time, it still have flick. I try to revert everything, event use the deleted angular/core package but it still flick. \r\n- I decided to do native render instead of using library and get error.\r\n- try to debug it and get this value is true, while I think it should not be this boolean value.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/16970990/ce45a5a2-3acd-4f93-8431-76bd22f8f1b2)\r\n- the lView variable here looks like have an unexpected item which have boolean value. \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/16970990/35785ee7-b570-41b7-b87e-558ef9e4ab24)\r\n- the clue lead to this function, some how it not working.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/16970990/5ef0f45c-b832-4ffd-8a96-8054f82ab6c0)\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\n1. So the question is, at which condition something I code become boolean value? If I can answer that. maybe I can track the real html or ts code I wrote have transform to boolean and I can make a reproduce repository. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think that all. After that I will try it again and see the reason why it still flicks on dynamic render.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n I try to reproduce it but I get

However, that reordering accidentally broke the behavior of the `baseURL` field from `tsconfig.json`. This release moves these path resolution rules around again in an attempt to allow both of these cases to work.\n\n-   Parse TypeScript type arguments for JavaScript decorators ([#&#8203;3308](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3308))\n\n    When parsing JavaScript decorators in TypeScript (i.e. with `experimentalDecorators` disabled), esbuild previously didn't parse type arguments. Type arguments will now be parsed starting with this release. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    @&#8203;foo<number>\n    @&#8203;bar<number, string>()\n    class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix glob patterns matching extra stuff at the end ([#&#8203;3306](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3306))\n\n    Previously glob patterns such as `./*.js` would incorrectly behave like `./*.js*` during path matching (also matching `.js.map` files, for example). This was never intentional behavior, and has now been fixed.\n\n-   Change the permissions of esbuild's generated output files ([#&#8203;3285](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3285))\n\n    This release changes the permissions of the output files that esbuild generates to align with the default behavior of node's [`fs.writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options) function. Since most tools written in JavaScript use `fs.writeFileSync`, this should make esbuild more consistent with how other JavaScript build tools behave.\n\n    The full Unix-y details: Unix permissions use three-digit octal notation where the three digits mean \"user, group, other\" in that order. Within a digit, 4 means \"read\" and 2 means \"write\" and 1 means \"execute\". So 6 == 4 + 2 == read + write. Previously esbuild uses 0644 permissions (the leading 0 means octal notation) but the permissions for `fs.writeFileSync` defaults to 0666, so esbuild will now use 0666 permissions. This does not necessarily mean that the files esbuild generates will end up having 0666 permissions, however, as there is another Unix feature called \"umask\" where the operating system masks out some of these bits. If your umask is set to 0022 then the generated files will have 0644 permissions, and if your umask is set to 0002 then the generated files will have 0664 permissions.\n\n-   Fix a subtle CSS ordering issue with `@import` and `@layer`\n\n    With this release, esbuild may now introduce additional `@layer` rules when bundling CSS to better preserve the layer ordering of the input code. Here's an example of an edge case where this matters:\n\n    ```css\n    /* entry.css */\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"b.css\";\n    @&#8203;import \"a.css\";\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This CSS should set the body background to `green`, which is what happens in the browser. Previously esbuild generated the following output which incorrectly sets the body background to `red`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This difference in behavior is because the browser evaluates `a.css` + `b.css` + `a.css` (in CSS, each `@import` is replaced with a copy of the imported file) while esbuild was only writing out `b.css` + `a.css`. The first copy of `a.css` wasn't being written out by esbuild for two reasons: 1) bundlers care about code size and try to avoid emitting duplicate CSS and 2) when there are multiple copies of a CSS file, normally only the *last* copy matters since the last declaration with equal specificity wins in CSS.\n\n    However, `@layer` was recently added to CSS and for `@layer` the *first* copy matters because layers are ordered using their first location in source code order. This introduction of `@layer` means esbuild needs to change its bundling algorithm. An easy solution would be for esbuild to write out `a.css` twice, but that would be inefficient. So what I'm going to try to have esbuild do with this release is to write out an abbreviated form of the first copy of a CSS file that only includes the `@layer` information, and then still only write out the full CSS file once for the last copy. So esbuild's output for this edge case now looks like this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a;\n\n    /* b.css */\n    @&#8203;layer b {\n      body {\n        background: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* a.css */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      body {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The behavior of the bundled CSS now matches the behavior of the unbundled CSS. You may be wondering why esbuild doesn't just write out `a.css` first followed by `b.css`. That would work in this case but it doesn't work in general because for any rules outside of a `@layer` rule, the last copy shold still win instead of the first copy.\n\n-   Fix a bug with esbuild's TypeScript type definitions ([#&#8203;3299](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3299))\n\n    This release fixes a copy/paste error with the TypeScript type definitions for esbuild's JS API:\n\n    ```diff\n     export interface TsconfigRaw {\n       compilerOptions?: {\n    -    baseUrl?: boolean\n    +    baseUrl?: string\n         ...\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;privatenumber](https://togithub.com/privatenumber).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.47.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.47.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.46.0...v8.47.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`53d7508`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/53d750800b1c0c1f8c29393c488bb3167bb1d2a5) feat: update regex for methods with `thisArg` ([#&#8203;17439](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17439)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`631648e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/631648ee0b51a8951ce576ccd4430e09c9c8bcae) fix: do not report on shadowed constructors in `no-new-wrappers` ([#&#8203;17447](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17447)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`a766a48`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a766a48030d4359db76523d5b413d6332130e485) docs: document lack of config file names ([#&#8203;17442](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17442)) (James)\n-   [`a1635d6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a1635d6198a8baf6571b3351e098e5ac960be887) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`47a0859`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/47a08597966651975126dd6726939cd34f13b80e) docs: update `require-unicode-regexp.md` as following up [#&#8203;17402](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17402) ([#&#8203;17441](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17441)) (SUZUKI Sosuke)\n-   [`fcdc85d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/fcdc85d3a6bc14970c3349cc8d6f3a47eca172a3) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2a92b6c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2a92b6cc9520a27255520369206556e9841a3af8) docs: update with \"Specifying Parser Options\" ([#&#8203;17435](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17435)) (Cheol-Won)\n-   [`d743ed3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/d743ed3c06c62a639da0389ad27907b324ea1715) docs: add metadata for parser/processor ([#&#8203;17438](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17438)) (Huáng Jùnliàng)\n-   [`224376c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/224376cd99a08394291a9584ad9c1ea1283673c6) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`a41a8e4`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a41a8e4a7da14726d6fce71a023f12101fd52fdb) docs: update script names in README ([#&#8203;17432](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17432)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`bf69aa6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/bf69aa6408f5403a88d8c9b71b0e58232b1ea833) chore: Update dependencies ([#&#8203;17456](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17456)) (Nicholas C.

I've added tests to cover these error cases as well as the expected cases.\r\n\r\nI'm introducing the APIs as private in this PR, but will do a followup once they have M2 theme support to make them public.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27617","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add API for custom component theming with M3\" (#27617)"},{"Id":"1844067632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-09T21:48:02","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"27615","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v16.1.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"16.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27615","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v16.1.8 release\" (#27615)"},{"Id":"1844064115","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-09T21:45:01","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"27614","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.1.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27614","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.1.8\" with changelog.\" (#27614)"},{"Id":"1843924463","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-09T20:02:11","Actor":"brian-weasner","Number":"27613","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-progress-bar): Progress Bar alignment issues with text-align css.

The user can select a date/week/month and a more extensive calendar view is opened/updated on the page to for the specific day / week / month. We're using FullCalendar for the extensive calendar view.\r\n- It would be awesome if the MatCalendar could display indicators, for example that a specific date (August 9) has 3 events on this day. Or that the specific date (August 10) has 10 events on this day.\r\n\r\n### Visual example of what could be achieved\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/18558584/65a84681-d663-49cb-8264-81ded789c082)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/18558584/63ef573d-3a82-4a40-a82a-0bf7146bcf93)\r\n\r\n### Reasoning\r\n- Using the dateClass input, I can somewhat achieve a similar thing. I can have an array / map of events, then when rendering the calendar I can match each cell to a list of events, then change the css class accordingly.\r\n  - But the css class is not enough to show dynamic content, such as a text, a specific matTooltip, a specific callback when the cell is hovered, etc.\r\n  - I've seem some hacks floating around that involve replacing the aria-label attribute and then adding a css class that styles the aria-label, but it seems very dirty and non flexible.\r\n- Also, this technique does not \"refresh\" when changing date or if new data is available and should be shown, we have to either:\r\n  - Call `matCalendar.updateTodaysDate()` to force a refresh, even though the date may not really have been changed...\r\n  - Call `matCalendar['_getCurrentViewComponent']()['_init']()` to force a refresh, digging in the code to find private methods that seems to do what we intend to do (refresh each cells based on current dataSet).\r\n\r\n### Feature request\r\n\r\n#### If achievable currently, more documentation\r\n- If what I'm trying to explain is available using renderer and dateClass, I would love to see an example or an explaination of how to do so.\r\n\r\n#### If not achieveable currently\r\n##### Provide data\r\n- The calendar could allow the user to provide, in a way, an array of data or an observable of data associated to specific dates.\r\n- Similar to the dateClass method, a method could be provided to configure how the cell should be rendered depending on the matching provided data.\r\n- Custom components or a very generic component could be configured to map how a specific dataset should behave and be displayed in the context of a cell that has matching data.\r\n  - In my use case, for example, a colored dot that opens an Overlay Panel with details about the hovered day.\r\n\r\n##### Customize each cell view\r\n- The calendar could \"simply\" call a specific method on each cell render, just like the dateClass does.\r\n- The callback could allow us to configure the cell, its hover behavior, tooltip, dom elements that should be displayed under the day number, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nSimple use case, only visual\r\n1. I display the Angular MatCalendar\r\n2. User navigates to December and sees each day of December\r\n3. The 25th is a special day, it has a red dot under the \"25\" to indicate it is a busy day\r\n\r\nSimple use case, different visual\r\n1. I display the Angular MatCalendar\r\n2. User navigates to December and sees each day of December\r\n3. The 25th is a special day, it has a santa hat icon under the \"25\" to indicate it's christmas.\r\n\r\nSimple use case, different visual\r\n1. I display the Angular MatCalendar\r\n2.

User navigates to December and sees each day of December\r\n3. The 25th is a special day, it has a red dot to indicate it is a busy day.

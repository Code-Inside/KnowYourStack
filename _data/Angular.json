Originally, the language service was planning to add support for \"get references\" post the Ivy migration. However, due to a lack of engineering resources available to commit to this migration and a resurgence of community interest in this feature, we have recently landed support for TS references from Angular templates (#37437).\r\n\r\nI think we should _try_ to make this feature more powerful, since template->TS references are maybe 10% of use cases (before the mentioned commit, this was already doable by getting a definition and searching for TS references). At the same time, we don't want to invest too much time in our solutions, as it will eventually get scrapped (even if that \"eventually\" has no deadline). So, I suggest we constrain solutions for \"get references\" as\r\n\r\n- Relatively simple, even if this leads to a less-performant solution. Today's language service already has some very large performance bottlenecks; its unlikely that a very performant \"get references\" will overcome the tail-end costs of parsing, analyzing modules, etc.\r\n\r\n- Focused first on the 90% use cases\r\n\r\nOkay, so in some order of priority combined from the two ideas above, here are my suggestions for how we _might_ be able to implement \"get references\":\r\n\r\n## Case 1: Ng->TS references\r\n\r\nThis is already done by #37437. The idea is trivial - we get the TS definition for an Ng symbol and then defer searching for other TS symbols using a TS language service.\r\n\r\n## Case 2: TS->Ng references\r\n\r\n### Case 2.1: Component members\r\n\r\nThis is also straightforward. As Ng symbols, component members can only be used in the template that belongs to the component. So we just walk the Ast and record everytime we hit a usage of the symbol.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit smarter way to do this that also gives us for free information about whether the reference is in a string (a reference entry can be augmented with this information): first we grep the template for occurences of the symbol, and then descend into only the relevant Ast branches to validate the symbol. If the symbol is not a valid reference, then it's a reference in a string.\r\n\r\n### Case 2.x: Directive members->template, Directive/Component selectors->template, ...\r\n\r\nHere is where it gets tricky. Okay, so first we need to find all NgModules a directive/component is in; this is solved when we analyze NgModules.\r\n\r\nNext we need to find all the templates the directive/component is being used in. We don't know we've found a usage until we parse a template, so we need to construct a set of template files to search. This can be done in two levels:\r\n\r\n1. Include only files of NgModules that import the relevant directive\r\n\r\n2. Use the same grep trick as in 2.1 to prune files that definitely don't have a usage\r\n\r\nAfter this we parse each file and walk it to find references of the Angular item.\r\n\r\nNeeds feedback:\r\n\r\n- Can we be smarter about the searching?\r\n- Grepping can time-consuming and can start falling into the \"very complicated\" category. For example, matching a selector like `form[a][b].a.b` requires matching 16 different combinations. Here a heuristic could be put in place.\r\n\r\n* Note: this section also applies to inputs, outputs, pipes, etc. For inputs/outputs we first find references to the enclosing directive and then search for the input/output. Pipes are imported just like directives and their \"selector\" is the pipe name.\r\n\r\n### Case 3: Ng->Ng references\r\n\r\nThis only applies to references, and is localized to exactly one Ng template file. Thus the implementation can be identical to Case 2.1\r\n\r\nRequesting review: @kyliau ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37496","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"Get References\" in the Angular LS\" (#37496)"},{"Id":"635033386","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T01:09:50","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"37495","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: remove wombot proxy registry from package.jsons for release (#37378)\"","State":"open","Body":"This reverts commit 26849ca99dcafc45fb8cb0e97af7aeb85ea11852.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is safe to do as the underlying issue with npm rate limiting has been resolved.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37495","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Revert \"build: remove wombot proxy registry from package.jsons for release (#37378)\"\" (#37495)"},{"Id":"634988897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T00:23:23","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"37494","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Improve signature selection by finding exact match","State":"closed","Body":"The function signature selection algorithm is totally naive.

This could also be already fixed in an upcoming patch (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37382#issuecomment-637854045), if I am not reading too much into the part about re-enabling tsickle.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the linked issue https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30586#issuecomment-494898597, this only happens when `emitDecoratorMetadata` is enabled. Also, when building the library the compiler throws an error with `strictMetadataEmit` enabled. With the current library schematic you have to change both defaults to reproduce the runtime error.\r\n\r\nThe mentioned defaults are in place since https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/6b28d3ac51f226f6f7fc6065de9d5f2db72302d1 for `emitDecoratorMetadata` and at least since https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/44086c60ff1d6c26d30850bef125120f6c498ac1#diff-5c9bd7887460d6be81e59d58f93ec849 for `strictMetadataEmit`.\r\n\r\nI don't know how common the use cases for enabling `emitDecoratorMetadata` in the current state are or how many older libraries just never changed this option, so I am not sure how common this issue is. I got here via https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/issues/773, but I don't know of other popular libraries having the same problem.\r\n\r\nIf documentation of the issue makes more sense than supporting this in version 9, I am happy to provide a PR for the docs.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to close this issue, if I am only telling you things you already know :slightly_smiling_face:\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction \r\nSee [Repo](https://github.com/JohannesHuster/decorator-metadata-error). I have added the dist folder, in case you don't even need to pull the repo that way.\r\n\r\n- `ng build my-lib --prod`\r\n- `ng run my-app:serve-ssr` (Same behavior with `-c production`)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction of the repo above\r\n\r\n- `ng new my-workspace`\r\n- `ng g library my-lib`\r\n- `ng g application my-app`\r\n- `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject my-app`\r\n- Apply something like https://github.com/JohannesHuster/decorator-metadata-error/commit/713fc1e46225cbb4b74759a6308e40c9f25ad43a\r\n- Apply https://github.com/JohannesHuster/decorator-metadata-error/commit/3d6ad423d66476aa0b4233bc2b7b7a1147d0ebd9\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:140435\r\n    Object(tslib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"__metadata\"])(\"design:paramtypes\", [Document])\r\n                                                                                   ^\r\n\r\nReferenceError: Document is not defined\r\n    at Module.../../node_modules/my-lib-published/__ivy_ngcc__/fesm2015/my-lib.js (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:140435:84)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Object../src/app/app.component.ts (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:161543:12)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Object../src/app/app.module.ts (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:161909:25)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Object../src/app/app.server.module.ts (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:161949:22)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n    at Object../src/main.server.ts (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:162019:27)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (.../dist/my-app/server/main.js:20:30)\r\n\r\nA server error has occurred.\r\nnode exited with 1 code.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.7\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.7\r\n@angular/cli                       9.1.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.7\r\n@nguniversal/builders              9.1.1\r\n@nguniversal/common                9.1.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine        9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.7\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.7\r\nng-packagr                         9.1.5\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I connect the device, accept the debugging authorization and every 20 minutes it disconnects alone, thus popping up again to accept authorization. I debug the apps with livereload, I use the ionic 4 framework. Does anyone know why that happens? Some time ago this was working correctly but I don't know if it's an adb problem or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nI use the Ionic Framework with version 4, but this happens to me with any version,\r\n1.

I launch my application with the command:\r\nionic cordova run android --livereload --consolelogs.\r\n\r\n6. I open the chrome bug to debug my app and see the logs.\r\n\r\n7. When 20 minutes have passed, the authorization popup reappears on the device and I get the following error in the DevTools console\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[WDS] Disconnected!\r\nclose @ vendor.js:137905\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\r\nsockjs-node/info?t=1590993683214\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nIonic:\r\n   Ionic CLI                     : 5.4.9 (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/ionic)\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic/angular 5.1.1\r\n   @angular-devkit/build-angular : 0.803.26\r\n   @angular-devkit/schematics    : 8.3.26\r\n   @angular/cli                  : 8.3.26\r\n   @ionic/angular-toolkit        : 2.2.0\r\n\r\nCordova:\r\n\r\n   Cordova CLI       : 9.0.0 (cordova-lib@9.0.1)\r\n   Cordova Platforms : android 8.1.0\r\n   Cordova Plugins   : cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard 2.2.0, cordova-plugin-ionic-webview 4.2.1, (and 13 other plugins)\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res : 0.11.0 (update available: 0.14.0)\r\n   native-run  : 0.2.9 (update available: 1.0.0)\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   Android SDK Tools : 26.1.1 (/Users/achacon/Library/Android/sdk)\r\n   ios-deploy        : 1.10.0\r\n   ios-sim           : 8.0.2\r\n   NodeJS            : v10.16.3 (/usr/local/bin/node)\r\n   npm               : 6.13.6\r\n   OS                : macOS Catalina\r\n   Xcode             : Xcode 11.4.1 Build version 11E503a\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This has the downside of retaining these tokens at runtime\r\nbecause they are used for dependency injection as values.\r\n\r\nWe can improve this by using so-called light-weight tokens. These allow\r\nus to continue injecting parent list or nav-lists, but without the risk of\r\nretaining the `MatList` and `MatNavList` classes with their factories.\r\n\r\nThis was already the case before Angular v9 with View Engine, but\r\nthe problem became significantly **worse** with Ivy, where factories are now\r\ndirectly attached to the classes (such as `MatList` or `MatNavList`).\r\n\r\nUsing light-weight tokens avoids this issue and gives us an additional\r\nsize improvement. Notably this won't be an improvement when an\r\napplication uses both the nav-list and standard `MatList`.\r\n\r\nRelated to angular/angular-cli#16866.

The test app will create 3 default tabs. If you add enough tabs so that there is just enough space to show the tabs without the tab pagination controls being displayed (based on your screen width), then open the sidenav by clicking the Toggle Sidenav button, the pagination controls do not appear in the tab control. Clicking the Add Tab button to add one more tab will force the tab control to reevaluate the horizontal space and then display the pagination controls for the tab control. \r\n\r\nIt appears that that the tab control is not aware that the horizontal space has decreased, because the sidenav is open, and does not show the pagination controls.

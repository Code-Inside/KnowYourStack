The changes here will be the base for implementing the `on viewport` and `on hover` triggers as well. Includes the following commits:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): extract deferred block trigger information\r\nReworks the compiler to use the API introduced in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51816 to match triggers to the element nodes they point to. This will be used to generate the new instructions for `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement final instruction generation for interaction triggers\r\nUpdates the logic that generates the instructions for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers to their final shape. Now the instructions take two arguments:\r\n1. `triggerIndex` - index at which to find the trigger in the view where it will be rendered.\r\n2. `walkUpTimes` - tells the runtime how many views up it needs to go to find the trigger element. If the argument is omitted, it means that the trigger is in the same view as the deferred block. A positive number means that the runtime needs to go up X amount of times to find the trigger. A negative number means that the trigger is inside the root view of the placeholder block. Negative numbers are capped at -1 since the placeholder is always in the same position at runtime.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add event manager for deferred blocks\r\nAdds an environment-level injectable that keeps track of the events related to `defer` blocks. Currently it only manages the events for `interaction` triggers, but we'll use it for `viewport` and `hover` as well.\r\n\r\n### feat(core): implement deferred block interaction triggers\r\nAdds the implementation for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51830","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Implement deferred interaction triggers\" (#51830)"},{"Id":"1903565298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-19T18:59:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"51827","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose the ViewTransition object created during Router navigation","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nrouter\n\n### Description\n\nEnabling view transitions in the Router using `withViewTransitions` allows developers to easily opt in to animating navigations between pages in the application. Under the hood, the Router calls `document.startViewTransition` but does not make the `ViewTransition` object that is returned from the function available in the public API. This means that skipping a transition with [skipTransition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/skipTransition) or applying and removing styles when the transition is [finished](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/finished) is not possible/difficult.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExpose the `ViewTransition` in some way in the public API. This may not need to be the `ViewTransition` object itself. For example, the different states of the view transition in the react [useViewTransitions](https://github.com/noamr/use-view-transitions/blob/main/src/react-vt.ts#L113) are exposed through `transitionState` and managed internally. To keep things similarly a bit more locked down/hidden, the transition state could be exposed as a `signal` in Angular.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- use timeouts to guess when the transition is finished / update callback is done\r\n- skip transitions by applying CSS class to the HTML which disable the animation and then removing the class before the next transition\r\n- attempt to call `startViewTransition` at the right time without turning on the Router feature","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose the ViewTransition object created during Router navigation\" (#51827)"},{"Id":"1903469549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-19T17:51:14","Actor":"atscott","Number":"51826","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): Remove deprecated setupTestingRouter function","State":"open","Body":"The `setupTestingRouter` function is a factory function for creating a new instance of the `Router`.

The majority of the changes is around reworking the `R3TargetBinder` to consider `if`, `switch` and `defer` blocks (plus the sub-blocks) as separate embedded views. This allows us to properly resolve references within their scope and is consistent with how they behave at runtime. Split up across the following commits to make it easier to review:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): require a reference in interaction and hover triggers\r\nUpdates the parsing for `interaction` and `hover` triggers to require a reference to an element.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): update binder to account for new semantics\r\nWhen the `TargetBinder` was written, the only embedded-view-based nodes were templates, but now we have `{#if}`, `{#switch}` and `{#defer}` which have similar semantics. These changes rework the binder to account for the new nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): add utility to resolve the deferred block trigger element\r\nAdds a utility to the `BoundTarget` that helps with resolving which element a deferred block is pointing to.

However, when working with server-rendered responses, it introduces a noticeable flickering effect. Here's what happens: when server-side rendering (SSR) is enabled and the client receives a server-rendered markup, the browser starts rendering the page on the client side.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the Angular bundles are downloaded on the client. If we're using the router with `withViewTransitions`, the View Transition is applied. This transition aims to switch from the view painted using the SSR response to the view painted by the client app. Since both views are essentially the same, it results in an unwanted flickering effect. Even with the default cross-fade view transition, we observe the same page fading out and then fading back in, contributing to the flickering issue.\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular 17.0.0-next.4\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51815","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add option to skip the initial view transition to avoid flicker-like appearance of initial content render\" (#51815)"},{"Id":"1900864891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-18T13:37:17","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"51813","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): ensure reactive node constants are considered pure (#â€¦","State":"closed","Body":"This is 16.2.x version of PR #51809\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51813","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): ensure reactive node constants are considered pure (#â€¦\" (#51813)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1905981138","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T02:37:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25881","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): initial support for application Web Worker discovery with esbuild","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based builders (`application`/`browser-esbuild`), Web Workers following the previously\r\nsupported syntax as used in the Webpack-based builder will now be discovered.

The initial implementation is still experimental and lacks a lot of features, but it is sufficient to run tests generated by `ng new`.\r\n\r\nThere's no docs or setup instructions yet, however the main path to trying this out is to replace `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in `angular.json`. Since Web Test Runner is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Karma, options should mostly align. Currently only a couple options are actually supported right now, but more will be added over time.\r\n\r\nThe commit messages go more in detail on the implementation. In particular, Web Test Runner integration is done via a custom HTML page which explicitly loads the user's JavaScript in a very particular order. This allows our custom Jasmine integration, sets up Zone.js to patch those symbols correctly, configures `TestBed`, and then runs the user's tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently some unrelated unit tests appear to be failing due to Web Test Runner pulling in `@types/mocha` which is conflicting with `@types/jasmine`. I'm looking into the proper fix for that.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25860","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial Web Test Runner Implementation\" (#25860)"},{"Id":"1899073535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T21:02:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25859","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based application build system through either the `application` or `browser-esbuild` builder, the `localize` option will now allow inlining project defined localizations. The process to configure and enable the i18n system is the same as with the Webpack-based `browser` builder. The implementation uses a similar approach to the `browser` builder in which the application is built once and then post-processed for each active locale. In addition to inlining translations, the locale identifier is injected and the locale specific data is added to the applications. Currently, this implementation adds all the locale specific data to each application during the initial building. While this may cause a small increase in the polyfills bundle (locale data is very small in size), it has a benefit of faster builds and a significantly less complicated build process. Additional size optimizations to the data itself are also being considered to even further reduce impact. Also, with the eventual shift towards the standard `Intl` web APIs, the need for the locale data will become obsolete in addition to the build time code necessary to add it to the application.\r\nWhile build capabilities are functional, there are several areas which have not yet been fully implemented but will be in future changes. These include console progress information, efficient watch support, and app-shell/service worker support.\r\nSSR, pre-rending and app-shell support will be added in followup PRs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25859","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder\" (#25859)"},{"Id":"1898864251","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T20:12:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25858","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis is to align with the `serviceWorker` option.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25858","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option\" (#25858)"},{"Id":"1898129588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T19:01:36","Actor":"Athorcis","Number":"25852","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): fix recursion in webpack resolve","State":"closed","Body":"fix a recursion in webpack resolve when resolving absolute paths on windows\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So it \"scrolls\" with it so to say.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.x\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2 - actual\r\n- Browser(s): CHROME\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27794","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Drag object if page is scrolling\" (#27794)"},{"Id":"1898752871","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T16:33:38","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"27797","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/button): switch flat-button to density tokens","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/button): switch flat-button to density tokens\" (#27797)"},{"Id":"1898496908","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T14:02:51","Actor":"AlexanderMelde","Number":"27796","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/badge): automatically set aria-hidden","State":"open","Body":"This PR solves issue #27705 by automatically setting `aria-hidden=true` if mat-icons have a visible badge. \r\n\r\nPreviously, badges on mat-icons caused a warning, instructing the developer to set this attribute appropriately.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27796","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/badge): automatically set aria-hidden\" (#27796)"},{"Id":"1895925914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-14T11:47:29","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27792","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 5.2 and Angular 17","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the repo to TS 5.2 and Angular 17.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27792","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to TypeScript 5.2 and Angular 17\" (#27792)"},{"Id":"1896151991","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-14T09:29:52","Actor":"noguespi","Number":"27793","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(MatDateRangePicker): Add selection event","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAdd the ability to be notified when the date range selection change but is not yet applied.\r\n\r\nThe _dateChange_ output of MatDatepickerInput is not a solution because it notify once the range changed AND applied.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the outputs _monthSelected_ or _yearSelected_ we already have, it could be _rangeSelected_.\r\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nA use case for this is would be to preview the current range selection.\r\n\r\nFor example, because the datepicker it is not a double calendar (like the one in #20613), it is difficult to see when the range starts or end when it spread over several months.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1118107/b2e7f5dd-2596-4ca2-8a94-b28344ffb008)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the hack I found is to override the DefaultMatCalendarRangeStrategy with an observable that I reinject in my component to be notified when the range change.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatDateRangePicker): Add selection event\" (#27793)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-09-21T03:30:03.3196045Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1979}

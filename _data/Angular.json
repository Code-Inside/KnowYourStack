There are some users, like myself that find it a little messier looking, specifically the extra indentation, and braces. It makes it look more of a jumble of html and JS. I think a lot of users liked the fact that the templates looked like plain html using the old *ng directives. I understand the old syntax is still available. A solution would add an alternate short hand control flow  that utilizes html's existing indentation and block scope ( open/close tag). This will be most useful for small control flow one liners. \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis proposal does not change existing control flow. It adds a shorthand alternative. It allows control flow @ syntax to be used in html tags, and scope is determined by the tags open/close tags. \r\n \r\n  ``` \r\n<div @if(person1)>{{person1.name}}, {{person1.name}}</div>\r\n<div @if(person2)>{{person2.name}}, {{person2.name}}</div>\r\n<div @if(person3)>{{person3.name}}, {{person3.name}}</div>\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively use the old syntax\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (person1) {\r\n  <div>{{person1.name}}, {{person1.name}}</div>\r\n}\r\n@if (person2) {\r\n  <div>{{person2.name}}, {{person2.name}}</div>\r\n}\r\n@if (person3) {\r\n  <div>{{person3.name}}, {{person3.name}}</div>\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57646","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Suggestion: Shorthand Control Flow\" (#57646)"},{"Id":"2503366104","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T16:58:10","Actor":"yurakis","Number":"57644","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generic types of components/directives are inferred as `any` when some corresponding inputs are omitted","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI recently started to notice that after introducing `strictTemplates` and `strictNullChecks` in my project, WebStorm still sometimes highlights types incompatibility. So I started investigating whether it's my IDE's problem or not.\r\n\r\nLet's assume that we have a method in component, which accepts string as an argument. If we try to call it from a template with `undefined` or `null` explicitly, compiler would throw an error. However, this is not the case when library is involved. In my example [<mat-calendar>](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/api#MatCalendar) is used along with `(selectedChange)`.\r\n\r\n`$event` can be null. And if I try to call that method with `$event.toString()`, compiler would not complain. Even something like `$event?.toString()` or `$event?.toString() ?? undefined` or `$event?.toString() || undefined` would still be fine for the compiler. At the same time something like `'' || undefined` will trigger a compilation error.\r\n\r\nHere is the StackBlitz [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/4yhgc4?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdatepicker-inline-calendar-example.html). This is a fork from the [official example](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview#using-mat-calendar-inline).\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- init strict application with `strictTemplates` & `strictNullChecks`\r\n- create component with a method, which accepts string as a single argument\r\n- call that method from the template using third-party library's component where `$event` can be `null`. E.g. `myMethod($event.toString())`\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThis is what I would actually expect to see in such case, but no error was given.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57644","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generic types of components/directives are inferred as `any` when some corresponding inputs are omitted\" (#57644)"},{"Id":"2503351202","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T16:55:45","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57643","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Add a schematics to migrate to `standalone: false`.","State":"open","Body":"With the framework enabling `standalone` by default (making module based an opt-in), the migration will migrate none-standalone existing components and add `standalone: false` to the decorator.\r\n\r\nThe migration will also remove `standalone: true` properties as they are now not necessary anymore","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57643","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): Add a schematics to migrate to `standalone: false`.\" (#57643)"},{"Id":"2501297223","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T14:55:12","Actor":"devversion","Number":"57629","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): properly handle cases of `--strict=false` in signal input migration","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57629","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(migrations): properly handle cases of `--strict=false` in signal input migration\" (#57629)"},{"Id":"2501925060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T14:52:16","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"57634","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update babel dependencies to v7.25.6","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/cli](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-cli) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-cli)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.24.8` -> `7.25.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcli/7.24.8/7.25.6) |\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.25.5` -> `7.25.6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.25.5/7.25.6) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/cli)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.25.6`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7256-2024-08-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.24.8...v7.25.6)\n\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n-   `babel-generator`\n    -

Specifically, even when two texts contained overlapping passages, `diffWords` would sometimes choose to delete all the words from the old text and insert them anew in their new positions in order to avoid having to delete or insert whitespace tokens. Whitespace sequences are no longer tokens as of this release, which affects both the generated diffs and the `count`s.\n\n    Runs of whitespace are still tokens in `diffWordsWithSpace`.\n\n    As part of the changes to `diffWords`, **a new `.postProcess` method has been added on the base `Diff` type**, which can be overridden in custom `Diff` implementations.\n\n    **`diffLines` with `ignoreWhitespace: true` will no longer ignore the insertion or deletion of entire extra lines of whitespace at the end of the text**. Previously, these would not show up as insertions or deletions, as a side effect of a hack in the base diffing algorithm meant to help ignore whitespace in `diffWords`. More generally, **the undocumented special handling in the core algorithm for ignored terminals has been removed entirely.** (This special case behavior used to rewrite the final two change objects in a scenario where the final change object was an addition or deletion and its `value` was treated as equal to the empty string when compared using the diff object's `.equals` method.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;500](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/500) **`diffChars` now diffs Unicode code points** instead of UTF-16 code units.\n\n-   [#&#8203;508](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/508) **`parsePatch` now always runs in what was previously \"strict\" mode; the undocumented `strict` option has been removed.** Previously, by default, `parsePatch` (and other patch functions that use it under the hood to parse patches) would accept a patch where the line counts in the headers were inconsistent with the actual patch content - e.g. where a hunk started with the header `@@&#8203; -1,3 +1,6 @&#8203;@&#8203;`, indicating that the content below spanned 3 lines in the old file and 6 lines in the new file, but then the actual content below the header consisted of some different number of lines, say 10 lines of context, 5 deletions, and 1 insertion. Actually trying to work with these patches using `applyPatch` or `merge`, however, would produce incorrect results instead of just ignoring the incorrect headers, making this \"feature\" more of a trap than something actually useful. It's been ripped out, and now we are always \"strict\" and will reject patches where the line counts in the headers aren't consistent with the actual patch content.\n\n-   [#&#8203;435](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/435) **Fix `parsePatch` handling of control characters.** `parsePatch` used to interpret various unusual control characters - namely vertical tabs, form feeds, lone carriage returns without a line feed, and EBCDIC NELs - as line breaks when parsing a patch file. This was inconsistent with the behavior of both JsDiff's own `diffLines` method and also the Unix `diff` and `patch` utils, which all simply treat those control characters as ordinary characters. The result of this discrepancy was that some well-formed patches - produced either by `diff` or by JsDiff itself and handled properly by the `patch` util - would be wrongly parsed by `parsePatch`, with the effect that it would disregard the remainder of a hunk after encountering one of these control characters.\n\n-   [#&#8203;439](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/439) **Prefer diffs that order deletions before insertions.** When faced with a choice between two diffs with an equal total edit distance, the Myers diff algorithm generally prefers one that does deletions before insertions rather than insertions before deletions. For instance, when diffing `abcd` against `acbd`, it will prefer a diff that says to delete the `b` and then insert a new `b` after the `c`, over a diff that says to insert a `c` before the `b` and then delete the existing `c`. JsDiff deviated from the published Myers algorithm in a way that led to it having the opposite preference in many cases, including that example. This is now fixed, meaning diffs output by JsDiff will more accurately reflect what the published Myers diff algorithm would output.\n\n-   [#&#8203;455](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/455) **The `added` and `removed` properties of change objects are now guaranteed to be set to a boolean value.** (Previously, they would be set to `undefined` or omitted entirely instead of setting them to false.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;464](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/464) Specifying `{maxEditLength: 0}` now sets a max edit length of 0 instead of no maximum.\n\n-   [#&#8203;460](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/460) **Added `oneChangePerToken` option.**\n\n-   [#&#8203;467](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/467) **Consistent ordering of arguments to `comparator(left, right)`.** Values from the old array will now consistently be passed as the first argument (`left`) and values from the new array as the second argument (`right`). Previously this was almost (but not quite) always the other way round.\n\n-   [#&#8203;480](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/480) **Passing `maxEditLength` to `createPatch` & `createTwoFilesPatch` now works properly** (i.e. returns undefined if the max edit distance is exceeded; previous behavior was to crash with a `TypeError` if the edit distance was exceeded).\n\n-   [#&#8203;486](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/486) **The `ignoreWhitespace` option of `diffLines` behaves more sensibly now.** `value`s in returned change objects now include leading/trailing whitespace even when `ignoreWhitespace` is used, just like how with `ignoreCase` the `value`s still reflect the case of one of the original texts instead of being all-lowercase. `ignoreWhitespace` is also now compatible with `newlineIsToken`. Finally, **`diffTrimmedLines` is deprecated** (and removed from the docs) in favour of using `diffLines` with `ignoreWhitespace: true`; the two are, and always have been, equivalent.\n\n-   [#&#8203;490](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/490) **When calling diffing functions in async mode by passing a `callback` option, the diff result will now be passed as the *first* argument to the callback instead of the second.** (Previously, the first argument was never used at all and would always have value `undefined`.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;489](redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/489) **`this.options` no longer exists on `Diff` objects.** Instead, `options` is now passed as an argument to methods that rely on options, like `equals(left, right, options)`. This fixes a race condition in async mode, where diffing behaviour could be changed mid-execution if a concurrent usage of the same `Diff` instances overwrote its `options`.\n\n-   [#&#8203;518](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/518) **`linedelimiters` no longer exists** on patch objects; instead, when a patch with Windows-style CRLF line endings is parsed, **the lines in `lines` will end with `\\r`**. There is now a **new `autoConvertLineEndings` option, on by default**, which makes it so that when a patch with Windows-style line endings is applied to a source file with Unix style line endings, the patch gets autoconverted to use Unix-style line endings, and when a patch with Unix-style line endings is applied to a source file with Windows-style line endings, it gets autoconverted to use Windows-style line endings.\n\n-   [#&#8203;521](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/521) \\*\\*the `callback` option is now supported by `structuredPatch`, \\`createPatch\n\n-   [#&#8203;529](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/529) **`parsePatch` can now parse patches where lines starting with `--` or `++` are deleted/inserted**; previously, there were edge cases where the parser would choke on valid patches or give wrong results.\n\n-   [#&#8203;530](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/530) **Added `ignoreNewlineAtEof` option`to`diffLines\\`**\n\n-   [#&#8203;533](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/533) **`applyPatch` uses an entirely new algorithm for fuzzy matching.** Differences between the old and new algorithm are as follows:\n    -   The `fuzzFactor` now indicates the maximum [*Levenshtein* distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) that there can be between the context shown in a hunk and the actual file content at a location where we try to apply the hunk. (Previously, it represented a maximum [*Hamming* distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance), meaning that a single insertion or deletion in the source file could stop a hunk from applying even with a high `fuzzFactor`.)\n    -   A hunk containing a deletion can now only be applied in a context where the line to be deleted actually appears verbatim. (Previously, as long as enough context lines in the hunk matched, `applyPatch` would apply the hunk anyway and delete a completely different line.)\n    -   The context line immediately before and immediately after an insertion must match exactly between the hunk and the file for a hunk to apply. (Previously this was not required.)\n\n-   [#&#8203;535](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/535) **A bug in patch generation functions is now fixed** that would sometimes previously cause `\\ No newline at end of file` to appear in the wrong place in the generated patch, resulting in the patch being invalid.\n\n-   [#&#8203;535](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/535) **Passing `newlineIsToken: true` to *patch*-generation functions is no longer allowed.** (Passing it to `diffLines` is still supported - it's only functions like `createPatch` where passing `newlineIsToken` is now an error.) Allowing it to be passed never really made sense, since in cases where the option had any effect on the output at all, the effect tended to be causing a garbled patch to be created that couldn't actually be applied to the source file.\n\n-   [#&#8203;539](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/539) **`diffWords` now takes an optional `intlSegmenter` option** which should be an `Intl.Segmenter` with word-level granularity. This provides better tokenization of text into words than the default behaviour, even for English but especially for some other languages for which the default behaviour is poor.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nOn the [Component Communication with @Input](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/8-input) example from the tutorial, we're presented with an example for passing an `occupation` (`string`) prop with an `Angular Developer` value. But the parent component in the example that will receive the prop includes the statement: \r\n\r\n`The user's name is {{occupation}}`\r\n\r\nWhile doing the tutorial I thought maybe we could re-phrase that so it made a little bit more sense, so I thought about changing it to:\r\n\r\n`The user's occupation is {{occupation}}`\r\n\r\nWhich feels more 'correct'.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe behavior is exactly the same except now the example reads `The user's occupation is {{occupation}}` instead of `The user's name is {{occupation}}`\r\n\r\nNote that while the answer does expect the statement to be `The user's name is {{ name }}`, this changes come _before_ the instructions to follow for that part of the tutorial, this is just the example right before that and it does not modify the answer or the instructions in any case, it's just the previous example.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThank you for your hard work!\r\nBest regards! :heart: ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57625","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(upgrade): change example wording on Input tutorial\" (#57625)"},{"Id":"2502724514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T13:05:00","Actor":"keatkeat87","Number":"57642","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Compiler): incorrect compile when using CSS 4 :not() complex selector","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nbefore compile\r\n\r\n```\r\n::ng-deep input:not(:checked, :focus) ~ p {\r\n  background-color: red;\r\n  color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter compile\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput:not(:checked, [_ngcontent-%COMP%]:focus) ~ p[_ngcontent-%COMP%] {  \r\n  background-color: red;  color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe problem is `[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:focus`, it should be just `input:not(:checked, :focus)`\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/keatkeat87/ng-compiler-css-4-not-selector.git\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57642","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Compiler): incorrect compile when using CSS 4 :not() complex selector\" (#57642)"},{"Id":"2502400570","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T10:24:50","Actor":"RanjanRavi2398","Number":"57641","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: NG0300: Multiple components match node with tagname button: ExcelCommandDirective and MatLegacyButton.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nupgrade\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHey Angular Team, \r\nI am getting error like **Error: NG0300: Multiple components match node with tagname button: ExcelCommandDirective and MatLegacyButton.** while upgrading angular from version 15 to 16.

It has a two components inside it - patients-options-panel and patients-table.\r\nI'm trying to call refreshGrid method with filters of the patients-options-panel inside patients component.\r\n\r\nIt successfully calls that method, but paginator and sort members are undefined. Why? It shoulda been initialized in the parent component - app-table. What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso, using Chrome DevTools I see that we are in the PatientsTableComponent when I click search in options panel. And sort with paginator isn't defined here. This is really upsets me.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\napp-table.component.ts\r\n```ts\r\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, inject, Input, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { SelectionModel } from

This configuration causes every request to go through the static file middleware, including those intended for Angular SSR.\r\n* As a result, some routes can inadvertently serve the `index.html` file or other static assets, leading to incorrect `Content-Type` headers, especially for JavaScript files (e.g., lazy-loaded modules; the `main*.js` and `chunk*.js` files).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0f9744-2440-4f9f-986e-4e3f4b9afa6f)\r\n(I cant show the response, but it's the `index.html` content)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076e746-28cb-489f-ad5e-5e55291668ce)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Lack of Distinction Between Static Files and Angular Routes:**\r\n\r\nRequests that are intended to be handled by Angular’s SSR engine may be incorrectly intercepted by the static file middleware if the requested path contains dots or other file-like patterns. This can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect content delivery.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution:\r\n**1. Static Files Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '**',\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: 'index.html',\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '*.*', // This ensures only files with extensions are served by express.static\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: false, // Do not look for index.html in the browserDistFolder\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. SSR Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\n* Static assets should be served with correct Content-Type headers.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badccd98-83a0-4b3d-a26f-3223472ee1b8)\r\n\r\n* Angular routes should be correctly handled by SSR, regardless of whether they contain dots or other special characters.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n> Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

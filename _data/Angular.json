The NGINX_CSP_NONCE placeholder was added to index.html and app-root, which is replaced at runtime by NGINX. However, after navigating to a new page, styles are no longer applied correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Environment:**\n\n- **Angular Version:** 19\n- **SSR:** Angular/SSR (using @angular/ssr)\n- **CSP Implementation:**\n  - NGINX configuration updated with CSP sub_filter.\n  - `NGINX_CSP_NONCE` placeholder added in `index.html` and `app-root`.\n- **Previous Angular Version:** 15\n\n\n**Expected Behavior:**  \nStyles should remain consistently applied on all pages after navigation.\n\n---\n\n**Actual Behavior:**  \nStyles are correctly applied on the initial page load, but break after navigating to another page.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Information / Questions:**\n\n- Is there a configuration step missing in the SSR setup related to the CSP implementation?\n- Could the issue be due to the dynamic generation of the nonce or its handling in the Angular SSR setup?\n- Are there any known issues or workarounds when combining Angular SSR with CSP using Angular 19?\n\n---\n\n**Attachments:**  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1210b80b-c419-47f1-87ee-abc299743873)\n\n---\n\n \nPlease let me know if any further information is needed to help diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___ \n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | | \n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | | \n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.5        \nNode: 20.18.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.4\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.5\n@angular/cli                    19.2.5\n@angular/ssr                    19.2.5\n@schematics/angular             19.2.5\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60666","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Styles Break on Navigation after Upgrading to Angular 19 with Angular SSR and CSP Configuration\" (#60666)"},{"Id":"2962695718","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-01T08:28:24","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60665","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): replace `first()`","State":"open","Body":"In most cases, we may not even need to use `first()` since it behaves slightly differently, especially when the observable completes without emitting a value (which would throw an error).

In this scenario, the server returns an empty response, but the application works fine for other routes. The issue only occurs when navigating to the redirect route defined in the app.routes.ts configuration.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nClone repo and install npm packages.\n\nConfigure a redirect route in app.routes.ts. (i found a working solution with a redirectGuard, you can switch)\n\nStart the application in SSR mode. (ng serve --no-hmr)\n\nAccess the application via the entry route (root).\n\nThe server returns a blank response instead of properly redirecting.\n\nNavigation to other routes works as expected.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe server should correctly handle the redirect and return the appropriate content or redirect response when accessing the redirect route.\n\nActual Behavior:\nThe server returns a blank or empty response when navigating to the redirect route from the entry point.

Schematics with a custom one by the use of schematicCollections option in angular.json file like for instance:\n\n  \"cli\": { \"analytics\": false, \"schematicCollections\": [ \"./schematics\", \"@schematics/angular\" ] }\n\nAnd create your custom schematics (index.ts):\n\n```TS\nexport function generateComponent(options: ComponentOptions): Rule {\n  console.log('options', structuredClone(options));\n  return (_tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {\n    return externalSchematic(\n      \"@schematics/angular\",\n      \"component\",\n      options\n    );\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd define custom defaults using angular.json file, like for instance:\n```JSON\n  \"cli\": {\n    \"analytics\": false,\n    \"schematicCollections\": [\n      \"./schematics\",\n      \"@schematics/angular\"\n    ]\n  },\n    \"schematics\": {\n    \"@schematics/angular:component\": {\n      \"inlineTemplate\": false,\n      \"inlineStyle\": false,\n      \"style\": \"scss\",\n      \"skipTests\": true\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nYou will notice that your defaults are ignored.\n\nMoreover, in options argument from generateComponent function the values are already parsed by the cli making it impossible to distinguish which ones were provided by the user and which ones by the parser.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nPlease use the attached repo to reproduce the issue:\n\n\nExecute schematics:\n```CLI\nng g c test\n```\n\nOptions values received in generateComponent function: \n\n```TS\noptions {\n  name: 'test',\n  path: undefined,\n  project: 'schematics-test',\n

[`v0.25.2`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0252)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.1...v0.25.2)\n\n-   Support flags in regular expressions for the API ([#&#8203;4121](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4121))\n\n    The JavaScript plugin API for esbuild takes JavaScript regular expression objects for the `filter` option. Internally these are translated into Go regular expressions. However, this translation previously ignored the `flags` property of the regular expression. With this release, esbuild will now translate JavaScript regular expression flags into Go regular expression flags. Specifically the JavaScript regular expression `/\\.[jt]sx?$/i` is turned into the Go regular expression `` `(?i)\\.[jt]sx?$` `` internally inside of esbuild's API. This should make it possible to use JavaScript regular expressions with the `i` flag. Note that JavaScript and Go don't support all of the same regular expression features, so this mapping is only approximate.\n\n-   Fix node-specific annotations for string literal export names ([#&#8203;4100](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4100))\n\n    When node instantiates a CommonJS module, it scans the AST to look for names to expose via ESM named exports. This is a heuristic that looks for certain patterns such as `exports.NAME = ...` or `module.exports = { ... }`. This behavior is used by esbuild to \"annotate\" CommonJS code that was converted from ESM with the original ESM export names. For example, when converting the file `export let foo, bar` from ESM to CommonJS, esbuild appends this to the end of the file:\n\n    ```js\n    // Annotate the CommonJS export names for ESM import in node:\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      bar,\n      foo\n    });\n    ```\n\n    However, this feature previously didn't work correctly for export names that are not valid identifiers, which can be constructed using string literal export names. The generated code contained a syntax error. That problem is fixed in this release:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    let foo\n    export { foo as \"foo!\" }\n\n    // Old output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\"\n    });\n\n    // New output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\": null\n    });\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for index source maps ([#&#8203;3439](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3439), [#&#8203;4109](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4109))\n\n    The source map specification has an optional mode called [index source maps](https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-index-source-map) that makes it easier for tools to create an aggregate JavaScript file by concatenating many smaller JavaScript files with source maps, and then generate an aggregate source map by simply providing the original source maps along with some offset information. My understanding is that this is rarely used in practice. I'm only aware of two uses of it in the wild: [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack/).\n\n    This release provides basic support for indexed source maps. However, the implementation has not been tested on a real app (just on very simple test input). If you are using index source maps in a real app, please try this out and report back if anything isn't working for you.\n\n    Note that this is also not a complete implementation. For example, index source maps technically allows nesting source maps to an arbitrary depth, while esbuild's implementation in this release only supports a single level of nesting. It's unclear whether supporting more than one level of nesting is important or not given the lack of available test cases.\n\n    This feature was contributed by

I have come across Issue #49194, which suggests to use `ngc --noEmit`. This solution seems to work fine, except we are using scss for our styles and this results in errors such as:\r\n```output\r\nCouldn't resolve resource vars_mixins from /path/to/component/some.component.scss\r\n```\r\nThese errors seem to be caused by shorthand imports such as\r\n```scss\r\n@import 'vars_mixins';\r\n```\r\nand can be fixed by using absolute file paths and file extensions. However, this is not an option for style files imported from `node_modules` which will usually include shorthand imports such as the one shown above (e.g. bootstrap).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to work around this issue? It seems that preprocessor options are only defined in `angular.json`, which means I would have to run the preprocessor step manually before running `ngc` to get this working?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIdeally there should be a way to run a simple type check with the angular CLI similar to what tools like [svelte-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-check) achieve.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Type check with `ngc --noEmit` results in scss import errors\" (#50581)"},{"Id":"1742917004","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-06T01:58:39","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"50580","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): use `transform` functions in NgOptimizedImage inputs","State":"open","Body":"This commit refactors the code of NgOptimizedImage directive to switch from getter/setter approach to convert inputs to use the `transform` function instead.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50580","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(common): use `transform` functions in NgOptimizedImage inputs\" (#50580)"},{"Id":"1742409243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-05T19:06:20","Actor":"byvide","Number":"50579","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): add standalone option to descriptions","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

CTRL+U in browser will show SSR did not retrieve the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also made the same repo in angular 15 where SSR is working correctly using basically the same code.\r\nhttps://github.com/echotech11/ssr-problem-15\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo errors\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___ \r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | | \r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | | \r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.4\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.4\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.0.2\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50562","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 16 SSR not retrieving data from http request\" (#50562)"},{"Id":"1738230592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T13:43:09","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50554","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): Prevent a component from importing itself.","State":"open","Body":"This commit fixes the migrations for recursive components.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, the migration was creating a forwardRef to the Component itself. \r\n\r\nfixes #50525\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50554","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(migrations): Prevent a component from importing itself.\" (#50554)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1742221141","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-05T17:27:42","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25318","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add internal support for index HTML link hints","State":"open","Body":"The index HTML generation functionality for both the Webpack-based and esbuild-based browser application builder now supports adding link hint elements to the generated output.

the end saving a report at the root folder (outside of src).\r\nthis report causes reloading, while its not part of the project, and not consumed by any module.\r\n\r\ncan we limit the detected parts to be only from the \"src\" folder?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nng serve\r\ncreate or save a file which is outside of the project, and not consumed by any part of the project.\r\nsee esbuild

Useful when trying to avoid import conflicts.\r\n3. `feat(@schematics/angular): add bootstrap-agnostic utilities for writing ng-add schematics` - This is the commit that adds the two new `addRootImport` and `addRootProvider` utilities that library authors can use.\r\n4. `refactor(@schematics/angular): deprecate private standalone utilities` - Marks the existing private standalone

@alan-agius4 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n// 16.0.3\r\nRun `ng new project-name`    \r\n\r\nUpdate tsconfig.json to\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompilerOptions: {\r\n   \"target\": \"ES2015\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following line of code to AppComponent.ts:\r\n\r\n    person = null ?? { name: 'Simon' };`\r\n\r\nRun `ng serve`\r\n\r\nView `main.js` in browser and observe that the code has been transpiled:\r\n\r\n    this.person = false ? 0 : {\r\n        name: 'Simon'\r\n    };\r\n\r\nWith `target` set to `ES2022` the `??` remains:\r\n\r\n    this.person = null ?? {\r\n        name: 'Simon'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThe code is still being transpiled, despite the warning message telling me it has been up-targeted to ES2022.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 18.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli,

Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24435, but that is related to `useDefineForClassFields` and not `target`.\r\n\r\nSee my answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75047760/typescript-target-warnings-after-angular-15-update/76369523#76369523\r\n\r\nThe main reason this is an issue is because you can observe your user code is transpiled, but Angular / vendor code is not - which may lead to a false sense of security if needing to target older browsers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25290","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Application code is not being 'up-targeted' to ES2022 despite warning message from CLI\"

Hit enter and listen to the entire screen reader output (or check something like Speech Viewer for NVDA)\r\n\r\nNotice the announcement of the entire next week of dates.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpected less verbosity and for only the focused date/cell to be announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently, the entire next week of dates will be announced by the screen reader after the currently focused cell.\r\n\r\nNVDA 2023.1 output (italics indicate unexpected readout):\r\n> Choose a date  dialog\r\n> table\r\n> June 2, 2023  row 3  Friday  column 6\r\n> table  with 7 rows and 7 columns  clickable  row 3  Friday  column 6  June 2, 2023  toggle button  not pressed    current date\r\n> Choose a date\r\n> toggle button  not pressed    current date  June 2, 2023\r\n> _Saturday  column 7  toggle button  not pressed    June 3, 2023_\r\n> _row 4  Sunday  column 1  toggle button  not pressed    June 4, 2023_\r\n> _Monday  column 2  toggle button  not pressed    June 5, 2023_\r\n> _Tuesday  column 3  toggle button  not pressed    June 6, 2023_\r\n> _Wednesday  column 4  toggle button  not pressed    June 7, 2023_\r\n> _Thursday  column 5  toggle button  not pressed    June 8, 2023_\r\n> _Friday  column 6  toggle button  not pressed    June 9, 2023_\r\n> _Saturday  column 7  toggle button  not pressed    June 10, 2023_\r\n> _row 5  Sunday  column 1  toggle button  not pressed    June 11, 2023_\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome (114), Firefox (112) \r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10, Windows 11\r\n- Screen readers: NVDA 2023.1","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): NVDA announces entire week of dates when dialog opens\" (#27228)"},{"Id":"1738662447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T18:55:43","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"27227","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): handle contextmenu events","State":"open","Body":"fixes issue #27225","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27227","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): handle contextmenu events\" (#27227)"},{"Id":"1738622394","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T18:23:28","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"27226","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(slider): Slider doesn't render values in SSR (Universal)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n- When rendered on the server with Angular Universal, the slider thumb always renders at the left-most position, regardless on the actual value\r\n- What's more, a range slider only shows the \"start\" thumb, but not the \"end\" thumb. \n\n### Reproduction\n\n(don't know where to host a Universal app)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- Two thumbs are rendered in SSR for a range slider\r\n- Slider thumbs positions in SSR reflect the actual slider values\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Only the \"start\" thumb is rendered in SSR\r\n- The the start thumb is rendered in the left-most position in SSR, regardless on the actual value\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15\r\n- CDK/Material: 15\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27226","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(slider): Slider doesn't render values in SSR (Universal)\" (#27226)"},{"Id":"1738584201","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T17:52:12","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"27225","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(slider): Right click on a slider makes it permanently focused and unresponsive","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe issue consists of two parts:\r\n- The focus ripple stays forever after a right click.

This widget takes a value as an input and sets it to the form control bound to the slider:\r\n```\r\n// template\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input matSliderThumb [formControl]=\"sliderValue\">\r\n</>\r\n\r\n// component\r\n@Input() value: number\r\n\r\nsliderValue = new FormControl(0, {nonNullable: true})\r\n\r\nngOnChanges() {\r\n  this.sliderValue.setValue(this.value) // <-- this\r\n\r\n  // derived value used in the template\r\n  this.isDefaultValue = this.value === 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the `.setValue` call breaks change detection. The `isDefaultValue` value is properly derived (as per console.log output), but is not reflected in HTML. It will get updated after the next interaction with the widget (which triggers change detection), or after manually calling `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\nThis happens with a single-handle or a two-handle slider.\r\n\r\nIt only happens when the value is bound to the slider via a form control. If I pass the value as a property binding instead (`[value]=\"sliderValue.value\"`), everything works fine.\r\nAlso moving the `isDefaultValue` calculation up to be before the `.setValue` call magically solves it, too.\r\n\r\n![slider-cd](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1004015/476b5b2b-d1dd-4329-9c82-337bbc344dd7)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/xsoedg?file=src%2Fexample%2Fapp-widget.component.ts\r\n1.

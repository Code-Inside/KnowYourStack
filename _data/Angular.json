Let’s create a simple arithmetic library that contains functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers.\n\n1. **Create the header file (`mymath.h`):**\n\n    This file will declare the functions that our library will provide. It’s important to declare the functions with `extern` to ensure that they are available outside the source file. We’ll also include include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the header file.\n\n    \n    // mymath.h\n    #ifndef MYMATH_H\n    #define MYMATH_H\n\n    extern \"C\" {\n        int add(int a, int b);\n        int subtract(int a, int b);\n        int multiply(int a, int b);\n        float divide(int a, int b);\n    }\n\n    #endif\n    \n\n    - `#ifndef MYMATH_H` and `#define MYMATH_H`: These lines ensure that the contents of the file are only included once, even if the header file is included multiple times in other files.\n    - `extern \"C\"`: This is used to disable C++ name mangling when compiling the functions, allowing them to be used with C or other languages.\n    - The functions `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` are declared, but their definitions will be provided in a separate source file.\n\n1. **Create the source file (`mymath.cpp`):**\n\n    This file will define the functions declared in the header file.\n\n    \n    // mymath.cpp\n    #include <stdexcept>\n\n    #include \"mymath.h\"\n\n    int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    int subtract(int a, int b) {\n        return a - b;\n    }\n\n    int multiply(int a, int b) {\n        return a * b;\n    }\n\n    float divide(int a, int b) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Division by zero\");\n        }\n\n        return static_cast<float>(a) / b;\n    }\n    \n\n    - Each of these functions implements a basic arithmetic operation.\n    - The `divide` function checks for division by zero and throws an exception if the divisor is zero.\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\nI hope my cpp codes can be highlighted.\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"why are my cpp codes not highlighted?\" (#65735)"},{"Id":"3678500156","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-30T22:12:47","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"65734","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update notes to use consistent formatting in various guides","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This effectively means all radio options in the form model must be strings.\n\nFor example:\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-radio-group',\n  imports: [Field],\n  template: `\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Do you like the new signal forms API?</legend>\n      <div>\n        <input id=\"option-yes\" type=\"radio\" [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\" value=\"true\" />\n        <label for=\"option-yes\">Yes</label>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <input id=\"option-no\" type=\"radio\" [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\" value=\"false\" />\n        <label for=\"option-no\">No</label>\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  `,\n  styles: ``,\n})\nexport class RadioGroup {\n  private readonly questionModel = signal<{ likeSignalForms: 'true' | 'false' }>({\n    likeSignalForms: 'true',\n  });\n  protected readonly questionForm = form(this.questionModel);\n}\n```\nThis forces the model to use string literal types.\n\n#### Lack of type-checking for value on radio inputs\n\nAnother related issue: the value binding for radio inputs is not type-checked against the form model. It is currently possible to bind any value, even if it is not part of the model’s union type, and the compiler does not complain.\n```ts\nimport { Component, effect, signal } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Field, form } from '@angular/forms/signals';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-radio-group',\n  imports: [Field],\n  template: `\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Do you like the new signal forms API?</legend>\n      <div>\n        <input id=\"option-yes\" type=\"radio\" [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\" [value]=\"true\" />\n        <label for=\"option-yes\">Yes</label>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <input\n          id=\"option-no\"\n          type=\"radio\"\n          [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\"\n          [value]=\"'doesNotExistInModel'\"\n        />\n        <label for=\"option-no\">No</label>\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  `,\n  styles: ``,\n})\nexport class RadioGroup {\n  private readonly questionModel = signal<{ likeSignalForms: 'true' | 'false' }>({\n    likeSignalForms: 'true',\n  });\n  protected readonly questionForm = form(this.questionModel);\n\n  constructor() {\n    effect(() => {\n      console.log(this.questionModel().likeSignalForms);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n```\nSelecting the second radio button sets the model value to `doesNotExistInModel`, which is not a valid value according to the model type.\n\nIdeally, the template should be type-checked so that the `[value]` binding for a given radio group must be assignable to the corresponding field type in the model.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n#### Allow non-string field types for radio inputs\nAllow binding a `FieldTree<T>` where `T` is not necessarily `string` (e.g. `boolean`):\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-radio-group',\n  imports: [Field],\n  template: `\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Do you like the new signal forms API?</legend>\n      <div>\n        <input id=\"option-yes\" type=\"radio\" [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\" [value]=\"true\" />\n        <label for=\"option-yes\">Yes</label>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <input id=\"option-no\" type=\"radio\" [field]=\"questionForm.likeSignalForms\" [value]=\"false\" />\n        <label for=\"option-no\">No</label>\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  `,\n  styles: ``,\n})\nexport class RadioGroup {\n  private readonly questionModel = signal<{ likeSignalForms: boolean }>({ likeSignalForms: true });\n  protected readonly questionForm = form(this.questionModel);\n}\n```\nCurrently this fails with:\n`TS2322: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'`\n\n#### Type-check `[value]` against the field type\nMake the type of `[value]` for a given `<input type=\"radio\" [field]=\"...\" />` be constrained to the field’s type. For example, if the model says:\n```ts\nsignal<{ likeSignalForms: 'true' | 'false' }>(...)\n```\nthen `[value]` for that radio group should only accept `'true' | 'false'`, and using `'doesNotExistInModel'` should be a compilation error.\n\nThis would prevent invalid model states and make signal forms more type-safe and ergonomic.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- *Use string values and map on submit*\nKeep the field as `'true' | 'false'`, then map to boolean (or another type) when handling form submission.\nDownside: more boilerplate, and the form model doesn’t reflect the real domain types.\n- *Wrap in a custom radio group control*\nImplement a custom component that internally handles mapping between primitive HTML value strings and richer types.\nDownside: duplicates logic that might be better handled by the forms/signals integration itself.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65726","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal forms: support non-string types for radio inputs and type-check radio values\" (#65726)"},{"Id":"3677580779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-30T09:44:28","Actor":"waterplea","Number":"65724","RawContent":null,"Title":"Host directive with provider breaks viewProviders","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI was trying to use `formControlName` is a nested component which requires:\n```ts\nviewProviders: [{ provide: ControlContainer, useExisting: FormGroupDirective }],\n```\nBecause `formControlName` injects parent `formGroup` directive with `@Host` decorator.

See the `npm ls` output before the upgrade:\n\n```\nSTEP 9/13: RUN npm ls @angular-devkit/schematics\ndemo@0.0.0 /demo\n+-- @angular/cli@20.3.12\n| +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n| `-- @schematics/angular@20.3.12\n|   `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n`-- angular-eslint@19.8.1\n  +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@19.2.19\n  `-- @angular-eslint/schematics@19.8.1\n    `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@19.2.19 deduped\n\nSTEP 10/13: RUN grep '\"version\"' node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/package.json\n  \"version\": \"19.2.19\",\n```\n\nand after the failed update attempt (note that the package was successfully updated by `ng update`/`npm`, just the migration script crashed afterwards):\n\n```\nSTEP 12/13: RUN npm ls @angular-devkit/schematics\ndemo@0.0.0 /demo\n+-- @angular/cli@20.3.12\n| +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n| `-- @schematics/angular@20.3.12\n|   `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n`-- angular-eslint@20.7.0\n  +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n  `-- @angular-eslint/schematics@20.7.0\n    `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n\nSTEP 13/13: RUN grep '\"version\"' node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/package.json\n  \"version\": \"20.3.12\",\n```\n\nI already tried to report the issue to `angular-eslint`, as it was the update/migration process of `angular-eslint` that failed, but the issue got \"closed as not planned\" because I am supposed to update `angular-eslint` at the same time as angular according to the author of `angular-eslint`, see: https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint/issues/2807\n\nI then tried to report the issue to `angular` as documentation issue, because the documentation mentions in no way that upgrading further packages at the same time as the angular core framework migth be required. This issue also got \"closed as not planned\", because angular recommends to *not* upgrade third-party packages at the same time as the framework, but recommends a step-by-step upgrade, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65692\n\nNoten that the issue is usually only observable in a step-by-step upgrade process, because only in that case `@angular/schematics` will first be installed as local dependency for `@angular-cli` and then moved in the last step of the upgrade, but the issue is not observable if everything is upgraded at once. Actually, I am unsure whether the issue is within `@angular/cli`, or `angular-eslint` is mis-using the angular upgrade process or specifies dependencies in a way that are not supported by the Angular project. If you can pinpoint a specific way `angular-eslint` is using angular wrong (or in an unsupported way), I am ready to report another issue and possibly a merge request to `angular-eslint`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31974","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng update may crash if npm relocates core angular packages while migrations are running\" (#31974)"},{"Id":"3675210796","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-28T15:06:21","Actor":"Aukevanoost","Number":"31973","RawContent":null,"Title":"Heap corruption error on windows when createCompilerPlugin is called before serveWithVite","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv19.x\n\n### Description\n\nOk so this is a complex one, I've already lost a couple of days on this. \n\nNative federation is using the \"createCompilerPlugin\" to create reusable artifacts (read dependencies) to be used in the Angular application. Now we know this is kind of an \"own risk\" scenario, especially since it's in the private folder of the @angular/build package but I am slowly losing it.\n\nSome context \nWhen we do \"ng serve\" on our own builder, _which is basically a wrapper around the default angular build_, we use ESbuild to build some packages that we want to re-use across Angular micro frontends. The code can be found in our [esbuild-adapter.ts](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/native-federation/src/utils/angular-esbuild-adapter.ts) and our [builder.ts](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/native-federation/src/builders/build/builder.ts). The interesting part is that we don't get an error when we remove the [AngularCompilerPlugin](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/c77a7d387cd4d453d790b7b457332615120b0278/libs/native-federation/src/utils/angular-esbuild-adapter.ts#L297C1-L300C9) which we use to pre-build our artifacts. \n\nThe error\nSince Angular 20, we have the issue that during the [serveWithVite](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/c77a7d387cd4d453d790b7b457332615120b0278/libs/native-federation/src/builders/build/builder.ts#L361C7-L361C20) and to be precise in [the line where vite is imported.](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/0b439685dda66ce190afa2da425f02b8e5c94147/packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite/index.ts#L184), an heap error occurs. We thought it could be ESbuild since it's also used in the vite package, but all our tries have been without result so far. \n\n[Whe have an issue with all the context](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/issues/970). _Note:_ that all assumptions so far were wrong.  Even after ng21, the issue still persists. I thought it was a race condition [when closing/disposing the compiler-plugin](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/issues/970#issuecomment-3552223609) but this is not the case. \n\nNow I know micro frontends and using the private part of the @angular/build is for our own risk, but I would never expect a heap error. Does anyone know how this could happen or what could cause this?  Final note: It is a race condition so it happens every now and then, about 40% of the ng serve builds. It happens only on windows and you can recognize the error by the build/serve just stopping without any error. \n\nAll help is welcome, thanks a bunch in advance.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nWe have a reproducable repo: https://github.com/berkon/ng-serve-crash-reproduction (it also crashes when you update to ng21). \n\njust npm ci and npm start. Even updating to ng21 doesn't help\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nProcess finished with exit code -1073740940 (0xC0000374)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nJust windows 10+, reest can be seen in the repository\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31973","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Heap corruption error on windows when createCompilerPlugin is called before serveWithVite\" (#31973)"},{"Id":"3675092134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-28T14:17:46","Actor":"NoNamer777","Number":"31972","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vitest configuration partially ignore?","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen providing a custom vite config for testing with vitest, not all properties are respected.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/dnd-mapp/dma-resources-client\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nI've configured vitest with the following settings:\n- browser based testing with playwright.\n- enabled code coverage reporting.\n- overwritten the output directory of the vitest reports and coverage reports.\n- enabled UI when the `CI` environment variable is not set.\n\nI need to install `jsdom` or `happy-dom` in order to be able to run tests, while I don't use any of these environments. I get the following error if I don't have any of these dependencies installed:\n\n```text\n> ng test -c dev\n\nThe following packages are required but were not found:\n  - A DOM environment is required for non-browser tests. Please install either \"jsdom\" or \"happy-dom\".\nPlease install the missing packages and rerun the test command.\n```\n\nAfter that it seems like the that even though I've overwritten the output directory of the reporters and the code coverage reporters, somehow reports and code coverage reports are also outputted at `coverage/<project-name>` and `coverage/<project-name>/coverage`, but the coverage reports are missing where I actually want them (`reports/coverage`).\n\nIn dev mode, the `ui` setting seems to be ignored entirely.\n\nFurthermore, the code coverage calculation seems to be totally wrong since it's reporting 0% coverage while there practically no lines, branches, functions, or statements, but the only component that is currently present in the linked repository is tested to verify that it can render.\n\n\nI'd expect that I shouldn't need to have `jsdom` or `happy-dom` installed as dependency if I have not configured either of these environments to be used for vitest.\nI'd also expect my reports and coverage reports to be outputted where I have configured them to be outputted and that the UI is enabled when I want it to.\n\n\n### Please provide the

test builds on macOS","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nHi team 👋,\n\nI am encountering an **ENAMETOOLONG** error when running tests with the `@angular/build:karma` builder.  \nThis happens because Angular generates extremely long output filenames for test source maps, which include the **full absolute path** of the component under test.\n\nOn macOS (and some CI environments), the filesystem limits paths to **255 characters**, and the generated spec map paths exceed this limit.\n\n### Example error\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nWhen the project structure is nested (common in enterprise monorepos), the combined absolute path of the repo + project + feature modules + filename becomes extremely long (300–390+ chars).\n\nThis makes the test runner fail with `ENAMETOOLONG` before execution even starts.\n\n### Impact\n- Test builds cannot run on macOS  \n- CI pipelines fail  \n- Refactoring large monorepos becomes extremely difficult  \n- Developers must manually shorten folder structures even when logically correct  \n\n---\n\n## ✔ **Suggested solutions**\n\n### **Option 1 — Shorten or hash test output paths**\nEmit something like:\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n\ninstead of embedding the entire directory path.\n\n### **Option 2 — Add a configuration flag (e.g. `\"shortPath\": true`)**\nSomething

present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIt seems that there is no way to configure the coverage reports' location in the new `@angular/build:unit-test` using `vitest`.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI created a new Angular 21 project with `ng new`.\n\nChanged `angular.json`:\n\n```\n\"test\": {\n  \"builder\": \"@angular/build:unit-test\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"runnerConfig\": \"vitest.config.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`vitest.config.ts` is the following:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {\n    coverage: {\n        enabled: true,\n        reportsDirectory: './foobar'\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\nI'm running `ng test --coverage`.\n\nThe reports are still generated into `./coverage/angular21project` instead of `./foobar`.\n\nI think this is a bug.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   /

CommonJS imports are no longer supported.\n\nIf you're on modern Node versions (≥ 20), this should be transparent and have no impact.\n\n##### Node.js Version Requirement\n\n**Minimum Node.js version is now 20.x**\n\nNode.js versions below 20 are no longer supported. Please upgrade to Node.js 20 or later.\n\nNode min versions: `>=23.5.0 || ^22.13.0 || ^21.7.0 || ^20.12.0`\n\n##### Deprecated APIs Removed\n\nThe following deprecated APIs have been removed after being deprecated in previous releases:\n\n##### `list` prompt alias removed (affects `inquirer` package only)\n\nThe `list` alias has been removed from the `inquirer` package. This only impacts users of the legacy `inquirer` package, not users of `@inquirer/prompts` or individual prompt packages.\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available (inquirer package only)\nimport inquirer from 'inquirer';\nconst answer = await inquirer.prompt([\n  { type: 'list', name: 'choice', message: 'Pick one:', choices: ['a', 'b'] }\n]);\n\n// ✅ Use 'select' instead\nimport inquirer from 'inquirer';\nconst answer = await inquirer.prompt([\n  { type: 'select', name: 'choice', message: 'Pick one:', choices: ['a', 'b'] }\n]);\n```\n\n##### `helpMode` theme property removed\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answer = await select({\n  theme: { helpMode: 'never' }\n});\n\n// ✅ Use theme.style.keysHelpTip instead\nconst answer = await select({\n  theme: {\n    style: {\n      keysHelpTip: () => undefined // or your custom styling function\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis affects the following prompts:\n\n- `@inquirer/checkbox`\n- `@inquirer/search`\n- `@inquirer/select`\n\n##### `instructions` config property removed\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answer = await checkbox({\n  instructions: 'Custom instructions'\n});\n\n// ✅ Use theme.style.keysHelpTip instead\nconst answer = await checkbox({\n  theme: {\n    style: {\n      keysHelpTip: (text) => 'Custom instructions'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis affects the following prompts:\n\n- `@inquirer/checkbox`\n- `@inquirer/search`\n- `@inquirer/select`\n\n##### `cancel()` method removed\n\nThe `cancel()` method on prompt return custom `Promise` has been removed.\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answerPromise = input({ message: 'Name?' });\nanswerPromise.cancel();\nconst answer = await answerPromise;\n\n// ✅ Use AbortSignal instead\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst answer = await input(\n  { message: 'Name?' },\n  { signal: controller.signal }\n);\ncontroller.abort();\n```\n\n##### Color Library Change: yoctocolors → Node.js `styleText`\n\n**Internal change:** The project now uses Node.js built-in `util.styleText()` instead of the `yoctocolors` package for terminal colors. This makes Inquirer smaller and reduces risks of vulnerabilities coming from transitive dependencies.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

We currently cannot ship `@pnpm/exe` as `pkg` doesn't work with ESM [#&#8203;10190](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10190).\n- Node.js runtime is not added to \"dependencies\" on `pnpm add`, if there's a `engines.runtime` setting declared in `package.json` [#&#8203;10209](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10209).\n- The installation should fail if an optional dependency cannot be installed due to a trust policy check failure [#&#8203;10208](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10208).\n- `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` now display npm: protocol for aliased packages (e.g., `foo npm:is-odd@3.0.1`) [#&#8203;8660](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8660).\n- Don't add an extra slash to the Node.js mirror URL [#&#8203;10204](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10204).\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the store contains Node.js packages [#&#8203;10131](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10131).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After i try to run the app locally it just throws me error in browser console :  Uncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null right at the line of service extends baseService{\nmore or less the same issue like in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27991#issue-2388955540 just in my case if i disable AOT everything works with no issues . Checked for circular deps and there is no any , checked for barel exports and also none , tried multiple days to debug deleting and combining diferent versions of libs etc... nothing works . Also checked all the official update procedures and docs , nothing similar is mentioned thre .\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCant share any of the code so not sure how helpful will this be but in general i have huge app with multiple modules and services working together . The problem lies somewhere in services that are extending base service , as soon as you remove one reported the other one that extends base service is reported . This is not happening when AOT is set to false but really hard to debug lost already a week already. Beside that all other fns when AOT is set to false works as expected with all the latest libs and angular updated to v20 so i Assume it has to be issue somewhere in compiler , or not even the issue but some new feature not documented correctly for those usecases .\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nUncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n```\n\n### Your

For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"engines\": {\n      \"runtime\": {\n        \"name\": \"node\",\n        \"version\": \"^24.11.0\",\n        \"onFail\": \"download\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If the package with the Node.js runtime dependency is a CLI app, pnpm will bind the CLI app to the required Node.js version. This ensures that, regardless of the globally installed Node.js instance, the CLI will use the compatible version of Node.js.\n\n  If the package has a `postinstall` script, that script will be executed using the specified Node.js version.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10141](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10141)\n\n- Added a new setting: `trustPolicy`.\n\n  When set to `no-downgrade`, pnpm will fail installation if a package’s trust level has decreased compared to previous releases — for example, if it was previously published by a trusted publisher but now only has provenance or no trust evidence.\n  This helps prevent installing potentially compromised versions of a package.\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8889](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8889).\n\n- Added support for `pnpm config get globalconfig` to retrieve the global config file path [#&#8203;9977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9977).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When a user runs `pnpm update` on a dependency that is not directly listed in `package.json`, none of the direct dependencies should be updated [#&#8203;10155](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10155).\n- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#&#8203;10160](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10160).\n- Setting `gitBranchLockfile` and related settings via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` should work [#&#8203;9651](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9651).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

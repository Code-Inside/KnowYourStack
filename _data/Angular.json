For example in .NET Core project we are using proxy to map API calls to the .NET Core dev server. This works perfectly with the webpack builder. With the new builder any call to `/api` results in a 404 error and the request does not seem to get to the .NET dev server. \r\n\r\nI know not all options are supported yet, but in the didn't see `proxyConfig` being mentioned in the Known Limitations section of the help article. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`angular.json` excerpt:\r\n```json\r\n\"build\": {\r\n  \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"outputPath\": \"dist/my-proj\",\r\n    \"index\": \"projects/my-proj/src/index.html\",\r\n    \"main\": \"projects/my-proj/src/main.ts\",\r\n    \"polyfills\": \"projects/my-proj/src/polyfills.ts\",\r\n    \"tsConfig\": \"projects/my-proj/tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n    \"inlineStyleLanguage\": \"scss\",\r\n    \"assets\": [\r\n      \"projects/my-proj/src/favicon.ico\",\r\n      \"projects/my-proj/src/assets\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"styles\": [\r\n      \"shared/bootstrap.scss\",\r\n      \"shared/kendo-theme.scss\",\r\n      \"projects/my-proj/src/styles.scss\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"allowedCommonJsDependencies\": [\r\n      \"argsarray\",\r\n      \"immediate\",\r\n      \"inherits\",\r\n      \"spark-md5\",\r\n      \"vuvuzela\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"scripts\": []\r\n  },\r\n  \"configurations\": {\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      \"budgets\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"initial\",\r\n          \"maximumWarning\": \"3.75mb\",\r\n          \"maximumError\": \"4mb\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"anyComponentStyle\",\r\n          \"maximumWarning\": \"2kb\",\r\n          \"maximumError\": \"4kb\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"replace\": \"projects/my-proj/src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n          \"with\": \"projects/my-proj/src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"outputHashing\": \"all\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"development\": {\r\n      \"buildOptimizer\": false,\r\n      \"optimization\": false,\r\n      \"vendorChunk\": true,\r\n      \"extractLicenses\": false,\r\n      \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n      \"namedChunks\": true\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"defaultConfiguration\": \"production\"\r\n},\r\n\"serve\": {\r\n  \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n  \"configurations\": {\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      \"browserTarget\": \"my-proj:build:production\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"development\": {\r\n      \"browserTarget\": \"my-proj:build:development\",\r\n      \"proxyConfig\": \"projects/my-proj/proxy.conf.js\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n},\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nProxy config file:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n    {\r\n        context: [\r\n            \"/api\",\r\n            \"/signalr\"\r\n        ],\r\n        target: \"https://localhost:7051\",\r\n        secure: false,\r\n        ws: true,\r\n        headers: {\r\n            Connection: 'Keep-Alive'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.4.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25337","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"proxyConfig option is not working with esbuild dev server\" (#25337)"},{"Id":"1748422879","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-09T13:03:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25342","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support proxy configuration array-form in esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"When using the Webpack-based browser application builder with the development server, the proxy configuration can be in an array form when using the `proxyConfig` option.

To compare use the methods .equals(), .compareTo(), .isBefore() or one that is more suitable to your use case._\r\n\r\nThis happen because  the code is using `cell.rawValue` at the following line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/1da7f15ff66ce30ad9888d56760bb149c960d2a6/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#LL515C40-L515C48\r\n\r\nI think it should be using `cell.compareValue` instead.\r\n\r\nA workaround can be made monkey patching `MatCalendarBody` (remember to use your date class check if not using js-joda)\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { MatCalendarBody } from '@angular/material/datepicker';\r\n\r\nconst originalIsInRange = MatCalendarBody.prototype._isInRange;\r\nMatCalendarBody.prototype._isInRange = function(value: number) {\r\n  const badValue = value as any;\r\n  if (badValue instanceof LocalDate) {\r\n    value = new Date(badValue.year(), badValue.monthValue(), badValue.dayOfMonth()).getTime();\r\n  }\r\n  return originalIsInRange.call(this, value);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI am pointing to the exact source line with the problem\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nUsing a custom DateAdapter for js-joda should work. The date range picker should not give an error with clicked.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAn exception when a date is clicked and the date class using by the DateAdapter doesn't support conversion to primitives.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.0.2\r\n@angular/material               16.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.3\r\nng-packagr                      16.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27255","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): Range picker fails when the adapter uses classes that can't be converted to primitives\" (#27255)"},{"Id":"1747739403","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-08T11:57:17","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27253","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: delete redundant words","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27253","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: delete redundant words\" (#27253)"},{"Id":"1747213796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-08T07:01:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27251","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/form-field): resolve scrolling performance issues","State":"open","Body":"MDC was setting `will-change` on a couple of elements which caused significant scrolling performance issues on pages with a lot of form fields.

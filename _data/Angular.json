All dates are one year less than the specified date in the Date var. It is impossible to actually have Year 0 in the Date Pipe. Year 0 will be displayed as 1 BC. 1 BC will be displayed as 2 BC... and so on. Are there any workarounds for this?

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:  #13482, #20033\r\n\r\nFor routing with `HashLocationStrategy`:\r\n\r\nIf dist files (`main.*.js`, `runtime.*.js`, `asset/*` ...) and host page (`index.html`) have different deploy path, (eg. `/static-content/my-app/` for dist files and `/my/app` for host page), a base-href tag is required for loading resources correctly.\r\n\r\nThe expected routed URL for component is based on host page's URL path (eg. `/my/app#/ui/component`).\r\n\r\nHowever the routed URL is based on path provided by base-href tag (eg. `/static-content/my-app/#/ui/component`) with current implementation.\r\n\r\nAn example reproduces this issue is [aio/contents/examples/upgrade-phonecat-3-final](/angular/angular/tree/master/aio/content/examples/upgrade-phonecat-3-final) (in test_docs_examples_1) - User cannot visit the application page with routed URL (ie: http://127.0.0.1:8080/app/#!/phones). Instead of application page, the content of app/ folder will be shown.\r\n\r\nI made an experiment to reproduce and explore this issue: [angular-hashlocationstrategy-experiments](https://github.com/yinyin/angular-hashlocationstrategy-experiments)\r\n\r\nIn summary, for an application serving its host page from http://example.com/my/app and serving other files from http://example.com/static-content/my-app/ (base-href=`/static-content/my-app/`), the flow with current implementation is:\r\n\r\n1. User open app URL: http://example.com/my/app\r\n2. User click on router link to navigate to a component with route link `/ui/component`\r\n3. `HashLocationStrategy` generates external URL `#/ui/component`\r\n4. The external URL `#/ui/component` pushed to history API\r\n5. Browser resolves URL with path from base-href tag (`http://example.com/static-content/my-app/`) and `#/ui/component` to form a new URL http://example.com/static-content/my-app/#/ui/component\r\n6. The new URL is placed on browser's address bar: http://example.com/static-content/my-app/#/ui/component.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nMakes HashLocationStrategy to generate external URL with pathname of\r\nhost page (index.html)'s location.\r\n\r\nBased on previous example, for an application serving its host page from http://example.com/my/app and serving other files from http://example.com/static-content/my-app/ (base-href=`/static-content/my-app/`), the flow with current implementation is:\r\n\r\n1. User open app URL: http://example.com/my/app\r\n2. User click on router link to navigate to a component with route link `/ui/component`\r\n3. `HashLocationStrategy` generates external URL `/my/app#/ui/component` by concatenating pathname-of-host-page (`index.html`), hash-mark (`#`), `APP_BASE_HREF` (if given) and route link\r\n4. The external URL `/my/app#/ui/component` pushed to history API\r\n5. Browser resolves URL with base-href tag (`http://example.com/static-content/my-app/`) and `/my/app#/ui/component` to form a new URL http://example.com/my/app#/ui/component\r\n6. The new URL is placed on browser's address bar: http://example.com/my/app#/ui/component.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28116","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): explicitly use pathname of host page to make external URL\" (#28116)"},{"Id":"398678626","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-13T17:13:33","Actor":"malgosiastp","Number":"28115","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: ng config link fix","State":"open","Body":"Fixed 'ng config' link to lead to proper CLI command site.

Reloading the page resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I was looking through the Google Analytics (GA) data today, I noticed that there was a spike in errors just after the holidays:\r\n\r\n![3e00d684-1fac-4168-b553-36246907cdf9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/216296/51087361-18375480-1707-11e9-9e94-ed1ee1652b35.jpeg)\r\n\r\n[Google Analytics report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=1#/my-reports/6kIX47hKQVWyoXNpJVIIaA/a8594346w94746691p98770826/_u.date00=20190105&_u.date01=20190112&1240-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&1240-table.rowStart=0&1240-table.rowCount=50)\r\n\r\nNotice how the spike starts just around Jan 7 when most people got back from holidays, and relatively quickly things come back to normal within the next few days.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the error causes, you’ll see that the main root cause is failing to download certain JS chunks, mainly the “toc-module” chunk (there are some others if you go into the report and look at the long tail of errors,  but they are less common).\r\n\r\nThis makes me believe that the problem I observed in the past and this error spike after holidays are related.\r\n\r\nHere is my interpretation of the events:\r\n- many people were on angular.io before holidays and visited only the home page but not any api/guide doc (the toc-module case), and others visited other pages as well and their case is captured in the long tail of errors other than “toc-module”.\r\n- these people left their app open, then came back around Jan 7 and tried to use the app for a new navigation\r\n- in the meantime we deployed many new versions of angular.io, changing the fingeprints of chunks\r\n- when the new navigation occured in the long-running app, the app (webpack module loader) tried to download the chunk for the missing code (e.g. toc-module)\r\n- the server however no longer hosted that chunk because we redeployed angular.io with new versions since then and returned 404\r\n- it’s uncommon that we fail to load code in this way, so the app just paniced and got stuck in the “loading document” state.\r\n- user had to reload the page to recover and since reloading helped, people just shrug and moved on without reporting the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are at least three problems we need to fix:\r\n- [ ] the module loading errors should not cause the app to freak out, we should either display the snack bar telling the user that there was an error and they should try to reload, or we should consider reloading the page automatically (but ensure we don’t end up in an infinite loop of reloads if a reload doesn’t cause the app to recover)\r\n- [ ] we should somehow deal with the client-server version skew (have service-worker cache all chunks lazily, host old chunk versions, etc)\r\n- [ ] look into why “toc-module” fails so frequently and consider prefetching and caching it along with the main chunk","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28114","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"angular.io app gets stuck in “loading document” state, likely due to client-server version skew\" (#28114)"},{"Id":"398667219","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-13T15:15:31","Actor":"han41858","Number":"28113","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: angular.kr link added","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If I conditionally narrow down to one type in the code below, using instanceof, I see an error due to a type that I am not referencing in the if block. If I try to build using ng serve, the CLI compiler fails with the error below, although active editing only causes the error to show in the console while it states that it compiled successfully, as well as showing the error in my IDE.\r\n\r\nHere is the minimal code where the problem occurs:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n  @Input() parentForm: FormGroup | NgModelGroup | NgForm;\r\n  @Input() options: {values: any};\r\n\r\n  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {};\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    if (this.parentForm instanceof NgModelGroup || this.parentForm instanceof NgForm) {\r\n\r\n    } else if (this.parentForm instanceof FormGroup) {\r\n      this.options.values.forEach(value => {\r\n        this.parentForm.addControl(value.value, this.fb.control(\"\"));\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\r\nI receive the error:\r\n<pre><code>Property 'addControl' does not exist on type 'FormGroup | NgModelGroup | NgForm'.\r\n  Property 'addControl' does not exist on type 'NgModelGroup'.</code></pre>\r\nAccording to the Typescript spec, I shouldn't even need an \"else if\".

This gives quite a big boost in the project at work (at least 10s on each iterative build!)\r\n\r\nFixes #3603\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is a pain in a big application to wait until entire app is rebuilt just to run single `fit` block. Takes almost a minute with 4000+ tests and barely works when code coverage is enabled. \r\n\r\nMissing: docs(?)\r\n\r\nExample tasks for vscode:\r\n````\r\n{\r\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n  \"tasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"test selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": []\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"switch selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\",\r\n        \"--spec-update\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n      \"isBackground\": true\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nPS.

It's an easy step to forget when someone adds a new component, or renames them, or moves them to a different subdirectory. Using index.ts files you can get them all exported to a top-level directory, and then iterate over the import to get them all added to your module. This works fine for development but when I run a prod build it thinks I've never imported the components, even though they clearly are. As near as I can tell the only reason for this is that the names don't show up as an explicit import in the file itself.\r\n\r\nI've done some console logging and confirmed that the output of this method is identical to if I just statically add them to the declarations array. There are no stray elements getting in, and every component is listed. \r\n\r\nI assume I'm missing some understanding of how the aot compilation handles index files and how that impacts this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nThis approach only seems to fail for components inside prod/aot builds. For non-prod/aot builds it works fine, for adding services to the module's providers it works, for importing ngrx effects it works. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13416","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dynamic component imports/declarations in prod builds\" (#13416)"},{"Id":"398395142","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-11T18:04:57","Actor":"sebastian-zarzycki-es","Number":"13415","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-kit / dev-server doesn't properly check new fine-grained optimization build property","State":"open","Body":"### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.1\r\nNode: 10.6.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\nCreate new project with ng new, then start with ng-serve\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\nThe server starts with following warning:\r\n```\r\n****************************************************************************************\r\nThis is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications locally.\r\nIt hasn't been reviewed for security issues.\r\n\r\nDON'T USE IT FOR PRODUCTION!\r\n****************************************************************************************\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\nThis warning was not present in previous build, unless you've been running production builds (optimization: true)\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nRelevant code in froom @dev-kit/(...)/dev-server/index.js\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (browserOptions.optimization) {\r\n                this.context.logger.error(core_1.tags.stripIndents `\r\n            ****************************************************************************************\r\n            This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications locally.\r\n            It hasn't been reviewed for security issues.\r\n\r\n            DON'T USE IT FOR PRODUCTION!\r\n            ****************************************************************************************\r\n`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince optimization is automatically translated to an object (from boolean) now, it will always be true.

So my stackblitz simulates this with having option1 as a variable in OnInit I put a setTimeout for 2 seconds to change the string and there error comes up.\r\n\r\nI guess I am wondering if this is truly a bug or if I need to do something different to not allow this to happen. I did get this to work by manually calling a change detection after the localize variable we have gets populated (and take the pipe out of the equation) but this is a workaround to the problem I feel like.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dynamic change in label of mat-option gives ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\" (#14793)"},{"Id":"398064051","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-10T23:36:42","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"14792","RawContent":null,"Title":"MatFormField documentation should prefer outline/fill style","State":"open","Body":"In the most recent Material Design update, the \"standard\" / \"legacy\" style is now omitted from the spec with only the outline and fill styles remaining.

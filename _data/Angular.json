We can save some memory by returning the same one.\r\n3. Reworks the `AfterRenderCallback` so that it injects `NgZone` and `ErrorHandler` itself, instead of expecting them to be passed in.

you've considered\n\nEvery app will import `environment.prod.ts` instead of `environment.ts`. So when `npx ng build:ssr`, the environment used is the production environment. But this is not a solution since now I do not have access to the development `environment.ts`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26091","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"fileReplacements for @angular-devkit/build-angular:ng-packagr\" (#26091)"},{"Id":"1955844698","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-22T10:22:26","Actor":"HymanZHAN","Number":"26090","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild` reloads when navigating to lazy routes for the first time, causing navigation to fail.","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSimilar issue: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25455\r\n\r\nWhen serving with the Vite dev server, with caching enabled but no existing cache for lazy routes, the page will reload when I click on a link to a lazy route.

A _very very_ naive idea is that the Vite dev server only reads the cache when it first launches, only writes to the cache before it shuts down, and keeps behaving as if there is no such thing as a cache during the whole life cycle of its process.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI have [a minimal repo](https://github.com/HymanZHAN/esbuild-issue) with the reproduction.\r\n\r\n### Exception

However, for users using the \"color\", \"typography\", and \"density\" mixins only, they will need to include the \"base\" mixin as well.\r\n\r\nThis schematic works by scanning all of the app's Sass to determine which components had their \"color\", \"typography\", or \"density\" mixins included, but did *not* have their \"theme\" mixin included. It then locates all of the calls to \"mat.core()\" and inserts calls to the \"base\" mixins for the identified compoennts, immediately following. It makes sense to use \"mat.core()\" as a signal for when to insert them, because the \"base\" mixins should be used once-per-app, like \"mat.core()\". We can't guarantee that a \"$theme\" will be available at the insertion point, so we create a \"$dummy-theme\" to pass to the base mixins.\r\n\r\nWe also insert a comment above the new mixins explaining why they were added and a TODO to clean up the \"$dummy-theme\".

This is the code from the last example on this [page ](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/examples)\r\n\r\nHtml\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"example-container\" [class.example-is-mobile]=\"mobileQuery.matches\" *ngIf=\"shouldRun\">\r\n  <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\" class=\"example-toolbar\">\r\n    <button mat-icon-button (click)=\"snav.toggle()\"><mat-icon>menu</mat-icon></button>\r\n    <h1 class=\"example-app-name\">Responsive App</h1>\r\n  </mat-toolbar>\r\n\r\n  <mat-sidenav-container class=\"example-sidenav-container\"\r\n                         [style.marginTop.px]=\"mobileQuery.matches ? 56 : 0\">\r\n    <mat-sidenav #snav [mode]=\"mobileQuery.matches ? 'over' : 'side'\"\r\n                 [fixedInViewport]=\"mobileQuery.matches\" fixedTopGap=\"56\">\r\n      <mat-nav-list>\r\n        <a mat-list-item routerLink=\".\" *ngFor=\"let nav of fillerNav\">{{nav}}</a>\r\n      </mat-nav-list>\r\n    </mat-sidenav>\r\n\r\n    <mat-sidenav-content>\r\n      <p *ngFor=\"let content of fillerContent\">{{content}}</p>\r\n    </mat-sidenav-content>\r\n  </mat-sidenav-container>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nAnd css\r\n```\r\n.example-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-toolbar {\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  /* Make sure the toolbar will stay on top of the content as it scrolls past. */\r\n  z-index: 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1.example-app-name {\r\n  margin-left: 8px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is not fixed, stretch the sidenav container to fill the available space. This\r\n     causes `<mat-sidenav-content>` to act as our scrolling element for desktop layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this code is that on mobile the content in the sidenav container will be under the toolbar so a ``padding-top`` or a ```margin-top``` needs to be added. This forces me to know the breakpoint that the height of the toolbar changes and which variable to use.\r\n\r\nWhy can't you just expose one variable that tells me the height of the toolbar regardless of the screen size, something like ```--mat-toolbar-height```? At the end of the day, as a developer that is all I care about. Regardless of what my determination of a 'mobile' screen is I should just have to add something like this:\r\n```\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-height);\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninstead of having to do something like this (this may be wrong but you get the point):\r\n```\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-standard-height);\r\n}\r\n@media {what ever the toolbar media query is} {\r\n  .example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n   margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-mobile-height);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27975","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatToolbar): css variables for the actual height of the toolbar should be exposed\" (#27975)"},{"Id":"1954656824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T16:31:53","Actor":"devknoll","Number":"27973","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): use Renderer2 for theming instead of direct DOM manipulation","State":"open","Body":"Instead of directly manipulating the DOM via ElementRef (which requires DOM emulation), this change makes it use the Renderer2 interface instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27973","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): use Renderer2 for theming instead of direct DOM manipulation\" (#27973)"},{"Id":"1954307972","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T13:34:48","Actor":"Nikami","Number":"27971","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatChipList): chip list disabled should respect each chip item disabled state","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nChiplist [disabled] toggling from disable to enable doesn't respect each chip item [disabled] state.

This makes it difficult to attach overlays to the bottom of custom form fields in a clean non-hacky way.\r\n\r\nBasic example that demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Create a basic component that implements `MatFormFieldControl` (just directly copying the example [from the guide here](https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control) works for this).\r\n2. Add a simple `mat-autocomplete` and wire it up to the input on the component.\r\n3. Add a `MatAutocompleteOrigin` field to the component which points to the `MatFormField`'s `getConnectedOverlayOrigin()` (also may need to update this on ngOnInit to be safe).\r\n4. Set the `matAutocompleteConnectedTo` in the template to the `MatAutocompleteOrigin` field.\r\n\r\nPreviously this would make the autocomplete overlay open lined up below the bottom edge of the form field, now there is an unsightly gap.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/6vnpqz\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

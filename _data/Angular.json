Therefore I would expect that the person().name expression just works but it is still considered as possibly null.

No error or warning is emitted, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually wanted to do was:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>The count is: {{count}}</div>\r\n<button (click)=\"increment()\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the parenthesis added to `increment()`.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing because it is very easy to think that Angular will call the function in the event binding, when it is really executing the expression, and `increment` is a no-op expression.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAngular should emit an extended diagnostic which it sees an event binding bound to an expression with a callable signature. This would flag the mistake and clearly denote that the developer's intention was to invoke the function with `()`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nA slight variation would be to emit a diagnostic only when the expression is a callable _identifier_, as opposed to any expression. The main difference is whether or not Angular should warn in scenarios where the expression is not an identifier, but we know it's a function such as:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"counter.increment\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's reasonable to emit in this situation. A related issue is where a function returns which the developer doesn't care about such as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-component',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>The count is: {{count()}}</div>\r\n    <button (click)=\"incrementAndLaterDecrement()\">Increment</button>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  protected readonly count = signal(0);\r\n  protected incrementAndLaterDecrement(): () -> void {\r\n    this.count.update((c) => c + 1);\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      this.count.update((c) => c - 1);\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `incrementAndLaterDecrement` does return a function. Should it emit the diagnostic in this scenario?\r\n\r\nI think it should, as the developer is likely misusing `incrementAndLaterDecrement`, but there may be instances where they don't care about the returned function. In those cases I'm thinking they should drop the return value with `void` or maybe just add a semicolon?\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"void incrementAndLaterDecrement()\">Increment</button>\r\n\r\n<button (click)=\"incrementAndLaterDecrement();\">Increment</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeither of those are super clear to future readers why they are necessary. I kinda like `void` as I tend to see as a mechanism to \"swallow this value so the caller does not consume it\", which seems to fit the intention of \"ignore the curried function\". But `void` isn't super commonly used so I can understand it being unintuitive to others. Also I have no idea if our template syntax supports `void`, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't.\r\n\r\nBasically, we can consider whether we want to restrict this to purely callable _identifiers_ or any callable _expression_. I'm inclined to go with the later, but worth discussing for sure.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended diagnostic error when binding an event to an uncalled function\" (#56293)"},{"Id":"2336805838","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:55:35","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56292","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56292","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.7 release\" (#56292)"},{"Id":"2336760978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:18:06","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56291","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.1\" with changelog.\" (#56291)"},{"Id":"2336740291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T20:03:55","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"56290","RawContent":null,"Title":"ComponentFixture.whenStable doesn't detect event emitted from async output in zoneless CD","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn zoneless mode (i.e. with `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()`), a test using autoDetectChanges does not detect the changes caused by the emission of an event by a child output using an async EventEmitter (i.e. `new EventEmitter(true)`).\r\n\r\nTo make things clearer, use the minimal reproduction (see below), and execute the following commands in the terminal:\r\n\r\n- `cd app`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `ng serve`\r\n\r\nNote at this point that clicking the two buttons works as expected: the associated \"hello\" message becomes \"world\".\r\n\r\nNow run `ng test`.\r\n\r\nThe test for the \"Async\" section fails.

If so, I would greatly appreciate some advice. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. ng new test-project --ssr\r\n2. update angular.json with \"sourceMap\": true in the production build configuration.  \r\n3. ng build\r\n4. Set a breakpoint in server.ts - it will be red\r\n5. Add \"Launch Program\" configuration to launch.json, with \"program\" pointing to server.mjs and \"sourceMaps\": true \r\n6. Execute \"Launch Program\" debug. \r\n7. The server will start, but the breakpoint in server.ts will become an empty circle - Unbound breakpoint. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI don't think it matters, but I'm using macOS 14.5, VS Code 1.89.1, npm 10.8.1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27773","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't debug Server Typescript in an Angular SSR project  \" (#27773)"},{"Id":"2335469438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-05T15:12:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add `--inspect` option to the dev-server","State":"closed","Body":"This commit introduces an `--inspect` option to the dev-server, enabling debugging of server-side code when using SSR or SSG.

browser target for our service is ES5, and we are considering upgrading to ES6.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when upgrading to ES6, all users with Chrome version 61 or higher should be able to use the service.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is something confusing during the review.\r\nDifferential loading has disappeared from Angular since version 13, \r\nand the latest Angular seems to target those versions as shown in the document below.\r\nㄴ https://angular.dev/reference/versions#browser-support\r\n<img width=\"741\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/50862052/806ec83d-2140-4377-8157-fc93d74c648e\">\r\n\r\nAdditionally, looking at the angular/cli code, \r\nit seems that transpiling to the target will work fine when Chrome >= 61, but there is no part to inject core-js.\r\nIn other words, we felt that a separate polyfill for ECMAScript was needed in order for the users we were targeting to use the service properly.\r\n<img width=\"318\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/50862052/371e53db-aaa1-41db-b168-18ccd0e96b62\">\r\n<img width=\"585\"

I am curious as to whether Angular did not use core-js because it was intended to target the latest browsers as shown in the document above. Also, there may be services that support a wide browser target like ours, but I am wondering if there are any plans to include core-js.\r\n\r\n2. If there are no plans to modify, In order to inject polyfills for ECMAScript functions, \r\nshould services that use Angular go in the direction of specifying core-js separately in polyfills.ts?\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. I know that you always put a lot of effort into creating a good framework, and I am grateful.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nInserting core-js when building\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI can't think of any additional alternatives. I think it would be a good idea to tell us whether each service needs to import it separately.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27768","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"When building services with a broad browser target, why not use core-js within angular/cli?\" (#27768)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2334615999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T20:18:58","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"29195","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog): Make autofocus work with animations disabled","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #29194, blocked on https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29203","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29195","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/dialog): Make autofocus work with animations disabled\" (#29195)"},{"Id":"2334605453","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T20:18:58","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"29194","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/dialog): auto-focusing a CSS class doesn't work when animations are disabled","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAuto-focusing a CSS class fails when animations are disabled\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/yuzht5-trwt8i?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

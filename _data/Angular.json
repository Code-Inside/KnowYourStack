Regular validation errors didn't carry their field because it was assumed it could be trivially inferred from context.\r\n\r\nError summaries (which are forthcoming) break this assumption, as they combine both regular and tree validation errors from an entire form into a single list. Without explicitly carrying their associated field, there's no way of knowing to which field a regular validation error is associated when obtained through an error summary.\r\n\r\nNote that while all validation errors now have a field, it's not explicitly required to define one when returning an error from a logic function callback in `validate()` or `validateTree()`. These functions will automatically add the current field by default to any errors missing a field definition. This ensures that all validation errors returned from fields (e.g. `field.path.errors()`) _do_ have a defined field.\r\n\r\nThis change makes testing errors by equality more tedious; however, we only do so in our own tests to be comprehensive. In reality, it's expected that developers would simply check for an expected `error.kind` or similar property of a custom error.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63148","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add associated field to all validation errors\" (#63148)"},{"Id":"3319785285","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:28:46","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63147","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.2.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63147","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.2.0-rc.1 release\" (#63147)"},{"Id":"3319781155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:27:08","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63146","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#63146)"},{"Id":"3319738218","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:18:56","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63145","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63145","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.7 release\" (#63145)"},{"Id":"3319730212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:11:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63144","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63144","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.7\" with changelog.\" (#63144)"},{"Id":"3318209749","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T19:52:33","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63137","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.2.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular-devkit/architect-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.2002.0-next.3` -> `0.2002.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-devkit%2farchitect-cli/0.2002.0-next.3/0.2002.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular-devkit/build-angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-devkit%2fbuild-angular/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular-devkit/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-devkit%2fcore/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular-devkit/schematics](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular-devkit%2fschematics/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular/build](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fbuild/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular/cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcli/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `b5b6047` -> `f52c339` |\n| [@angular/ssr](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fssr/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| [@schematics/angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli) | dependencies | patch | [`20.2.0-next.3` -> `20.2.0-rc.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@schematics%2fangular/20.2.0-next.3/20.2.0-rc.0) |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `368d4b7` -> `eb1df17` |\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `368d4b7` -> `eb1df17` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/angular-cli (@&#8203;angular-devkit/architect-cli)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.2002.0-rc.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli/compare/fd322fc5bc319c0202a296b6a2a3bddd728fefe4...f1f54cc0c7f2f27e262364f07ee072af2f632f20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli/compare/fd322fc5bc319c0202a296b6a2a3bddd728fefe4...f1f54cc0c7f2f27e262364f07ee072af2f632f20)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

This method is asynchronous because it waits for all `APP_INITIALIZERS` to complete, and some of them may return a `Promise`.\n\nThis causes an issue when creating the `NgElement` strategy:\n- Since `createApplication` is async, the strategy creation must be wrapped in a `Promise`.\n- As a result, the strategy is initialized no earlier than the next microtask, which prevents fully synchronous creation.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> This change is internal only and is tightly coupled to the implementation in #61752. It is not intended for general public API use.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an internal option to `internalCreateApplication` in `core`:\n\n```ts\nrejectAsyncInitializers: boolean;\n```\n\nWhen enabled, if any APP_INITIALIZER returns a Promise, it will throw an error instead of waiting for it. This ensures that the application is created synchronously.\n\nExpose internal only `.sync` variant for method `createApplication` in `platform-browser`.\n\nExample usage inside `NgElement`:\n\n```ts\nconst injector =\n  this.injector ??\n  ('injector' in config ? config.injector : null) ??\n  ('applicationConfig' in config\n    ? createApplication.sync(config.applicationConfig).injector\n    : null);\n```\n\nIf an async initializer is present:\n\n```\nError: Async APP_INITIALIZER detected while `rejectAsyncInitializers` is enabled.\n```\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63135","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support synchronous application creation by rejecting async `APP_INITIALIZERS`\" (#63135)"},{"Id":"3317881133","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T10:35:44","Actor":"ahimik","Number":"63134","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add event bindings for animation start and completion when using the new animate.enter and animate.leave syntax.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nanimations\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, with the Angular animations library, we can declaratively handle animation completion like this:\n\n```\n<div @fadeOutOnLeave (@fadeOutOnLeave.done)=\"executeSomeBusinessLogic()\"></div>\n```\n\nWith the new class-based animate approach, there is no straightforward way to listen for animation completion events:\n\n```\n<div animate.leave=\"fade-out\"></div>\n```\n\n**Use Case:**\nI need to execute business logic after an element is removed from the DOM, i.e., when its leave animation has completed.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince Angular already determines the longest animation automatically, and attaches event listeners internally to remove the element from the DOM when all animations are finished, it would be valuable to expose hooks for animation start and completion so developers can tie into that lifecycle without duplicating internal logic.\n\n```\n<div\n  animate.leave=\"fade-out\"\n  (animate.leave.start)=\"onLeaveStart()\"\n  (animate.leave.done)=\"onLeaveDone()\">\n</div>\n```\n\nor:\n\n```\n<div [animate.leave]=\"{ classes: ['fade-out'], onStart: onLeaveStart, onDone: onLeaveDone }\"></div>\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrent Workaround:\n\nAt the moment, I’m forced to implement a custom directive that:\n* Accepts a callback for animation completion.\n* Repeats Angular’s internal logic for:\n   Determining the longest animation duration on host element.\n   Attaching animationend/transitionend listeners.\n   Invokes the callback once all animations are complete when the element is removed from the DOM.\n\nThis results in duplicated logic that Angular already performs internally for animate.leave.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63134","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add event bindings for animation start and completion when using the new animate.enter and animate.leave syntax.\" (#63134)"},{"Id":"3317220023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T07:22:40","Actor":"ryan-bendel","Number":"63131","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): Fixes IsolatedShadowDom encapsulation method","State":"open","Body":"This fixes an issue where a child component inside of IsolatedShadowDom would get it's styles moved to the root style object, causing it to be unstyled.

The problem was as follows:\n\n  1. Yarn in Plug'n'Play mode on Windows stores its global module cache on the `C:` drive\n  2. Some developers put their projects on the `D:` drive\n  3. Yarn generates relative paths that use `../..` to get from the project directory to the cache directory\n  4. Windows-style paths don't support directory traversal between drives via `..` (so `D:\\..` is just `D:`)\n  5. I didn't have access to a Windows machine for testing this edge case\n\n  Yarn works around this edge case by pretending Windows-style paths beginning with `C:\\` are actually Unix-style paths beginning with `/C:/`, so the `../..` path segments are able to navigate across drives inside Yarn's implementation. This was broken for a long time in esbuild but I finally got access to a Windows machine and was able to debug and fix this edge case. So you should now be able to bundle these projects with esbuild.\n\n- Preserve parentheses around function expressions ([#&#8203;4252](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4252))\n\n  The V8 JavaScript VM uses parentheses around function expressions as an optimization hint to immediately compile the function. Otherwise the function would be lazily-compiled, which has additional overhead if that function is always called immediately as lazy compilation involves parsing the function twice. You can read [V8's blog post about this](https://v8.dev/blog/preparser) for more details.\n\n  Previously esbuild did not represent parentheses around functions in the AST so they were lost during compilation. With this change, esbuild will now preserve parentheses around function expressions when they are present in the original source code. This means these optimization hints will not be lost when bundling with esbuild. In addition, esbuild will now automatically add this optimization hint to immediately-invoked function expressions. Here's an example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  const fn0 = () => 0\n  const fn1 = (() => 1)\n  console.log(fn0, function() { return fn1() }())\n\n  // Old output\n  const fn0 = () => 0;\n  const fn1 = () => 1;\n  console.log(fn0, function() {\n    return fn1();\n  }());\n\n  // New output\n  const fn0 = () => 0;\n  const fn1 = (() => 1);\n  console.log(fn0, (function() {\n    return fn1();\n  })());\n  ```\n\n  Note that you do not want to wrap all function expressions in parentheses.

The code generator creates a template code for the interaction of the backend with the main application. As a result of the work of the code generator, we get angular libraries for sending http requests as separate services to each api. \nTo simplify local development, it was not possible to directly link the artifacts of the first application to the main one, because in the runtime, the main application code could not create an instance of the imported services for sending http requests. \nThe application crashed with the error *NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Environment Injector)[_HttpService -> _HttpService...)*. In my opinion, the described behavior is a bug. Didn't found anything about issue on working with npm link during angular library development.\nFound on Angular 12, node 16.

This broke basic type inference in all RxJS Observables. The only reasonable solution I found was to upgrade to the unsupported version `\"rxjs\": \"~7.5.0\",`. Perhaps Angular should recommend that in the [documentation](https://angular.dev/reference/versions)?\n\nOddly I didn't find anything related to this anywhere. I can reproduce this systematically just by changing rxjs' version.

The problem was as follows:\n\n  1. Yarn in Plug'n'Play mode on Windows stores its global module cache on the `C:` drive\n  2. Some developers put their projects on the `D:` drive\n  3. Yarn generates relative paths that use `../..` to get from the project directory to the cache directory\n  4. Windows-style paths don't support directory traversal between drives via `..` (so `D:\\..` is just `D:`)\n  5. I didn't have access to a Windows machine for testing this edge case\n\n  Yarn works around this edge case by pretending Windows-style paths beginning with `C:\\` are actually Unix-style paths beginning with `/C:/`, so the `../..` path segments are able to navigate across drives inside Yarn's implementation. This was broken for a long time in esbuild but I finally got access to a Windows machine and was able to debug and fix this edge case. So you should now be able to bundle these projects with esbuild.\n\n- Preserve parentheses around function expressions ([#&#8203;4252](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4252))\n\n  The V8 JavaScript VM uses parentheses around function expressions as an optimization hint to immediately compile the function. Otherwise the function would be lazily-compiled, which has additional overhead if that function is always called immediately as lazy compilation involves parsing the function twice. You can read [V8's blog post about this](https://v8.dev/blog/preparser) for more details.\n\n  Previously esbuild did not represent parentheses around functions in the AST so they were lost during compilation. With this change, esbuild will now preserve parentheses around function expressions when they are present in the original source code. This means these optimization hints will not be lost when bundling with esbuild. In addition, esbuild will now automatically add this optimization hint to immediately-invoked function expressions. Here's an example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  const fn0 = () => 0\n  const fn1 = (() => 1)\n  console.log(fn0, function() { return fn1() }())\n\n  // Old output\n  const fn0 = () => 0;\n  const fn1 = () => 1;\n  console.log(fn0, function() {\n    return fn1();\n  }());\n\n  // New output\n  const fn0 = () => 0;\n  const fn1 = (() => 1);\n  console.log(fn0, (function() {\n    return fn1();\n  })());\n  ```\n\n  Note that you do not want to wrap all function expressions in parentheses. This optimization hint should only be used for functions that are called on initial load. Using this hint for functions that are not called on initial load will unnecessarily delay the initial load. Again, see V8's blog post linked above for details.\n\n- Update Go from 1.23.10 to 1.23.12 ([#&#8203;4257](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4257), [#&#8203;4258](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4258))\n\n  This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain false positive reports (specifically CVE-2025-4674 and CVE-2025-47907) from vulnerability scanners that only detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack (webpack)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.101.1`](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.101.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.101.0...v5.101.1)\n\n##### Fixes\n\n- Filter deleted assets in `processAdditionalAssets` hook\n- HMR failure in defer module\n- Emit assets even if invalidation occurs again\n- Export types for serialization and deserialization in plugins and export the `ModuleFactory` class\n- Fixed the failure export of internal function for ES module chunk format\n- Fixed `GetChunkFilename` failure caused by `dependOn` entry\n- Fixed the import of missing dependency chunks\n- Fixed when entry chunk depends on the runtime chunk hash\n- Fixed `module.exports` bundle to ESM library\n- Adjusted the time of adding a group depending on the fragment of execution time\n- Fixed circle dependencies when require `RawModule` and condition of `isDeferred`\n- Tree-shakable module library should align preconditions of `allowInlineStartup`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The div has a click listener, presumably to focus the native `<input>` when any part of the field is clicked.\n\nThis results in a redundant tab stop, creating a confusing navigation experience for keyboard users.\n\nThe recommended fix is to add `tabindex=\"-1\"` to the div.mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper. This will remove the element from focus sequence while preserving its click functionality.\n\nThe error probably occurs in other Angular Material components, so please fix it there as well.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSample usage of component - to be verified on Adroid WebView!\n**StackBlitz link:** https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-jwyrngj8?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a basic Angular application that includes a form with `<mat-form-field>` matInput component.\n2. Build this application and run it inside an Android WebView (e.g., in a Capacitor, Cordova, or native Android project).\n3. Connect physical keyboard to the Android device (e.g. bluetooth keyboard connected to Mobile with Android).\n4. Open the app and use the Tab key to navigate through the page elements.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen tabbing towards a mat-form-field, focus should move directly from the previously focused element to the inner `<input>` element. The wrapper _div (.mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper)_ should be skipped entirely in the tab order, as it is not an interactive control itself.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe keyboard focus first lands on the _div.mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper_. The user must then press Tab a second time to move focus from the wrapper to the actual `<input>` element. This creates a \"ghost\" tab stop that provides no user-facing functionality and disrupts the logical navigation flow.\n\n### Environment\n\n- **Angular:** any from 5.2.5 to 20.1.5 (latest)\n- **CDK/Material:** any from 5.2.5 to 20.1.5 (latest)\n- **Browser(s):** Android System WebView\n- **Operating System:** verified on Android 14 and 15","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31669","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Accessibility: mat-form-field redundant focus on Android WebView with keyboard\" (#31669)"},{"Id":"3299992807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T10:51:50","Actor":"benelliott","Number":"31668","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(M2 theming): M2 theming guide references defunct background and foreground palettes","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nSince the release of 20.1.0, Material 2 components no longer use the `background` and `foreground` palettes for neutral colours (such as default-colour button backgrounds). However, these are still referenced in the Material 2 Theming guide - both in terms of the palette tokens being listed out, and in terms of being able to read the palette values via `mat.get-theme-color`. \n\nIn my opinion the fact that these are documented strengthens the argument that the move to `_mat-system` is a breaking change that should have been pushed to the next major release. Regardless, there is now a bug with the documentation because it references these outdated tokens that no longer do what the documentation claims.\n\n(More discussion in #31630)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/guide/material-2-theming#reading-values-from-a-theme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31668","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(M2 theming): M2 theming guide references defunct background and foreground palettes\" (#31668)"},{"Id":"3299690821","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T09:14:12","Actor":"6apc1k","Number":"31667","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(timepicker): Support for seconds","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, the timepicker only allows selection of hours and minutes.

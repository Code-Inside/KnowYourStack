If I create my form all at once... that is to say I create all the child forms in the object at the same time, the validity tracking works. If instead, I set one child form to null, then on the next line of code I set that null property to a new child form, the validity tracking is broken. \n\nIn the stackblitz example, I am building 3 instances of the same reactive form, but it's being built 3 times in different sets of steps as described above. To see the issue illustrated:\n   1. Delete the contents of the first Test Input, which has the 'required' validator on it. You will see all 6 'valid' booleans above the input change from 'true' to 'false', because the validation issue has propagated up the chain to all the ancestor forms. Now type something into the input and again you'll see all 6 booleans change back to 'true' because the validity has propagated up the chain successfully. \n   \n   2. Perform the same steps on the 2nd Test Input. Here you will see the booleans do not all update, as if the propagation is broken. Now type something into the input again and see the same 5 booleans change back to 'true'. So the base form here is not getting the update and the only difference is that I set the 'first' form to null and then created it on the next line. \n   \n   3. Repeat the same steps on the 3rd Test Input and see how the propagation is further broken here, as only 3 booleans update this time now that I'm also setting the 'second' form to null and then setting it on the next line. \n\nIs this expected behavior? This is an ultra-simplified example. In my real use case, we create the base form but we don't have the data yet to hydrate the children forms, so we have null checks if the data isn't there and we don't create those forms yet. Later when the user performs an action and we retrieve the data from the API, we create a form on those child properties. We have a large nested form where we are highlighting things red in the UI when the form or it's children forms are invalid. So if we instead create blank children forms, we'd have to go and disable the form controls to ensure they aren't counted invalid, which is a hassle. It's much cleaner to just check null AND invalid, but it's not working due to this bug.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa6f2249-9d26-4b4b-b2ef-1aa537d93f6d)\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-9rojtqfs?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere is no exception, just broken behavior\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.0\n@schematics/angular          19.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n\n\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"^7.8.1\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.5.0\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/build\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.6.3\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Setting form null during creation breaks chain of validity updates\" (#59309)"},{"Id":"2759791588","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:41:46","Actor":"khalilou88","Number":"59308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ability to not generate the host element","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHi,\nI like to use Angular to inline svg files in the template but the host element make them hard to style from the parent element like a button.\nIn my case, the host element need just inputs to overrides css styles, so I wish that Angular add a type of components that don't add a extra Dom element.\n\nThank you\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a type of components that don't add a extra Dom element a least for svg files.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe current solution is working fine, just add more steps to style svg files","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to not generate the host element\" (#59308)"},{"Id":"2759752303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:29:08","Actor":"mehedihasansjs","Number":"59307","RawContent":null,"Title":"string type control can be used on number type input field","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have declared a control with type string.\n \n```typescript\ncontrol = new FormControl<string>('')\n```\n\nbut I have applied the control on number type input field\n\n```html\n<input type=\"number\" formControlName=\"control\" />\n```\n\nThe control in the ends returns the value type number, but when I access the API of control's value I can only get string's API.\n\nMy suggestion is, either we can show error or warning if string type control returns value as number, or we can cast the value to string and bind to control's value.\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Version: 17.3.7\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59307","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"string type control can be used on number type input field\" (#59307)"},{"Id":"2759743061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:18:36","Actor":"mehedihasansjs","Number":"59306","RawContent":null,"Title":"minLength, maxLength validators does not work on number type value of control and does not throw error","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have used a control which returns value `number`. for validating max and min length, I have used `Validators.minLength` and `Validators.maxLength` also used `Validators.required`.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.28.0 - 20 Dec 2024\n\n-   Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.5.

Nevertheless, I wonder if there's really no way to mitigate the potential problems coming from it by throwing some sort of errors (at least at dev time). \n\nHere is a minimal example: \n```ts\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class Store {\n  private readonly state = signal({ value: 0 });\n\n  readonly counter = computed(() => this.state());\n  readonly frozenCounter = computed(() => Object.freeze(this.state()));\n\n  increase() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value + 1 }));\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value - 1 }));\n  }\n}\n\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <h3>App</h3>\n    <p>Computed: {{ value() }}</p>\n    <p>Store: {{ store.counter().value }}</p>\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {\n  protected readonly store = inject(Store);\n  protected readonly value = computed(() => this.store.counter().value);\n\n  increase() {\n    // this.store.increase(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value++; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value++; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    // this.store.decrease(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value--; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value--; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n}\n```\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bqez6f1y\n\nA service acting as a store is just a popular use case, but essentially any signal having an object is potentially affected by the same problem. In all such cases, exposing / passing `computeds` or `readonly` signals don't make 100% sure the state cannot be accidentally mutated. At least, I'm not aware of any \"ng-way\" to achieve it. \n\nSo I wonder: would be freezing / deepFreezing signals something the team has considered? For example as an opt-in in dev mode... [as recently done by ngrx-store team](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1). Alternatively, any other suggestion in userland to address the problem? \n\nI understand this might favour a more \"strictly immutable approach\" to the data flow... and in general, it might make the signal implementation more complicated. \n\nI hope I haven't missed anything trivial (in case sorry). \nThanks a lot! \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThat I'm aware of: \n- Opt-in freeze / deepFreeze for all signals (at least in dev mode) + runtime errors, \n- expose a `read` / `transform` / ... option for signal / computed and cherry-pick the cases to freeze: `const state = signal({ value: 0 }, {read: Object.freeze})` + runtime errors, \n- purely at ts level (likely impossible => breaking change + I'm for sure missing something else 😅): \n```ts\n// freeze case, deepFreeze likely more complicated (if DeepReadonly possible 😅)\ntype Readonly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };\n\ndeclare function computed<T>(computation: () => T, options?: CreateComputedOptions<T>): Signal<Readonly<T>>;\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(signal): better guardrails to avoid wrong signal object mutations\" (#59287)"},{"Id":"2754729306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:13:56","Actor":"jossephus","Number":"59286","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page","State":"open","Body":"simple PR :-)\r\nIt fixes missing code annotation in  routing-with-urlmatcher page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59286","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page\" (#59286)"},{"Id":"2754724132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:01:39","Actor":"Meehdi","Number":"59285","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix mermaid polygon node text visibility in dark mode","State":"open","Body":"Fix visibility issue with text inside polygon nodes in mermaid diagrams when using dark mode theme to ensure proper contrast and readability\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, when the same functionality is moved to an imported function in a separate file, the build fails with the error: **\"An error occurred while extracting routes.\"**\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**1. Create an API route directly in server.ts(works fine during build):**\n\n```\napp.get('/api/ping', (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  return res.json({\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    message: 'Ok'\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Refactor the response logic into a separate file, ping.controller.ts:**\n\n```\nexport default () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        uptime: process.uptime(),\n        message: 'Ok'\n      });\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**3. Import and use the ping.controller.ts function in server.ts(throws error during build)**\n\n```\nimport pingResponse from './controllers/ping.controller';\n\napp.get('/api/ping', async (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp: any = await pingResponse();\n  return res.json(resp);\n});\n\n```\n\n**4. Generate build using:**\n\n`npm run build`\n\n**5. angular.json config**\n\n```\n\"server\": \"src/main.server.ts\",\n\"outputMode\": \"server\",\n\"ssr\": {\n  \"entry\": \"src/server.ts\"\n}\n\n```\nI cannot move all the functions internally as all my routes rely on repository-based database queries, which are modular and imported from separate files. How to resolve this issue and ensure the Angular SSR build works with these imported functions?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

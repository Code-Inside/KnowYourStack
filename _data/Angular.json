I chose to commit that file here, and that will be required once aio is fully built with bazel, but if you prefer I can leave it uncommitted for now---running the bazel build on aio will just pop out an error with a command to generate it.\r\n\r\nAnother decision I made was to move the ngsw-config.json out of `src/generated` to the root. This is because on each regular build the `generated` folder is deleted, and since I would need a `BUILD.bazel` file in there to stamp the `write_source_files`, it would be deleted and someone developing using the regular build would see the file missing in their git diff. Another option I could do is to make that deletion script a bit more picky about what it deletes.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a first partial step in the migration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45022","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(bazel): add bazel target for aio build\" (#45022)"},{"Id":"1127645619","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-08T19:52:03","Actor":"jeschris45","Number":"45021","RawContent":null,"Title":"Jest Testing failing due to missing decorator (@Inject) in constructor of service files.

Which results in unwanted behavior.\r\n\r\n**AS-IS**\r\nI have a formGroup with multiple required fields (default angular required validator) and with updateOn: 'blur'. \r\nOn the formGroup i have 1 validator which checks if any one of the fields is touched and invalid, then an error message should be displayed.\r\nWhen initially entering the page, all fields are invalid, but none of them are touched --> no error message\r\nWhen i enter a value in the first field and blur --> first field is valid and touch, other invalid and untouched --> no error message\r\nBUT when i enter the next field, and immediately tab to the next without entering a value, the field is touched and invalid --> but still no error message is shown.\r\n\r\n**EXPECTED**\r\nIn the last use-case above, \r\n when i enter the next field, and immediately tab to the next without entering a value --> I expect the field to be invalid and touched and run my custom validator which then result in the error being displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**CAUSE**\r\nit seems that custom validators are only being ran on actual value change, and not on the actual blur functionality.\r\nEven when not changing values, but just blurring, i do want the custom validator to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION FOR MYSELF (NOT IDEAL)**\r\nCurrently i use the (blur) event on each field to update the value and validity of that field only when an empty field is blurred.\r\nI attached a link to a stackblitz where you can play around with the code.\r\nIn here you can see by the console log, that the custom validator is not being ran when click in and out a field.\r\nI commented out the fix, you can just uncomment these lines in the .ts and .html file, and then you have my current solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this should not be the expected behavior of running these validators on blur.\r\nOpen for discussion :) \r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

This made it hard to use bundling/loading tools like SystemJS that expect URI's in their module identifier.\r\n\r\nWith TypeScript 2.0, the compiler will look up definition of \"moduleA.js\" in ./moduleA.ts or ./moduleA.d.ts.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to be compatible with ES6 modules, which require the .js extension, as <script type=\"module\"></script> is standard in [evergreen browsers](https://caniuse.com/es6-module), and as for now TS doesn't provide an option to add the .js extension in transpiled files (see microsoft/TypeScript#13422).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\nAdd the resolve-typescript-plugin (or have an option to enable it) to the generated webpack config.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm just running a split project where the `server` package requires '.js' extensions and the 'client' package does not. This is obviously not ideal.\r\n\r\nCustom webpack builder can probably do this with this plugin: [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin) \r\n\r\nNodejs can apparently be [configured to experimentally customize the resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_customizing_esm_specifier_resolution_algorithm)\r\n<!-- ✍️-->","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22671","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow imports with .js extension for package.json \"type\": \"module\" esm compatibility.\" (#22671)"},{"Id":"1122262919","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-08T17:44:51","Actor":"kormide","Number":"22638","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: flip build script to bazel","State":"closed","Body":"This flips the cli build to use bazel, replacing the legacy build script with the bazel one.\r\n\r\nLooking for careful feedback on the second commit where I stop running bazel clean before a release build.

[`v14.0.0-next.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next2-2022-02-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.1...14.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### forms\n\n-   Forms \\[email] input coercion: forms \\[email] input value will be considered as true if it is defined with any value rather than false and 'false'.\n-   Objects with a length key set to zero will no longer validate as empty. This is technically a breaking change, since objects with a key `length` and value `0` will no longer validate as empty. This is a very minor change, and any reliance on this behavior is probably a bug anyway.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   This change may cause a breaking change in unit tests that are implicitly depending on a specific number and sequence of change detections in order for their assertions to pass.\n-   This tightens parameter types of `TransferState` usage, and is a minor breaking change which may reveal existing problematic calls. This may break invalid calls to `TransferState` methods.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The type of `initialUrl` is set to `string|UrlTree` but in reality,\n    the `Router` only sets it to a value that will always be `UrlTree`.\n    `initialUrl` is documented as \"The target URL passed into the\n    `Router#navigateByUrl()` call before navigation\" but the value\n    actually gets set to something completely different. It's set to the\n    current internal `UrlTree` of the Router at the time navigation\n    occurs. With this change, there is no exact replacement for the old value of\n    `initialUrl` because it was enver intended to be exposed.\n    `Router.url` is likely the best replacement for this.\n    In more specific use-cases, tracking the `finalUrl` between successful\n    navigations can also be used as a replacement.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [e46b379204](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e46b37920438d84bff895498c0a102dd1ffba178) | fix | implement missing transition delay ([#&#8203;44799](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44799)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [38c03a2035](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/38c03a20358db3f8621c023b98e627cd385731c0) | feat | support years greater than 9999 ([#&#8203;43622](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/43622)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [db6cf7e7c1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/db6cf7e7c168f9a25550d7fa53840c08b50b889c) | fix | allow banana-in-a-box bindings to end with non-null assertion ([#&#8203;37809](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/37809)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [0072eb48ba](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/0072eb48ba1c6f549703988b7fd7ba3e09058048) | feat | initial implementation of standalone components ([#&#8203;44812](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44812)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d5719c2e0f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d5719c2e0fb237be71d658444bbfe2410e05086a) | fix | input coercion ([#&#8203;42803](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/42803)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [8dd3f82f94](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8dd3f82f946bae86dc6c678d8694ab73d915bbfa) | fix | Correct empty validator to handle objects with a property `length: 0`.

This applies to `if` that do not have an `else`: these used to be counted as two branches, and they are now counted as one. This artificially increases branch coverage.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStarting from a minimal reproduction repository (`ng new`), make the following changes:\r\n1. Add `src/foo.ts`. Note that this function contains two branches to cover: the if, and the (non-explicitly written) else.\r\n```\r\nexport function foo(n: number) {\r\n  if (n % 2 === 0) {\r\n    console.log('hello');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Add `src/foo.spec.ts`:\r\n```\r\nimport { foo } from './foo';\r\n\r\ndescribe('test', () => {\r\n  it('test', () => {\r\n    foo(2);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n3. Restrict the test suite to run only `foo.spec.ts` in `src/test.ts`:\r\n```\r\nconst context = require.context('./', true, /foo\\.spec\\.ts$/);\r\n```\r\n4. Launch the tests with code coverage: `npx ng test --code-coverage`\r\n5. The output reports full coverage, of only one branch:\r\n```\r\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\r\nStatements   : 100% ( 2/2 )\r\nBranches     : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nLines        : 100% ( 2/2 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor comparison, downgrading to Angular 12 and to Typescript 4.3.5 results in the correct coverage report, which is:\r\n```\r\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\r\nStatements   : 100% ( 5/5 )\r\nBranches     : 50% ( 1/2 )\r\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\r\nLines

and keyword properties ([#&#8203;1998](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1998))\n\n    Previously enabling property mangling with `--mangle-props=` failed to add a space before property names after a keyword. This bug has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      static foo = {\n        get bar() {}\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify --mangle-props=.)\n    class Foo{statics={gett(){}}}\n\n    // New output (with --minify --mangle-props=.)\n    class Foo{static s={get t(){}}}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.14.19`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01419)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.18...v0.14.19)\n\n-   Special-case `const` inlining at the top of a scope ([#&#8203;1317](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1317), [#&#8203;1981](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1981))\n\n    The minifier now inlines `const` variables (even across modules during bundling) if a certain set of specific requirements are met:\n\n    -   All `const` variables to be inlined are at the top of their scope\n    -   That scope doesn't contain any `import` or `export` statements with paths\n    -   All constants to be inlined are `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, an integer, or a short real number\n    -   Any expression outside of a small list of allowed ones stops constant identification\n\n    Practically speaking this basically means that you can trigger this optimization by just putting the constants you want inlined into a separate file (e.g. `constants.js`) and bundling everything together.\n\n    These specific conditions are present to avoid esbuild unintentionally causing any behavior changes by inlining constants when the variable reference could potentially be evaluated before being declared. It's possible to identify more cases where constants can be inlined but doing so may require complex call graph analysis so it has not been implemented. Although these specific heuristics may change over time, this general approach to constant inlining should continue to work going forward.\n\n    Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const bold = 1 << 0;\n    const italic = 1 << 1;\n    const underline = 1 << 2;\n    const font = bold | italic | underline;\n    console.log(font);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify --bundle)\n    (()=>{var o=1<<0,n=1<<1,c=1<<2,t=o|n|c;console.log(t);})();\n\n    // New output (with --minify --bundle)\n    (()=>{console.log(7);})();\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>isaacs/minimatch</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.5`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v13.2.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1320-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1313v1320-2022-02-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.3...v13.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add more models to DeviceDescriptors ([#&#8203;7904](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7904)) ([6a655cb](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6a655cb647e12eaf1055be0b298908d83bebac25))\n-   **chromium:** roll to Chromium 99.0.4844.16 (r961656) ([#&#8203;7960](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7960)) ([96c3f94](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/96c3f943b2f6e26bd871ecfcce71b6a33e214ebf))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   make projectRoot optional in Puppeteer and launchers ([#&#8203;7967](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7967)) ([9afdc63](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/9afdc6300b80f01091dc4cb42d4ebe952c7d60f0))\n-   migrate more files to strict-mode TypeScript ([#&#8203;7950](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7950)) ([aaac8d9](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/aaac8d9c44327a2c503ffd6c97b7f21e8010c3e4))\n-   typos in documentation ([#&#8203;7968](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7968)) ([41ab4e9](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/41ab4e9127df64baa6c43ecde2f7ddd702ba7b0c))\n\n##### [13.1.3](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.2...v13.1.3) (2022-01-31)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   issue with reading versions.js in doclint ([#&#8203;7940](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7940)) ([06ba963](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/06ba9632a4c63859244068d32c312817d90daf63))\n-   make more files work in strict-mode TypeScript ([#&#8203;7936](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7936)) ([0636513](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/0636513e34046f4d40b5e88beb2b18b16dab80aa))\n-   page.pdf producing an invalid pdf ([#&#8203;7868](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7868)) ([afea509](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/afea509544fb99bfffe5b0bebe6f3575c53802f0)), closes [#&#8203;7757](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7757)\n\n##### [13.1.2](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.1...v13.1.2) (2022-01-25)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **package.json:** update node-fetch package ([#&#8203;7924](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7924)) ([e4c48d3](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/e4c48d3b8c2a812752094ed8163e4f2f32c4b6cb))\n-   types in Browser.ts to be compatible with strict mode Typescript ([#&#8203;7918](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7918)) ([a8ec0aa](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/a8ec0aadc9c90d224d568d9e418d14261e6e85b1)), closes [#&#8203;6769](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6769)\n-   types in Connection.ts to be compatible with strict mode Typescript ([#&#8203;7919](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7919)) ([d80d602](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/d80d6027ea8e1b7fcdaf045398629cf8e6512658)), closes [#&#8203;6769](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6769)\n\n##### [13.1.1](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.0...v13.1.1) (2022-01-18)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   use content box for OOPIF offset calculations ([#&#8203;7911](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7911)) ([344feb5](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/344feb53c28ce018a4c600d408468f6d9d741eee))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It's also an NX monorepo.\r\n\r\nI've just upgraded to Angular 13 (using `nx migrate` and the prod builds and main application serve are all working as expected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the small UI component app is not working with serve. Previously our script command in package.json used to use the `--base-href` flag, but now in Angular 13 this has been removed and gives message:\r\n\r\n> 'baseHref' is not found in schema\r\n\r\nSo I have removed the `--base-href` flag from the command in package.json.\r\n\r\nI've tried adding the exact same config to the angular.json file in the root of the project, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"build\": {\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n        \"baseHref\": \"/component-guide\",\r\n        // rest of config\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this has not worked. The actual serve command completes successfully, but when I try to hit my app in the browser at URL `localhost/component-guide` it just goes crazy and reloads like every 10 milliseconds (it is just reloading like crazy, the favicon is actually flashing, never seen anything like it)\r\n\r\nI also tried adding the same `baseHref` config to the project.json file in the apps/component-guide folder (and having it in both angular.json and project,json individually and at the same time).\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but there isn't a _minimal reproduction_ - my project is enormous and contains not just one but two separate applications. I can provide any additional information, or examples from my config files, but I cannot share the project as it is a commercial product.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nApplication reloads hundreds of times per second\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.2.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect           0.1301.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core                  13.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics       13.1.3\r\n@angular/cli                                13.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular                  13.1.3\r\nrxjs                                                6.5.5\r\ntypescript                                     4.5.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nWindows 10\r\nChrome 98\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22659","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Local serving does not work following upgrade to Angular 13\" (#22659)"},{"Id":"1125825262","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-07T17:56:53","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"22661","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/upload-artifact commit hash to 87348ce - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| actions/upload-artifact | action | digest | `82c141c` -> `87348ce` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

we please have support for adding static serve paths to the dev server?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible to proxy requests through to a different

exception occurred: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` (see below for extended error)\r\nng serve does not have this problem.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- A dynamic import of a json file: ```import(`../../../../../assets/animations/${this.animation}.json`).then(animation => {```\r\n- causes the error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`\r\n- Because in function [`extractIdentifiedModule`](https://github.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin/commit/55dd3f87c8f19338e45affec6f2271f75a0167ad#diff-1ceba7b65a6b2be17f78ef52a1cda37a99ce008020dabce02f3414141eb5261bR62-R81) the `directory` and `packageJson` are undefined\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by license-webpack-plugin@4.0.1, specifically the changes in commit https://github.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin/commit/55dd3f87c8f19338e45affec6f2271f75a0167ad\r\nAlso reported as bug to `license-webpack-plugin`: https://github.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin/issues/119\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nError\r\n<pre><code>\r\n✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')\r\nSee \"/tmp/ng-IvNqNx/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n`angular-errors.log`:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[error]

`--mangle-cache=` feature ([#&#8203;1977](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1977))\n\n    This release adds a cache API for the newly-released `--mangle-props=` feature. When enabled, all mangled property renamings are recorded in the cache during the initial build. Subsequent builds reuse the renamings stored in the cache and add additional renamings for any newly-added properties. This has a few consequences:\n\n    -   You can customize what mangled properties are renamed to by editing the cache before passing it to esbuild (the cache is a map of the original name to the mangled name).\n\n    -   The cache serves as a list of all properties that were mangled. You can easily scan it to see if there are any unexpected property renamings.\n\n    -   You can disable mangling for individual properties by setting the renamed value to `false` instead of to a string. This is similar to the `--reserve-props=` setting but on a per-property basis.\n\n    -   You can ensure consistent renaming between builds (e.g. a main-thread file and a web worker, or a library and a plugin). Without this feature, each build would do an independent renaming operation and the mangled property names likely wouldn't be consistent.\n\n    Here's how to use it:\n\n    -   CLI\n\n        ```sh\n        $ esbuild example.ts --mangle-props=_$ --mangle-cache=cache.json\n        ```\n\n    -   JS API\n\n        ```js\n        let result = await esbuild.build({\n          entryPoints: ['example.ts'],\n          mangleProps: /_$/,\n          mangleCache: {\n            customRenaming_: '__c',\n            disabledRenaming_: false,\n          },\n        })\n        let updatedMangleCache = result.mangleCache\n        ```\n\n    -   Go API\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          EntryPoints: []string{\"example.ts\"},\n          MangleProps: \"_$\",\n          MangleCache: map[string]interface{}{\n            \"customRenaming_\":   \"__c\",\n            \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n          },\n        })\n        updatedMangleCache := result.MangleCache\n        ```\n\n    The above code would do something like the following:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = {\n      customRenaming_: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      otherProp_: 3,\n    }\n\n    // Generated code\n    x = {\n      __c: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      a: 3\n    };\n\n    // Updated mangle cache\n    {\n      \"customRenaming_\": \"__c\",\n      \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n      \"otherProp_\": \"a\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add `opera` and `ie` as possible target environments\n\n    You can now target [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) and/or [Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx) using the `--target=` setting. For example, `--target=opera45,ie9` targets Opera 45 and Internet Explorer 9. This change does not add any additional features to esbuild's code transformation pipeline to transform newer syntax so that it works in Internet Explorer. It just adds information about what features are supported in these browsers to esbuild's internal feature compatibility table.\n\n-   Minify `typeof x !== 'undefined'` to `typeof x < 'u'`\n\n    This release introduces a small improvement for code that does a lot of `typeof` checks against `undefined`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    y = typeof x !== 'undefined';\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x!=\"undefined\";\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x<\"u\";\n    ```\n\n    This transformation is only active when minification is enabled, and is disabled if the language target is set lower than ES2020 or if Internet Explorer is set as a target environment. Before ES2020, implementations were allowed to return non-standard values from the `typeof` operator for a few objects. Internet Explorer took advantage of this to sometimes return the string `'unknown'` instead of `'undefined'`. But this has been removed from the specification and Internet Explorer was the only engine to do this, so this minification is valid for code that does not need to target Internet Explorer.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>csstools/postcss-plugins</summary>\n\n### [`v7.3.1`](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/blob/HEAD/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;731-February-3-2022)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/compare/51bfb76c1c427bd953f4816dab4ea1c759b60a85...15a2fbaf6330ed49d76af5b1f60d2ace92e83349)\n\n-   Ensured that `debug` option uses a single instance per run, this allows for `debug` to work on parallel runs within CI environments.\n-   Normalized exports to support both Common JS and ESM within our modules.

ora spinner with default \"stdErr\" stream can break test environments","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [X] test\r\n- [ ]

regression?\r\n\r\nThis was working in Angular <=10 because the \"ora\" package was not used to create a beautiful spinner in the console stream.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe ora spinner is using **process.stderr** as default stream which causes some test runners to fail the entire test execution because there was something written to the stdErr output.\r\nThis behavior can be changed to use **process.stdout** instead which should be enough for this kind of logging.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nusing e.g. karma 6.3.12\r\n\r\nng test any-library-you-want-to\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThere is no actual issue, but this is what the spinner is used for in the test command:\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\\ Generating browser application bundles (phase: building)...\r\n√ Browser application bundle generation complete.</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nI'm sure the spinner is used in other commands, too. But for the most uses cases (e.g. local development) writing to strErr stream is not relevant except for testing strategies. An issue in the stdErr stream could cause test runners to declare the run as failed even all tests succeeded.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Angular CLI: 11.2.0\r\nNode: 14.18.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.0\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1102.18\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1102.18\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.2.18\r\n@schematics/angular             11.2.18\r\n@schematics/update              0.1102.0\r\nng-packagr                      11.2.0\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.8</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nThis affects all versions of Angular 11+\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22642","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular using ora spinner with default \"stdErr\" stream can break test environments\" (#22642)"},{"Id":"1122487449","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T23:53:32","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"22641","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22641","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#22641)"},{"Id":"1122482139","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T23:18:33","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"22640","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v13.2.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"13.2.x\" branch to the next branch (master).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22640","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v13.2.2 release\" (#22640)"},{"Id":"1122461306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T23:11:49","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"22639","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v13.2.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22639","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v13.2.2\" with changelog.\" (#22639)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1127907288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-09T00:37:54","Actor":"zarend","Number":"24384","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): update active date on focusing a cell","State":"open","Body":"When a a date cell on the calendar recieves focus, set the active date\r\nto that cell.

You can use it on macOS by installing Safari Technology Preview 15.4. You can use it on iOS by installing iOS 15.4 Beta.\r\n2. When you try scrolling the examples you'll see the virtual list will not scroll at all.\r\n  - When using macOS, you'll see the vertical scrollbar no longer appears. You can't scroll using a mouse scroll wheel either.\r\n  - When using iOS, touch-based scrolling doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIf you open the same examples on Safari 15.3 (current stable version), the lists scroll and the vertical scrollbar is present on macOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nVirtual scroll lists can scroll on Safari 15.4 like they do on Safari 15.3.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nVirtual scroll lists do not scroll on Safari 15.4.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n(This is inferred from the StackBlitz examples for the examples at https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/examples .)\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.0.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Safari 15.4\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS, iOS","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24373","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(VirtualScroll): Safari 15.4 breaks virtual scroll; unable to scroll the list\" (#24373)"},{"Id":"1127872902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-08T23:38:12","Actor":"keith-aa","Number":"24383","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Datepicker): Cannot highlight specific dates with v13","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTried running the \"Highlighting specific dates\" example from https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview on Stackblitz.

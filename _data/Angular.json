The stackblitz link below has more details but the gist of it is:\n\n1. I have a root provided service that performs some aggregation logic in a computed over a set of Signals that are registered with it by component scoped services.\n2. When the component scoped services are destroyed they unregister their signal.\n3. If the aggregation computed has run but now has no consumers, it will hold onto a reference to the destroyed component scoped service via the dependency tracking of the aggregate computed.\n\nThe odd thing I noticed is that if the registered Signal is created with signal() then there is no leak. But if the registered signal is a computed() then there is a leak. I expected both to leak or neither to leak.\n\nI understand that normally a computed's dependencies are not recalculated if it's not being read but would it make sense for dependencies to be recalculated when one is being destroyed? Or when there are no readers?\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-k2tnpvcd?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66353","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unexpected reference leak when aggregating signals\" (#66353)"},{"Id":"3786608967","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T21:32:39","Actor":"PawelKawula","Number":"66354","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fixed incorrect link in migrating-to-vitest.md","State":"open","Body":"provided correct link to section about vitest fake timer\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

arguments:\n{}\nOutput\nNo Angular workspace found.

Here we chose to start using Vite as well. However, we have been running into some issues regarding the HMR websocket connection that is being setup by Vite to notify about changes and such. We are using a custom name `portal.domain.dev` for local development. Running Angular 20 in a docker container (like we have done for years) with the following docker command: \n\n`node /opt/project/node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve --port 4201 --host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-hosts=all --ssl --ssl-cert /etc/ssl/certs/domain.dev_public_chain.pem --ssl-key=/etc/ssl/certs/domain.dev.key`\n\nWe have configured this `portal.domain.dev` in our hosts file on our machines. We then open the page using `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` and see the following in the browser console: \n\n```\nAngular is running in development mode.\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\nclient:755 WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:755\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:759Understand this error\nclient:765 [vite] failed to connect to websocket.\nyour current setup:\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[HTTP]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[WebSocket (failing)]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\nCheck out your Vite / network configuration and https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr .\n```\n\nWe also noticed that when we go to `https://localhost:4201/` and accept the certificate issue there, going back to `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` would allow the websocket connection using its fallback attempted connection on localhost. See the following from the browser console:\n\n```\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\ndebug_node.mjs:18311 Angular is running in development mode.\nclient:760 [vite] Direct websocket connection fallback. Check out https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr to remove the previous connection error.\n```\n\nWe also have one other project we are updating to Angular 20 where we use `localhost` instead of `portal.domain.dev`. This issue is not present there.\n\nWe have spent quite a bit of time to try and fix this. But we traced this back to the HMR host configuration, which to our knowledge is not configurable through the CLI and is fully encapsulated, preventing us from exerting influence on this part of Vite. To bypass this we have developed a patch which fixed this issue and allows us to configure `server.hmr.host`. We are considering using this patch because this does fix our issue when we configure it to be `portal.domain.dev`.

That class changes `box-sizing` and horizontal padding, which can change the effective wrapping width. When wrapping changes during measurement, `scrollHeight` can be underestimated, leaving the rendered `textarea` too short by one or more line.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Capture the `textarea`’s content width (`clientWidth` minus horizontal padding) before applying the measuring class.\r\n- While measuring, temporarily set `style.width` to that captured content width so wrapping stays identical to the rendered `textarea`.\r\n- Restore the previous width immediately after measuring.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nAdded a regression test that uses padding + `box-sizing: border-box` and a wrapping-sensitive value to ensure the measured height matches `scrollHeight`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- Breaking changes: None\r\n- Behavior change: text field no longer will have clipping due to width changes in life span\r\n- Browser compatibility: Fixes the issue in Chrome and Edge (and potentially other browsers)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32612","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/text-field): autosize measure scrollHeight with stable wrapping width\" (#32612)"},{"Id":"3778687018","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:14:35","Actor":"originalajitest","Number":"32611","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/text-field): fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom","State":"open","Body":"## Fix scrollbar appearing with decimal line-height values in textarea autosize\r\nFixes [#32178](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32178)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen using a `<textarea>` with `cdkTextareaAutosize` and a decimal `line-height` value (e.g., `1.15`), a vertical scrollbar appears even when the content fits within the view. This issue occurs at certain browser zoom levels (e.g., 110%) where fractional pixel values get truncated by the browser.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is in the `_measureScrollHeight()` method, which subtracts `4` from the measured `scrollHeight` to account for the 2px top and bottom padding added by the measuring class. However, when the browser truncates fractional pixels (e.g., `20.4px` becomes `20px`), subtracting `4` can result in a height that's slightly less than what's actually needed, causing a scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChanged the subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()`. This provides a small margin that accounts for fractional pixel truncation, preventing scrollbars from appearing when using decimal line-height values.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.ts`**: Changed subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()` method\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.spec.ts`**: Added test `'should not show scrollbar with decimal line-height values at 110% zoom'` that verifies the fix and would fail if the value was `4`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added a unit test that simulates the fractional pixel truncation scenario\r\n- Test verifies that no scrollbar appears when using decimal line-height values\r\n- Test would fail if the subtraction value was `4`, ensuring the fix is properly validated\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- **Breaking changes**: None\r\n- **Behavior change**: Textareas with decimal line-height values will no longer show unnecessary scrollbars\r\n- **Browser compatibility**: Fixes the issue in Chrome and Edge (and potentially other browsers) at certain zoom levels","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/text-field): fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom\" (#32611)"},{"Id":"3774439243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-02T13:32:21","Actor":"g-cheishvili","Number":"32609","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/accordion): make `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` members protected for extensibility","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request refactors the `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` classes to improve extensibility and internal access for derived classes.

`preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen building an Angular **library** (using partial compilation mode / ng-packagr), binding to the `preserveContent` input on `AccordionPanel` causes the following error:\n\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe `AccordionPanel` directive uses `hostDirectives` to expose `DeferredContentAware`:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 53)\nstatic ɵdir: ɵɵDirectiveDeclaration<AccordionPanel, \"[ngAccordionPanel]\", ...,\n  [{ directive: typeof DeferredContentAware; inputs: { \"preserveContent\": \"preserveContent\"; }; outputs: {}; }]>;\n```\n\nThe `preserveContent` input **IS exposed** via the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping, making it appear as a valid input on `AccordionPanel`. However, when Angular's AOT compiler type-checks a template binding like `[preserveContent]=\"true\"`, it needs to import the `DeferredContentAware` type to verify the binding.\n\nThe problem is that `DeferredContentAware` is imported from an internal module:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 4)\nimport { DeferredContentAware } from '@angular/aria/_deferred-content-chunk.js';\n```\n\nThe underscore prefix (`_`) indicates this is a private/internal module, and `DeferredContentAware` is **not re-exported** from `@angular/aria/accordion`.\n\n### The Inconsistency\n\n1. `AccordionPanel` **exposes** `preserveContent` as a usable input via `hostDirectives`\n2. But the **type** required to use this input (`DeferredContentAware`) is **not exported**\n3. This works in JIT mode (development) but **fails in AOT/partial compilation** (library builds)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: Unable to reproduce in StackBlitz as this requires a library build with ng-packagr (partial compilation mode). StackBlitz runs in JIT mode where the issue doesn't manifest.\n\n1. Create an Angular library project using ng-packagr\n2. Create a component that uses `AccordionPanel` with `preserveContent` binding:\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-accordion',\n  imports: [AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent],\n  template: `\n    <div ngAccordionGroup>\n      <button ngAccordionTrigger [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\">Toggle</button>\n      <div ngAccordionPanel\n           [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\"\n           [preserveContent]=\"true\">  <!-- THIS CAUSES NG3004 -->\n        <ng-template ngAccordionContent>\n          <p>Panel content</p>\n        </ng-template>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyAccordionComponent {}\n```\n\n3. Build the library:\n```bash\nng build my-library\n# or\nnpx ng-packagr -p ng-package.json\n```\n\n4. Observe the error:\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOne of the following:\n\n### Option A: Export `DeferredContentAware` (Preferred)\n\nExport `DeferredContentAware` from `@angular/aria/accordion` so that consumers can use the `preserveContent` input that is already exposed via `hostDirectives`:\n\n```typescript\n// @angular/aria/accordion/index.ts\nexport { DeferredContentAware } from '../_deferred-content-chunk';\nexport { AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent } from './accordion';\n```\n\n### Option B: Document the limitation\n\nIf `preserveContent` is intentionally internal, remove it from the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping or document that it cannot be used in library builds.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The `preserveContent` input appears to be available (TypeScript/IDE shows it as a valid input)\n- Development mode (JIT) works fine\n- Library builds (AOT partial compilation) fail with `NG3004`\n- There is no workaround - attribute binding `[attr.preserveContent]=\"true\"` bypasses the error but doesn't actually set the signal input value\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 21.0.4\nNode: 24.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.6.2\nOS: win32 arm64\n\nAngular: 21.0.6\n@angular/aria: 21.0.5\n@angular/cdk: 21.0.5\n\nBrowser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari (not browser-specific)\nOperating System: Windows 11 ARM64 (also reproducible on other platforms)\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Why `preserveContent` is needed\n\nWithout `preserveContent=true`, there can be content duplication issues when combining:\n- `ngAccordionContent` (deferred content)\n- `NgTemplateOutlet` (for user-provided content templates)\n- Native Angular animations (`animate.enter`/`animate.leave`)\n\nWhen the panel visibility changes, the deferred content system destroys/recreates views, which can conflict with animation lifecycle and `NgTemplateOutlet`, resulting in duplicate content appearing in the DOM.\n\n### Current Workaround\n\nThe only workaround is to not use `preserveContent` and avoid combining deferred content with animations - but this limits the functionality that Angular ARIA accordion can provide.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(aria/accordion): `preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds\" (#32590)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2026-01-07T03:30:02.8116404Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1979}

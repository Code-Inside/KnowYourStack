Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.3...v0.25.4)\n\n-   Add simple support for CORS to esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;4125](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4125))\n\n    Starting with version 0.25.0, esbuild's development server is no longer configured to serve cross-origin requests. This was a deliberate change to prevent any website you visit from accessing your running esbuild development server. However, this change prevented (by design) certain use cases such as \"debugging in production\" by having your production website load code from `localhost` where the esbuild development server is running.\n\n    To enable this use case, esbuild is adding a feature to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (a.k.a. CORS) for [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests). Specifically, passing your origin to the new `cors` option will now set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header when the request has a matching `Origin` header. Note that this currently only works for requests that don't send a preflight `OPTIONS` request, as esbuild's development server doesn't currently support `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n    Some examples:\n\n    -   **CLI:**\n\n            esbuild --servedir=. --cors-origin=https://example.com\n\n    -   **JS:**\n\n        ```js\n        const ctx = await esbuild.context({})\n        await ctx.serve({\n          servedir: '.',\n          cors: {\n            origin: 'https://example.com',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   **Go:**\n\n        ```go\n        ctx, _ := api.Context(api.BuildOptions{})\n        ctx.Serve(api.ServeOptions{\n          Servedir: \".\",\n          CORS: api.CORSOptions{\n            Origin: []string{\"https://example.com\"},\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    The special origin `*` can be used to allow any origin to access esbuild's development server. Note that this means any website you visit will be able to read everything served by esbuild.\n\n-   Pass through invalid URLs in source maps unmodified ([#&#8203;4169](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4169))\n\n    This fixes a regression in version 0.25.0 where `sources` in source maps that form invalid URLs were not being passed through to the output. Version 0.25.0 changed the interpretation of `sources` from file paths to URLs, which means that URL parsing can now fail. Previously URLs that couldn't be parsed were replaced with the empty string. With this release, invalid URLs in `sources` should now be passed through unmodified.\n\n-   Handle exports named `__proto__` in ES modules ([#&#8203;4162](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4162), [#&#8203;4163](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4163))\n\n    In JavaScript, the special property name `__proto__` sets the prototype when used inside an object literal. Previously esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS conversion didn't special-case the property name of exports named `__proto__` so the exported getter accidentally became the prototype of the object literal. It's unclear what this affects, if anything, but it's better practice to avoid this by using a computed property name in this case.\n\n    This fix was contributed by

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.8...20.0.0-next.9)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   the `TestBed.flushEffects()` was removed - use\n    the `TestBed.tick()` instead.\n-   `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` has several\n    breaking changes:\n    -   It is renamed to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig`\n    -   The behavior applies to *all* checkNoChanges runs\n    -   The `useNgZoneOnStable` option is removed. This wasn't found to be generally\n        more useful than `interval`\n-   afterRender was renamed to afterEveryRender.\n-   This commit deprecates `ng-reflect-*` attributes and updates the runtime to stop producing them by default. Please refactor application and test code to avoid relying on `ng-reflect-*` attributes.\n\n    To enable a more seamless upgrade to v20, we've added the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function (can be imported from the `@angular/core` package), which enables the mode in which Angular would be producing those attribites (in dev mode only). You can add the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function to the list of providers within the bootstrap call.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b7d3f3dbfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/b7d3f3dbfcfc40000ca34087d3b8b42319468177) | feat | Allow passing ScrollOptions to ViewportScroller ([#&#8203;61002](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61002)) |\n| [fc4a56d5c5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/fc4a56d5c5fa270dbb1402c7cafe6d4f2af571eb) | fix | rename httpResource function in factory ([#&#8203;60022](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60022)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c889382a20](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c889382a2044f9a024f475680c8573d0f7112562) | feat | detect missing structural directive imports ([#&#8203;59443](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59443)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d5fd7349fb](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d5fd7349fb8b3942f0727cd7ee62e7a7b231e9e4) | feat | introduce TestBed.tick() ([#&#8203;60993](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60993)) |\n| [e711f99d81](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e711f99d81ea7dbd4526f859c363244fccdf0626) | feat | move `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig` ([#&#8203;60906](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60906)) |\n| [d8fbb909ce](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d8fbb909ce4380c0ea48512cf5d364a2785fd428) | feat | rename afterRender to afterEveryRender and stabilize ([#&#8203;60999](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60999)) |\n| [8d82a39a60](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d82a39a601fbedee58f140a7432c4adf0b054ff) | fix | async EventEmitter error should not prevent stability ([#&#8203;61028](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61028)) |\n| [624be2ef0c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/624be2ef0c7255e62082751cc339d2cd618bd633) | fix | prevent stash listener conflicts ([#&#8203;59635](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59635)) |\n| [c2987d8402](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c2987d8402b7b03333b0081a7f97750cdf612e99) | refactor | stop producing `ng-reflect` attributes by default ([#&#8203;60973](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60973)) |\n\n##### http\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [ccc5cc068f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ccc5cc068f788013c19498c44d13530c1bc98912) | feat | add keepalive support for fetch requests ([#&#8203;60621](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60621)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.8`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next8-2025-04-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.7...20.0.0-next.8)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   'in' in an expression now refers to the operator\n\n##### core\n\n-   `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is\n    renamed to `provideZonelessChangeDetection` as it is now \"Developer\n    Preview\" rather than \"Experimental\".\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RedirectFn` can now return `Observable` or\n    `Promise`.

This change can affect tests which may rely on the old\n    behavior, often by making assertions on DOM elements that should have\n    been removed but weren't because DOM removal is delayed until animations\n    are flushed.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7a971766dc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a971766dc59691dc68da9439e180a6c4d7b17d8) | feat | add extended diagnostic for uninvoked track function on `@for` blocks ([#&#8203;60495](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60495)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [8744c9a165](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8744c9a165518b77d2037d1255827836326dadf4) | fix | ensure HMR works with different output module type ([#&#8203;60797](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60797)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4e88e18a8e](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/4e88e18a8ef0f19aed85316e80627ad6d2ec80a7) | feat | mark `toObservable` as stable ([#&#8203;60449](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60449)) |\n| [8d050b5bfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d050b5bfc49878f01777f71a37e34d5c1733b1b) | feat | stabilize linkedSignal API ([#&#8203;60741](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60741)) |\n| [866cea9a05](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/866cea9a057ac67fa3f679f1f3da18700926c15a) | feat | Stabilize PendingTasks Injectable ([#&#8203;60716](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60716)) |\n| [39a4e00464](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/39a4e00464465b1e5a7f894d0992254d43f5028f) | fix | fix ng generate [@&#8203;angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core):output-migration.

The prefix icon should create sufficient space for itself, and the label should respect this space when not floated.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter switching to a tab that was not initially active, the mat-label (placeholder) of the mat-form-field incorrectly overlaps with the matPrefix icon. The label does not seem to account for the space occupied by the prefix.

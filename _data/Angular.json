It seems when importing modules in the module declaration it does import the modules declarations. For example when I import the browser module it does not import NgIf, NgFor etc etc and when I import NgSelect it does not import any of its Schema or components. I am building the app without using angular-cli as I am currently migrating an app from angularjs to angular and moving it to use angular-cli would be an issue.\r\n\r\nI have set up the webpack config like\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst path = require('path'),\r\nAngularWebpackPlugin = require('@ngtools/webpack'),\r\nwebpack = require('webpack'),\r\nHtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'),\r\nWebpackDevServer = require('webpack-dev-server');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    entry: {\r\n        'test': { import: \"./app/app.module.ts\", filename: 'js/[name].bundle.min.js' },\r\n    },\r\n    mode: 'none',\r\n    output: {\r\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, \"dist\"),\r\n        clean: true\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: {\r\n        //extensions: ['.ts', '...'],\r\n        extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js', '.mjs', '.json']\r\n    },\r\n    optimization: {\r\n    },\r\n    plugins: [\r\n        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\r\n            moment: 'moment'\r\n        }),\r\n        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n            title: 'Test',\r\n            template: './app/index.hbs',\r\n            cache: false,\r\n            hash: true,\r\n            inject: false\r\n        }),\r\n        new AngularWebpackPlugin.AngularWebpackPlugin({\r\n            'tsconfig': 'tsconfig.json',\r\n            //\"compilerOptions\": {},\r\n            \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n            'jitMode': true\r\n        })\r\n    ],\r\n    module: {\r\n        rules: \r\n            [\r\n                { \r\n                    test: /\\.hbs$/i, \r\n                    use: \"handlebars-loader\",\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/, \r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\r\n                    loader: '@ngtools/webpack',\r\n                     include: /app[\\\\/]/,\r\n                    exclude: [ /node_modules/ ]                \r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[cm]?js$/,\r\n                    use: {\r\n                      loader: 'babel-loader',\r\n                      options: {\r\n                        cacheDirectory: true,\r\n                        compact: false,\r\n                        plugins: ['@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel'],\r\n                      },\r\n                      \r\n                    },\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.template\\.html$/,\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n                    use: \r\n                        [\r\n                            {\r\n                                loader: 'raw-loader',\r\n                                options: \r\n                                {\r\n                                    esModule: false,\r\n                                },\r\n                            }\r\n                        ],   \r\n                }, \r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.css$/i,\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n                    use: \r\n                        [  \r\n                            {\r\n                                loader: 'css-loader',\r\n                                options: {\r\n                                    import: false,\r\n                                    url: false,\r\n                                    modules: false\r\n                                }\r\n                            }    \r\n                        ]\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n        },\r\n        devServer: {\r\n            static: {\r\n              directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\r\n              watch: true\r\n            },\r\n            host: \"localhost\",\r\n            compress: true,\r\n            port: 5000,\r\n            server: 'https',\r\n            open: true,\r\n            liveReload: false,\r\n            hot: true,\r\n            client: {\r\n                overlay: true,\r\n                progress: true,\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the angular test app is\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\nimport 'zone.js';\r\n\r\nimport { NgSelectModule } from '@ng-select/ng-select';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    declarations: [\r\n        AppComponent\r\n    ],\r\n    imports: [\r\n        BrowserModule,\r\n        NgSelectModule,\r\n    ],\r\n    providers: [\r\n    ],\r\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)  \r\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));

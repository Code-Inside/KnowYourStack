Can `NgZone.run` avoid causing an application tick?\r\n\r\nEdit: Is the issue that the Subject can't reach the next child before an entire change detection cycle is complete? In that case, is it possible to queue up these calls somehow?\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-14-mark-for-check\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.2\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.2\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                14.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.2\r\nng-packagr                      14.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47185","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Excessive change detection when calling markForCheck inside zone.run\" (#47185)"},{"Id":"1342826013","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T10:21:36","Actor":"splincode","Number":"47184","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support `inject` inside host","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Tinkoff/taiga-ui/blob/main/projects/core/components/root/root.component.ts#L24\r\n\r\nin v12\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: `tui-root`,\r\n    templateUrl: `root.template.html`,\r\n    styleUrls: [`./root.style.less`],\r\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n    providers: [TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES_PROVIDER],\r\n    host: {\r\n        'data-tui-version': 'version',\r\n        '[style.--tui-duration]': `duration + \"ms\"`,\r\n        '($.class._mobile)': `isMobileRes$`,\r\n    },\r\n})\r\nexport class TuiRootComponent {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        @Inject(TUI_ANIMATIONS_DURATION) readonly duration: number,\r\n        @Inject(TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES) readonly isMobileRes$: Observable<boolean>,,\r\n        @Inject(VERSION) readonly version: string\r\n    ) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin v14\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: `tui-root`,\r\n    templateUrl: `root.template.html`,\r\n    styleUrls: [`./root.style.less`],\r\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n    providers: [TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES_PROVIDER],\r\n    host: {\r\n        'data-tui-version': 'version',\r\n        '[style.--tui-duration]': `duration + \"ms\"`,\r\n        '($.class._mobile)': `isMobileRes$`,\r\n    },\r\n})\r\nexport class TuiRootComponent {\r\n    readonly duration: number = inject(TUI_ANIMATIONS_DURATION);\r\n    readonly isMobileRes$: Observable<boolean> = inject(TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES);\r\n    readonly version: string = inject(VERSION);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n\r\nin v14+\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: `tui-root`,\r\n    templateUrl: `root.template.html`,\r\n    styleUrls: [`./root.style.less`],\r\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n    providers: [TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES_PROVIDER],\r\n    host: {\r\n        'data-tui-version': inject(VERSION),\r\n        '[style.--tui-duration]': `${inject(TUI_ANIMATIONS_DURATION)}ms`,\r\n        '($.class._mobile)':  inject(TUI_IS_MOBILE_RES),\r\n    },\r\n})\r\nexport class TuiRootComponent {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\ninject can only be used in context, however, it creates an extra boilerplate","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47184","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support `inject` inside host\" (#47184)"},{"Id":"1342075571","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T08:54:13","Actor":"montella1507","Number":"47178","RawContent":null,"Title":"TypedForms - typing issue","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi i have serious issues with Typed forms and their typing of FormGroups, cannot make it work.

So if data to be transferred would change in this period, it'd be more safe doing a late serialization.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something or didn't I understand correctly how to add data to TransferState by using `onSerialize`?\r\n\r\nAnyway, as behavior now changed because of that \"empty store\" check I see this as a regession, which has to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nno TransferState data being added to SSR document\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNode : 16.14.2\r\nOS   : linux x64\r\nnpm  : 8.5.0\r\n\r\nnx : 14.5.4\r\n@nrwl/angular : 14.5.4\r\n\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/google-maps\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/localize\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-server\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"14.1.1\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47172","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Check for TransferState.isEmpty prevents serialization\" (#47172)"},{"Id":"1341538579","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-17T10:21:02","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"47170","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): post-review image directive cleanup","State":"open","Body":"Minor cleanups based on the review comments that were\r\nnot addressed after the initial review.\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47082#pullrequestreview-1074480563","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47170","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(common): post-review image directive cleanup\" (#47170)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1344060739","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-20T01:54:16","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23768","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: use same node version in bazel as CI","State":"closed","Body":"Versions should probably align?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23768","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: use same node version in bazel as CI\" (#23768)"},{"Id":"1344750793","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-19T17:58:08","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23770","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: prevent busting bazel analysis cache between build and test","State":"open","Body":"The first+last in the diff prevent busting the analysis cache between build+test.

Previously esbuild wasn't tested in this scenario, but this scenario now has test coverage. Getting this to work involved further tweaks to esbuild's custom code for what happens after Yarn PnP's path resolution algorithm runs, which is not currently covered by Yarn's PnP specification. These tweaks also fix `exports` map resolution with Yarn PnP for non-empty subpaths, which wasn't previously working.\n\n### [`v0.15.4`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0154)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.3...v0.15.4)\n\n-   Consider TypeScript import assignments to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;2468](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2468))\n\n    TypeScript has a [legacy import syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html#aliases) for working with TypeScript namespaces that looks like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    import { someNamespace } from './some-file'\n    import bar = someNamespace.foo;\n\n    // some-file.ts\n    export namespace someNamespace {\n      export let foo = 123\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Since esbuild converts TypeScript into JavaScript one file at a time, it doesn't know if `bar` is supposed to be a value or a type (or both, which TypeScript actually allows in this case). This is problematic because values are supposed to be kept during the conversion but types are supposed to be removed during the conversion. Currently esbuild keeps `bar` in the output, which is done because `someNamespace.foo` is a property access and property accesses run code that could potentially have a side effect (although there is no side effect in this case).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now consider `someNamespace.foo` to have no side effects. This means `bar` will now be removed when bundling and when tree shaking is enabled. Note that it will still not be removed when tree shaking is disabled. This is because in this mode, esbuild supports adding additional code to the end of the generated output that's in the same scope as the module. That code could potentially make use of `bar`, so it would be incorrect to remove it. If you want `bar` to be removed, you'll have to enable tree shaking (which tells esbuild that nothing else depends on the unexported top-level symbols in the generated output).\n\n-   Change the order of the banner and the `\"use strict\"` directive ([#&#8203;2467](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2467))\n\n    Previously the top of the file contained the following things in order:\n\n    1.  The hashbang comment (see below) from the source code, if present\n    2.  The `\"use strict\"` directive from the source code, if present\n    3.  The content of esbuild's `banner` API option, if specified\n\n    This was problematic for people that used the `banner` API option to insert the hashbang comment instead of using esbuild's hashbang comment preservation feature. So with this release, the order has now been changed to:\n\n    1.  The hashbang comment (see below) from the source code, if present\n    2.  The content of esbuild's `banner` API option, if specified\n    3.  The `\"use strict\"` directive from the source code, if present\n\n    I'm considering this change to be a bug fix instead of a breaking change because esbuild's documentation states that the `banner` API option can be used to \"insert an arbitrary string at the beginning of generated JavaScript files\". While this isn't technically true because esbuild may still insert the original hashbang comment before the banner, it's at least more correct now because the banner will now come before the `\"use strict\"` directive.\n\n    For context: JavaScript files recently allowed using a [hashbang comment](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang), which starts with `#!` and which must start at the very first character of the file. It allows Unix systems to execute the file directly as a script without needing to prefix it by the `node` command. This comment typically has the value `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Hashbang comments will be a part of ES2023 when it's released next year.\n\n-   Fix `exports` maps with Yarn PnP path resolution ([#&#8203;2473](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2473))\n\n    The Yarn PnP specification says that to resolve a package path, you first resolve it to the absolute path of a directory, and then you run node's module resolution algorithm on it. Previously esbuild followed this part of the specification. However, doing this means that `exports` in `package.json` is not respected because node's module resolution algorithm doesn't interpret `exports` for absolute paths. So with this release, esbuild will now use a modified algorithm that deviates from both specifications but that should hopefully behave more similar to what Yarn actually does: node's module resolution algorithm is run with the original import path but starting from the directory returned by Yarn PnP.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.6.2`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1362-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1361v1362-2022-08-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.6.1...v13.6.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   linting ([#&#8203;187](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/187)) ([cf1c5ed](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/cf1c5ed47810d98568cfdbd2c4b06b51e6fccd32))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I think I understand the intent here, but I believe the `singleRun` scenario was overlooked. When running in watch mode, it's true that you always want Karma to start up and the exit code of the command is irrelevant, since the command runs until the user forces it to stop. But within CICD systems `singleRun` is the norm and the exit code is very important. We do not want karma to start if the compilation fails and the command should exit with a non zero code.\r\n\r\nI think all that is required is to add a reject handler and call that one instead it there are errors `&& singleRun`. I have verified this fix locally and will open a PR with precisely this change against this issue.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate an Angular project using ng cli 13.2.3 or above.\r\n\r\nCreate one unit test. Include a compilation error in the test.\r\n\r\nEnsure the karma option `failOnEmptyTestSuite` is `false`.\r\n\r\nRun `ng test --project=<project-name> --watch=false`\r\n\r\nObserve that karma starts despite the compilation error and the command exits with success (0 code).\r\n\r\nThis is all captured in the following reproduction repo: https://github.com/vigie/false-positive-repo-app\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.8\r\nNode: 14.20.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.17\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.8\r\nng-packagr                      13.3.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\nwebpack                         5.73.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this was introduced at v13.2.3 and as far as I can tell still exists in latest v14.

But with Yarn's `enableGlobalCache` setting it's possible to configure Yarn PnP's implementation to reach outside of the directory subtree containing the Yarn PnP manifest. This was causing esbuild to fail to bundle projects with the `enableGlobalCache` setting enabled.\n\n    To handle this case, *esbuild will now only search for the Yarn PnP manifest in the current working directory of the esbuild process*. If you're using esbuild's CLI, this means you will now have to `cd` into the appropriate directory first. If you're using esbuild's API, you can override esbuild's value for the current working directory with the `absWorkingDir` API option.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP resolution failures due to backslashes in paths on Windows ([#&#8203;2462](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2462))\n\n    Previously dependencies of a Yarn PnP virtual dependency failed to resolve on Windows. This was because Windows uses `\\` instead of `/` as a path separator, and the path manipulation algorithms used for Yarn PnP expected `/`. This release converts `\\` into `/` in Windows paths, which fixes this issue.\n\n-   Fix `sideEffects` patterns containing slashes on Windows ([#&#8203;2465](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2465))\n\n    The `sideEffects` field in `package.json` lets you specify an array of patterns to mark which files have side effects (which causes all other files to be considered to not have side effects by exclusion). That looks like this:\n\n    ```json\n    \"sideEffects\": [\n      \"**/index.js\",\n      \"**/index.prod.js\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    However, the presence of the `/` character in the pattern meant that the pattern failed to match Windows-style paths, which broke `sideEffects` on Windows in this case. This release fixes this problem by adding additional code to handle Windows-style paths.\n\n### [`v0.15.2`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0152)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.1...v0.15.2)\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP issue with packages containing `index.js` ([#&#8203;2455](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2455), [#&#8203;2461](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2461))\n\n    Yarn PnP's tests require the resolved paths to end in `/`. That's not how the rest of esbuild's internals work, however, and doing this messed up esbuild's node module path resolution regarding automatically-detected `index.js` files. Previously packages that relied on implicit `index.js` resolution rules didn't work with esbuild under Yarn PnP. Removing this slash has fixed esbuild's path resolution behavior regarding `index.js`, which should now the same both with and without Yarn PnP.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;2456](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2456))\n\n    Previously using `extends` in `tsconfig.json` with a path in a Yarn PnP package didn't work. This is because the process of setting up package path resolution rules requires parsing `tsconfig.json` files (due to the `baseUrl` and `paths` features) and resolving `extends` to a package path requires package path resolution rules to already be set up, which is a circular dependency. This cycle is broken by using special rules for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` that bypasses esbuild's normal package path resolution process. This is why using `extends` with a Yarn PnP package didn't automatically work. With this release, these special rules have been modified to check for a Yarn PnP manifest so this case should work now.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support in `esbuild-wasm` ([#&#8203;2458](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2458))\n\n    When running esbuild via WebAssembly, Yarn PnP support previously failed because Go's file system internals return `EINVAL` when trying to read a `.zip` file as a directory when run with WebAssembly. This was unexpected because Go's file system internals return `ENOTDIR` for this case on native. This release updates esbuild to treat `EINVAL` like `ENOTDIR` in this case, which fixes using `esbuild-wasm` to bundle a Yarn PnP project.\n\n    Note that to be able to use `esbuild-wasm` for Yarn PnP successfully, you currently have to run it using `node` instead of `yarn node`. This is because the file system shim that Yarn overwrites node's native file system API with currently generates invalid file descriptors with negative values when inside a `.zip` file. This prevents esbuild from working correctly because Go's file system internals don't expect syscalls that succeed without an error to return an invalid file descriptor. Yarn is working on fixing their use of invalid file descriptors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.22.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.22.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.21.0...v8.22.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`2b97607`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2b97607675e1d0920a3abedd736e2ae00ed26d52) feat: Implement caching for FlatESLint ([#&#8203;16190](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16190)) (Nicholas C.

This included whitespace nodes used for formatting.\r\n2. **Redundant Attribute:** `ngProjectAs` was being added to both the special `projectAs` field (serialized as `AttributeMarker.ProjectAs`) and the standard attributes list, causing a redundant `ngprojectas` attribute at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Updated `ingestControlFlowInsertionPoint` in `ingest.ts` to skip whitespace-only text nodes.\r\n- Modified `ConstCollection` in `const_collection.ts` to prevent adding `ngProjectAs` to the standard attributes list.\r\n- Added a new compliance test case covering `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch`.\r\n\r\n## Verification Results\r\n- Verified that attributes (including `ngProjectAs`) now correctly bubble up to the control flow block's create instruction even with whitespace in the template.\r\n- Verified that `ngProjectAs` is correctly serialized in the constant pool without being duplicated as a literal attribute.\r\n- Compliance test case `ng_project_as_control_flow.ts` successfully demonstrates the fix.\r\n\r\nFixes #59398\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66660","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler): handle whitespace in control flow attribute bubbling\" (#66660)"},{"Id":"3835501159","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T21:17:40","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"66671","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Handle additional description format","State":"open","Body":"Ex: https://angular.dev/api/router/withExperimentalPlatformNavigation\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66671","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): Handle additional description format\" (#66671)"},{"Id":"3835484881","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T21:12:27","Actor":"atscott","Number":"66670","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(language-server): split session into separate handlers","State":"open","Body":"Breaks up the large session.ts file into separate handlers and consolidates the code related to completions in the server into the handler file\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66670","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(language-server): split session into separate handlers\" (#66670)"},{"Id":"3835460154","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T21:05:35","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"66669","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): @for view reuse","State":"open","Body":"@for block not remount child component relative to ngFor (old directive)\r\n\r\nFix #66658\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

When enabled, the extension registers a FileSystemWatcher for .ts, .html, and package.json files and forwards events to the server. The server completely disables its internal native file watchers (via a new 'ServerHost' implementation that stubs watchFile/watchDirectory).\r\n\r\nThis is significantly more performant and reliable than native watching for several reasons:\r\n- Deduplication: VS Code already watches the workspace. Piggybacking on these events prevents the server from duplicating thousands of file watchers.\r\n- OS Limits: Since the server opens zero watcher handles, it is impossible to hit OS limits (ENOSPC), no matter how large the repo is.\r\n- Optimization: VS Code's watcher uses highly optimized native implementations (like Parcel Watcher in Rust/C++) which handle recursive directory watching far better than Node.js's 'fs.watch'.\r\n- Debouncing: The client aggregates extremely frequent file events (e.g., during 'git checkout'), reducing the flood of processing requests to the server.\r\n\r\nThis option was tested in one very large internal project and observed ~10-50x improvement of initialization times.\r\n\r\nfixes #66543\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66668","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(language-server): Support client-side file watching via `onDidCh…\" (#66668)"},{"Id":"3835306331","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T20:23:03","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"66667","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix wrong line highlights","State":"open","Body":"Corrects incorrect line highlighting in code examples so the highlighted lines match the intended sections being explained.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

We use `initialNavigation: 'enabledBlocking'` to ensure SSR route guards (e.g., CMS page guards) complete before server-side render.\nWe encourage users to enable non-destructive hydration for SSR (with `provideClientHydration(withEventReplay(), withNoHttpTransferCache())`).\nWe have been running enabledBlocking + non-destructive hydration since May 2025 and have not observed degradation or functional issues so far.The new diagnostic in Angular 21 (NG05001) has introduced confusion for our community and library users, because it implies the configuration is invalid, but we haven’t observed issues yet.\n**References**:\n\t• Angular issue: Show warning when `withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation` Is used with `provideClientHydration` #59624\n\t• Angular PR: feat(platform-browser): Warns on conflicting hydration and blocking #62963\n\t• Please note: These threads are closed/locked, so we’re opening a new issue to ask for guidance.\n\n### Questions\n• What practical, user-facing negative consequences should we expect?\n• Are there known failure scenarios, rendering glitches, missed navigations, or hydration mismatches we should anticipate?\n• What was the rationale for NG05001 declaring this combination contradictory?\n• Is the warning primarily defensive (to steer toward recommended defaults), or does it indicate a known incompatibility?\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nDocumentation on whether enabledBlocking + non-destructive hydration is supported, tolerated, or discouraged and why. \nA list of practical consequences/known issues to monitor or tests to add.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe warning message is being ignored because it has not shown any observable effect on our daily operations.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66652","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Practical consequences of using enabledBlocking with non-destructive hydration (Angular 21 NG05001)\" (#66652)"},{"Id":"3834703859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T18:03:37","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"66657","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [21.1.x]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular adev cross repo docs files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66657","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [21.1.x]\" (#66657)"},{"Id":"3834700968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T18:02:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"66656","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [main]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular adev cross repo docs files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66656","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update cross-repo adev docs [main]\" (#66656)"},{"Id":"3834765453","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T17:44:35","Actor":"andreimokrousov","Number":"66658","RawContent":null,"Title":"track function in @for is ignored on in-place element modifications","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI've noticed that if I specify specific property in the track expression, angular doesn't remount child element when this property changes in-place (i.e. object ref doesn't change).\nHowever, `ngFor` remount such element, which is expected.\n\nHere's the minimal example, which can be tried at https://angular.dev/playground\n```ts\nimport {Input, Output, Component, EventEmitter} from '@angular/core';\nimport {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgFor} from '@angular/common';\n\ninterface ListItem {\n  name: string;\n}\n@Component({\n  selector: 's-item',\n  template: `<div>magic: {{magic}}, name: {{data.name}} <button (click)=\"changeName.emit(data)\">change name</button></div>`,\n  styles: 'div{padding:4px;display: flex;justify-content:space-between}'\n})\nexport class Item {\n  magic = '';\n  \n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.magic = Math.random().toString(36).slice(3);\n  }\n  \n  @Input({required: true}) data: ListItem = {name: 'qqq'};\n  @Output() changeName = new EventEmitter<ListItem>();\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `\n  <h2>&#64;for</h2>\n  @for(item of items;track item.name) { \n     <s-item [data]=\"item\" (changeName)=\"changeName($event)\"/> \n  }\n  <h2>ngFor</h2>\n  \n  <s-item \n    *ngFor=\"let item of items2;

This would help prevent confusion and incorrect implementations based on the current guidance.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/forms/signals/model-design#form-model-to-domain-model\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66647","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[signal forms] Documentation example for domain ↔ form model mapping creates a reactive loop\" (#66647)"},{"Id":"3833022782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T10:13:31","Actor":"u-mikhalenka","Number":"66646","RawContent":null,"Title":"[signal forms]: debounceForDuration does not resolve its Promise on abort, causing pending awaits","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe current implementation of debounceForDuration does not resolve or reject the returned Promise when the associated AbortSignal is aborted ([source](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5d46554e3fe8b64c5fefc7a8ce891c179741977e/packages/forms/signals/src/api/rules/debounce.ts#L44)).\n\nAs a result, callers awaiting this Promise may remain suspended indefinitely. In particular, debounceSync awaits debounceForDuration ([source](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5d46554e3fe8b64c5fefc7a8ce891c179741977e/packages/forms/signals/src/field/node.ts#L324)), and if the debounce is aborted, the await never resolves.\n\nThis can lead to:\n- async execution paths that never complete\n- retention of async stack frames and captured variables\n- potentially increased memory usage in long-running or frequently triggered scenarios\n\nResolving the Promise on abort would avoid this issue. This should be safe, as debounceSync already checks `controller.signal.aborted` before performing the sync operation, so resolving early would not change observable behavior—only ensure proper completion of the async flow.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.5\nNode.js           : 24.13.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.6.2\nOperating System  : darwin arm64\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66646","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[signal forms]: debounceForDuration does not resolve its Promise on abort, causing pending awaits\" (#66646)"},{"Id":"3832215761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-20T06:13:26","Actor":"damiansire","Number":"66645","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(adev): fix Genkit documentation URL","State":"open","Body":"Update the Genkit Angular integration documentation link from the old path /docs/angular/ to the current correct path /docs/frameworks/angular/\r\n\r\nThis ensures developers are directed to the correct and up-to-date documentation for integrating Genkit with Angular applications.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

requires `webpack@5.104`). The error message is one of the following, according to the strategy of dependencies' sharing adopted (`shareAll` or `share`, you can find more into the [webpack configuration](https://github.com/leo2823/ng-mfe-issue/blob/main/webpack.config.js) of the reproduction example):\n\n- **TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null**\n- **TypeError: (0 , c.bootstrapApplication) is not a function**\n\n\n`webpack@5.104` introduced some changes into the `concatenateModules` optimization option that seem to cause this error. I tested the [webpack configuration](https://github.com/leo2823/ng-mfe-issue/blob/main/webpack.config.js) disabling this option and no error was thrown. However, I cannot reproduce the same errors in other module federation's examples (e.g react example), so I suspect it's an integration problem between Webpack's Module Federation and @angular-devkit/build-angular _browser_ builder.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/leo2823/ng-mfe-issue\nSteps:\n\n1. Run `npm i`\n2.

which this bug was not present was\n\n21.0\n\n### Description\n\nWith the latest v21.1.0 version, it's now impossible to run unit-test with vitest when there is scss assets in ng-package.json\nWhen running the command `ng test`, the CLI will stop with error\n```\nError: The {scss file listed in ng-package.json} asset path must start with the project source root.

21.1](https://github.com/JulienMichelFr/repro-angular-library-vitest-bug/tree/v21.1)\n\nYou just have to install and then run `ng test ui`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nAn exception occurred

This adapter enables Material datepicker to work with Temporal (native or polyfilled) without relying on JS `Date` as the internal model. The implementation follows patterns from existing adapters in this repo, especially `NativeDateAdapter`.\r\n\r\n## Scope / what’s in this PR\r\n- **Unified adapter**: `TemporalDateAdapter` (The primary 3-in-1 adapter recommended for general use). Supports switching modes via configuration:\r\n  - `date` → `Temporal.PlainDate`\r\n  - `datetime` → `Temporal.PlainDateTime`\r\n  - `zoned` → `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`\r\n- **Demonstration / Split adapters**: A set of 4 additional adapters illustrating different architectural splittings and strict type handling. These serve as architectural examples:\r\n  - `PlainDateAdapter`: Strictly for `Temporal.PlainDate`.\r\n  - `PlainDateTimeAdapter`: Strictly for `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.\r\n  - `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`: Strictly for `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`.\r\n  - `PlainTemporalAdapter`: A hybrid handling both `PlainDate` and `PlainDateTime`.\r\n- **Formatting** uses `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` with Temporal’s locale formatting.\r\n- **No runtime dependency** is added; consumers supply a Temporal implementation (native or polyfill).\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n### Unified adapter (`TemporalDateAdapter` / `MatTemporalDateAdapterOptions`)\r\n**Defaults**\r\n- `calendar`: `iso8601`\r\n- `outputCalendar`: same as `calendar`\r\n- `mode`: `date`\r\n- `overflow`: `reject`\r\n- `timezone`: system timezone (only when `mode: 'zoned'`)\r\n- `disambiguation`, `offset`, `rounding`: Temporal defaults (only when `mode: 'zoned'`)\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\n- `calendar`: calendar system to use for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar`: calendar system to use for output/formatting when different from calculations (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDate/withCalendar, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/withCalendar).\r\n- `mode`: `date | datetime | zoned`.\r\n- `timezone` (zoned only): IANA ID like `Europe/Warsaw` or `UTC`.\r\n- `disambiguation` (zoned only): `'compatible' | 'earlier' | 'later' | 'reject'` for DST gaps/overlaps (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDateTime/toZonedDateTime, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `offset` (zoned only): `'use' | 'ignore' | 'reject' | 'prefer'` for offset ambiguity on parse (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `rounding` (zoned only): `{smallestUnit, roundingIncrement?, roundingMode?}` applied to zoned output (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/round).\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek`: overrides the locale-derived week start.\r\n- `overflow`: `reject` throws on invalid dates, `constrain` clamps to the nearest valid date.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n- `outputCalendar` uses `withCalendar` for display fields only; it does not re-resolve the instant, so `disambiguation`/`offset` are not applied during output conversion.\r\n- If `disambiguation`, `offset`, or `rounding` aren’t provided, the adapter relies on Temporal’s defaults.\r\n- `overflow` defaults to `reject` to avoid silent clamping and better match strict validation expectations.\r\n\r\n### Split adapters\r\n**`PlainTemporalAdapterOptions`** (for `PlainTemporalAdapter`)\r\n- `mode` (default: `datetime`): `date` → `PlainDate`, `datetime` → `PlainDateTime`.\r\n- `calendar` (default: `iso8601`): calendar system for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar` (default: same as `calendar`): calendar system for output/formatting.\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek` (default: locale-derived): overrides the locale-derived week start.\r\n- `overflow` (default: `reject`): `reject` throws on invalid dates, `constrain` clamps.\r\n\r\n**`ZonedDateTimeAdapterOptions`** (for `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`)\r\n- `calendar` (default: `iso8601`): calendar system for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar` (default: same as `calendar`): calendar system for output/formatting (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/withCalendar).\r\n- `timezone` (default: system timezone): IANA ID like `Europe/Warsaw` or `UTC`.\r\n- `disambiguation`: `'compatible' | 'earlier' | 'later' | 'reject'` for DST gaps/overlaps (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDateTime/toZonedDateTime, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `offset`: `'use' | 'ignore' | 'reject' | 'prefer'` for offset ambiguity on parse (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `rounding`: `{smallestUnit, roundingIncrement?, roundingMode?}` applied to zoned output (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/round).\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek` (default: locale-derived): overrides the locale-derived week start.\r\n- `overflow` (default: `reject`): `reject` throws on invalid dates, `constrain` clamps.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Unified adapter option examples\r\n- `calendar`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date', calendar: 'japanese'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2024-01-15').withCalendar('japanese');\r\n  // Output example: adapter.format(value, {year: 'numeric'}) -> (Japanese era year, locale-dependent)\r\n  ```\r\n  → display and calculations use the Japanese calendar.\r\n- `outputCalendar`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date', calendar: 'iso8601', outputCalendar: 'japanese'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2024-01-15');\r\n  // Output example: adapter.format(value, {year: 'numeric'}) -> (Japanese era year, locale-dependent)\r\n  ```\r\n  → calculations use ISO, output uses the Japanese calendar.\r\n- `mode`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'datetime'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:30');\r\n  // Output examples:\r\n  // mode: 'date'    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15\r\n  // mode: 'datetime'-> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15\r\n  // mode: 'zoned'   -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  ```\r\n  → values are `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.\r\n- `timezone`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:30[UTC]');\r\n  // Output example: adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  ```\r\n  → zoned values in UTC.\r\n- `disambiguation`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'America/New_York', disambiguation: 'later'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2024-11-03T01:05').toZonedDateTime('America/New_York', {\r\n    disambiguation: 'later',\r\n  });\r\n  // Output examples (same local time):\r\n  // compatible -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-11-03T01:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]\r\n  // earlier    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-11-03T01:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]\r\n  // later      -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-11-03T01:05:00-05:00[America/New_York]\r\n  // reject     -> adapter.setTime(...) throws for ambiguous/nonexistent time\r\n  ```\r\n  → ambiguous times choose the later instant.\r\n- `offset`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', offset: 'ignore'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2019-12-23T12:00:00-02:00[America/Sao_Paulo]', {\r\n    offset: 'ignore',\r\n  });\r\n  // Output examples (same input string):\r\n  // use    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T11:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // ignore -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T12:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // prefer -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T12:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // reject -> adapter.deserialize(...) -> invalid\r\n  ```\r\n  → keep local time when offset conflicts with zone on parse.\r\n- `rounding`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', rounding: {smallestUnit: 'minute', roundingIncrement: 5}});\r\n  const value = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:34:56[UTC]');\r\n  // Output examples (roundingMode):\r\n  // halfExpand -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:35:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // floor      -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // ceil       -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:35:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // trunc      -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  ```\r\n  → outputs rounded to 5-minute steps.\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({firstDayOfWeek: 1});\r\n  // Output example: adapter.getFirstDayOfWeek() -> 1\r\n  ```\r\n  → weeks start on Monday.\r\n- `overflow`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({overflow: 'reject'});\r\n  // Output example (reject): adapter.createDate(2024, 1, 31) -> throws\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({overflow: 'constrain'});\r\n  // Output example (constrain): adapter.createDate(2024, 1, 31) -> 2024-02-29\r\n  ```\r\n  → invalid dates throw; invalid dates clamp.\r\n\r\n**Form control example (overflow)**\r\n```ts\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date', overflow: 'constrain'});\r\nconst control = new FormControl(Temporal.PlainDate.from({year: 2024, month: 2, day: 31}));\r\n```\r\nEffect: the value is clamped to the last valid day of the month (e.g. 2024-02-29) instead of throwing.\r\n\r\n### Split adapter option examples\r\n```ts\r\nprovidePlainTemporalAdapter({mode: 'date', calendar: 'iso8601', outputCalendar: 'japanese'});\r\nprovideZonedDateTimeAdapter({timezone: 'UTC', disambiguation: 'reject', rounding: {smallestUnit: 'minute'}});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n```ts\r\nimport {provideTemporalDateAdapter} from '@angular/material-temporal-adapter';\r\n\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date'});\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'datetime'});\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned'}); // default: system timezone\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport {\r\n  providePlainTemporalAdapter,\r\n  provideZonedDateTimeAdapter,\r\n} from

'Europe/Warsaw'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration patterns\r\n- **From `NativeDateAdapter` (`Date`)**: switch to `mode: 'date'`, replace `Date` with `Temporal.PlainDate`. If you rely on timezone/time-of-day behavior, use `mode: 'zoned'` with the system timezone instead.\r\n- **From `MomentDateAdapter`/`LuxonDateAdapter` (date+time)**: use `mode: 'datetime'`, replace values with `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.\r\n- **From timezone-aware usage**: use `mode: 'zoned'` + `timezone`, replace values with `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`.\r\n- **From Luxon `defaultOutputCalendar`**: keep `calendar` for calculations, set `outputCalendar` for display.\r\n- **From apps relying on DST/offset rules or rounding**: configure `disambiguation`, `offset`, and `rounding` in `zoned` mode.\r\n- **Incremental/explicit type choice**: use split adapters (`PlainTemporalAdapter` or `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`).\r\n- If a Temporal polyfill is needed, load it before bootstrapping the app.\r\n- If you provide custom `MAT_DATE_FORMATS`, ensure they are `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (Temporal ignores parse formats and parses ISO strings only).\r\n\r\n**Custom display formats**\r\n```ts\r\nimport {MatDateFormats} from '@angular/material/core';\r\nimport {provideTemporalDateAdapter, MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS} from '@angular/material-temporal-adapter';\r\n\r\nconst MY_TEMPORAL_FORMATS = {\r\n  ...MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS,\r\n  display: {\r\n    ...MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS.display,\r\n    dateInput: {year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric'},\r\n  },\r\n} satisfies MatDateFormats;\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [provideTemporalDateAdapter(MY_TEMPORAL_FORMATS, {mode: 'date'})],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**MAT token notes**\r\n- `MAT_DATE_LOCALE`: locale string used for formatting and week info.\r\n- `MAT_DATE_FORMATS`: must be `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (parse formats ignored).\r\n\r\n## Comparison and mapping\r\n- Follows the same `DateAdapter` contract as `NativeDateAdapter`, `MomentDateAdapter`, `LuxonDateAdapter`, and `DateFnsAdapter`.\r\n- Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` for display formatting (like `NativeDateAdapter`), but the backing values are Temporal types instead of `Date`.\r\n\r\n**Option mapping (approximate)**\r\n| Existing adapter | Option | Temporal equivalent | Notes |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| NativeDateAdapter | n/a | `mode: 'date'` | Temporal `PlainDate` is the closest analogue to `Date` for date-only use. |\r\n| MomentDateAdapter | `useUtc: true` | `mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'` | Use zoned+UTC for UTC-centric workflows. |\r\n| MomentDateAdapter | `strict: true` | `overflow: 'reject'` | Temporal parsing is ISO-only; `overflow` controls invalid date creation. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `useUtc: true` | `mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'` | Similar UTC behavior. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `firstDayOfWeek` | `firstDayOfWeek` | Same semantics. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `defaultOutputCalendar` | `outputCalendar` | Calendar used for output/formatting (calculations use `calendar`). |\r\n| DateFnsAdapter | n/a | `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` + `MAT_DATE_FORMATS` | Temporal adapter also uses locale + formats. |\r\n\r\n## Notable design choices / dilemmas (with resolution)\r\n### 1) Temporal typings source (TypeScript not shipping them yet)\r\nTypeScript does not currently ship `lib.esnext.temporal` in the version used here, so this PR includes local declarations to type the adapter until the repo upgrades to a TS version that includes Temporal libs.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/62628\r\n\r\n### 2) API Extractor goldens\r\nAPI Extractor had trouble resolving the global `Temporal` namespace in this setup. Additionally, existing adapter packages (moment/luxon/date-fns) don’t have API goldens. For consistency and to avoid introducing a blocked/flaky step, this PR does not add API golden coverage for this adapter package.\r\n\r\n### 3) Formatting implementation note\r\n`Intl.DateTimeFormat` is used for localization (same overall approach as other adapters). Zoned values are formatted using the configured timezone.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- Unit tests cover all `mode` variants and timezone behavior, plus creation/parsing/formatting/time operations.\r\n- Latest run: `pnpm test src/material-temporal-adapter --no-watch` on Chromium (local).\r\n  - Result: 141 passed, 2 skipped (Islamic calendar suite skipped because `islamic` calendar is not supported by the current Temporal implementation).\r\n- Note: split adapters (`PlainTemporalAdapter`, `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`) are not explicitly covered by a dedicated spec yet.\r\n\r\n## Open questions (feedback requested)\r\n1) Calendar type: keep `calendar` as `string` (max flexibility) vs trying to constrain it (risk of being incomplete/locale-dependent).\r\n2) Positioning: should this adapter be documented as “ready” like other adapters, or called out as “early” given current ecosystem support for Temporal?\r\n3) Should `mode` be required for the unified adapter (no implicit default), or keep the default `date` mode?\r\n4) Should `overflow` default to `reject` (strict) or align with Temporal’s `constrain` default?\r\n5) Should we add migration examples to the public docs (datepicker/timepicker) instead of only in the PR description?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32668","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-temporal-adapter): add Temporal API date adapter\" (#32668)"},{"Id":"3823769690","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T21:43:57","Actor":"OmerGronich","Number":"32664","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(aria/spinbutton): Add spinbutton primitive for value selection within discrete ranges","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAngular Aria currently lacks a spinbutton primitive. \nThe [APG Spinbutton Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/) defines it as an input widget that restricts its value to a set or range of discrete values.\n\n### Keyboard Interaction (per APG)\n| Key | Function |                                                                                          \n  |-----|----------|                                                                                          \n| Up Arrow | Increases the value |                                                                          \n| Down Arrow | Decreases the value |                                                                        \n| Home | Sets value to minimum (if defined) |                                                               \n| End | Sets value to maximum (if defined) |                                                                \n| Page Up | Increases value by larger step (optional) |                                                     \n| Page Down | Decreases value by larger step (optional) |                                                   \n\n### Required ARIA Attributes\n- `role=\"spinbutton\"` on the focusable element\n- `aria-valuenow` -

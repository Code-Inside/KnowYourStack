Currently if a component template has `NgTemplateOutlet` while the respective `component.imports` array is missing the import of the directive, the app compiles successfully and the app might have a leaking issue that might only be caught during QA testing at runtime (supposing the respective existing component does not have properly test). I would rather expect the app to compile-time fail as it does when the aforementioned template is using something like `NgClass` while the respective import is missing, as this will yield `NG8002` in case of missing `NgClass` import.\n\n```\n\nimport { NgClass } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [NgClass],\n  template: `\n    <!--Remove the import of NgTemplateOutlet and the compilation will succeed-->\n    <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"ref\"/>\n    <ng-template #ref> <h1>can you make me fail during app compilation with NG0303 as I am compiling successfully ?</h1> </ng-template>\n\n  <!--Remove the import of NgClass and the compilation will fail-->\n  <h1 [ngClass]=\"show ? 'blue' : 'default'\">Missing NgClass will yield NG8002 </h1>\n  `,\n  styles: [`\n    .blue {\n      color: blue; \n    }\n    .default {\n      color: black;\n    }\n  `]\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'repro';\n  show = true; \n}\n```\n\nRepo: https://github.com/bougwal/NG0303 \n\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n\nI am thus, asking for: \n- The potential improvement of making `NG0303` compile time failure if there are no blockers/concerns. \n- The addition of `NG0303` to the error encyclopaedia, as I don't see it logged on ADEV neither under runtime nor under compile time:   https://angular.dev/errors. Is there a reason to exclude it? \n\nLet me know if I am missing smth I have to add / I look forward to the input / more context on this ! \n\nMany thanks guys ! \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nn/a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Document NG0303 diagnostic when an unknown binding is present in a template\" (#59488)"},{"Id":"2782298303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-12T05:38:20","Actor":"kai1992cool","Number":"59487","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Resource and rxResource","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIntroduce the ability to pause/stop/resume, the resource and rxResource, so that we can temporarily pause/resume the listener for signal changes.\n\nWe can use `.destroy()` but the data using this resource is also removed, so I am asking for `stop` feature, so that we can maintain the data that is present inside the resource.\n\n[How to run function just one time when 2 signals have value?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79344955/how-to-run-function-just-one-time-when-2-signals-have-value/79345028#79345028) \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce the ability to pause/stop/resume, the resource and rxResource, so that we can temporarily pause/resume the listener for signal changes.\n\nWe can use `.destroy()` but the data using this resource is also removed, so I am asking for `stop` feature, so that we can pause the resource listener.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNothing","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59487","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Resource and rxResource\" (#59487)"},{"Id":"2782281509","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-12T04:33:09","Actor":"hannah23280","Number":"59486","RawContent":null,"Title":"More options for Dependency Injection (e.g Method and Class field DI)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nI came to realize that Angular inject() seems to be equivalent to traditional lookup feature used in backend (e.g JNDI lookup). When i learn Spring (Java based framework) long time back, online articles seem to indicate that Dependency injection is a newer approach that is generally more flexible and easier to use than dependency lookup.  Hence, not sure will the usage of inject function in Angular  implies a backward trend.\n\n\nI raise this for awareness and hope to throw a stone out to attract the jade\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nShould we also explore other options for dependency injection (such as method and class field DI) atop the current constructor DI.   I am not implying inject function (which is equivalent to lookup) should be thrown away, but rather provide more options for DI \n\nGetting aspiration from Spring (Java based framework), can consider introduce an annotation such as @Autowired, that allow us to use it to annotate a method containing parameter that expects an injected instance.  Whenever the component is instantiated, the method annotated with @Autowired is automatically called, with the correct instance passed in by the angular framework. \n\nSuch annotation can also be used directly on class fields.\n\nOne advantage i can think of , is that when we unit test the @Autowired annotated class method, we can just simply pass in a mocked object as argument to the method.

The other properties are bound to various different control properties, e.g., <input [value]=\"model.wbsNumber\" ...>.\n\napp-field-dropdown and app-field-text-input are components that implement ControlValueAccessor and wrap existing HTML elements like selects or inputs and add additional functionality. The value property on app-field-text-input is just a passthrough to the value property on the underlying input control.\n\nIf the @Input value to the component changes and triggers the code in ngOnChanges to retrieve a new model from the server and the model.editable property changes, e.g., from true to false or vice versa, I seem to have binding issues where control values are not being updated and reflecting the correct values, i.e., model.wbsNumber is not being set on the input control. This doesn't happen if the model.editable property does not change when ngOnChanges is triggered. The values are updated correctly in the ui.\n\nI'm sure it has to do with dynamic control construction due to the @if, but I am at a loss as to why it does not work and how to get it so that the controls reflect the correct values in the ui.\n\nOne thing that helps the display as part of the first @if condition, i.e., model?.editable, is if I change this.ngModelGroup.reset(this.model) to setTimeout(() => this.ngModelGroup.reset(this.model), 50) for some reason. But this doesn't work for the @else condition because those controls are just one-way data-bound through the value properties.  So the setTimeout call is hinting at something, but I don't know what.\n\n```\n@if (model?.editable) {\n<ng-container ngModelGroup=\"wbs\">\n    <app-field-dropdown #wbsProgram\n                        id=\"project-wbs-wbsProgramId\"\n                        name=\"wbsProgramId\"\n                        [field]=\"PMBField.ProjectSummaryProgram\"\n                        [required]=\"true\"\n                        [options]=\"wbsPrograms\"\n                        (change)=\"getWbsChildren(wbsProgram.name)\"\n                        ngModel />\n\n   <!--Other controls-->\n</ng-container>\n}\n@else {\n<app-field-text-input id=\"project-wbs-wbsProgramName\"\n                      [field]=\"PMBField.ProjectSummaryProgram\"\n                      [readonly]=\"true\"\n                      [value]=\"model?.wbsProgramName\" />\n\n<!--Other controls-->\n}\n\n```\n\n    @ViewChild(NgModelGroup) ngModelGroup: NgModelGroup | undefined;\n\n    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n        if (changes[\"projectId\"]?.previousValue !== this.projectId) {\n            if (this.projectId) {\n                this._projectWbsService.getProjectWbs({ request: this.projectId.id }).subscribe(response => {\n                    this.model = response;\n                    if (this.model.editable) {\n                        // Other code...\n\n                        this.ngModelGroup?.reset(this.model);\n                       // Mostly works if I replace above with:\n                       setTimeout(() => this.ngModelGroup?.reset(this.model), 50);\n                   }\n            });\n            } else {\n                this.model = undefined;\n                // Other code...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59478","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@if @else (or *ngIf) issue and change detection\" (#59478)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2785894033","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-14T01:14:43","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29345","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): warn when using both `isolatedModules` and `emitDecoratorMetadata`","State":"open","Body":"If both the `isolatedModules` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` Typescript options are enabled within a project, a warning will now be issued explaining that not all metadata may be emitting for each decorator.

Go to DevTools -> Memory -> Heap Snapshot\n2. Take a heap snapshot\n3. Click **Get Data** several times\n4. Take a heap snapshot\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4\n6. Compare heap snapshots\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOld `Node` objects must be collected by GC. The memory heap should contain only those objects that are present in the tree.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`Node` objects are never collected by GC. The size of the memory heap groves over time as node objects accumulate in memory.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77baa69a-3bf5-467f-97f4-837471c9a504)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.5\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.5\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.205 (Official Build) (64-bit)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Tree): Memory leak on data source changes\" (#30322)"},{"Id":"2785256512","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T20:07:25","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"30321","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/schematics): Add option to customize colors for neutral variant and error palettes","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #29969","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30321","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/schematics): Add option to customize colors for neutral variant and error palettes\" (#30321)"},{"Id":"2785123244","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T19:28:35","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"30320","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/button): Remove unused inject.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30320","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(material/button): Remove unused inject.\" (#30320)"},{"Id":"2784996181","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T18:49:44","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30319","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): active vs inactive tick mark count","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30319","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): active vs inactive tick mark count\" (#30319)"},{"Id":"2780876414","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T18:24:47","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"30305","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/table): Optimize expensive css selector","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30305","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(material/table): Optimize expensive css selector\" (#30305)"},{"Id":"2784438304","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T17:40:30","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30317","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(material/slider): Ensure tick marks are rendered correctly","State":"closed","Body":"* This is just some prep work for a set of incoming changes to the slider tick marks","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30317","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(material/slider): Ensure tick marks are rendered correctly\" (#30317)"},{"Id":"2784438708","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T15:58:09","Actor":"richardsengers","Number":"30318","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Button): container shape override not working + update docs","State":"open","Body":"\n### Description\n\nWhen setting a container shape like medium or small, the layout off the button is a square\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd142c8e-ab71-4266-abe8-8e2e30e9484a)\n\nFrom [m3]( https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/shape-scale-tokens#c8789a44-609b-41d3-832c-0f19c18133c0) site:\nFor example, by default, buttons are mapped to the shape style “full.” If your product requires a smaller amount of roundedness, it can be remapped to the small or medium style in shape scale.\n\nI think the docs should also be updated so we know which button type has which setting (is the raised button the protected-* setting?)\nAnd offcourse which settings we can use.

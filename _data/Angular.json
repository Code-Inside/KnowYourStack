In short, we have several library-like modules that are consumed by the main app. These modules sometimes depend on the same packages used by the main Angular application, and we want to avoid installing duplicate dependencies within each module.\n\nTo achieve this, we use the **path configuration** in the `tsconfig.json` file to reference the packages from the main application directly.\n\nI have also checked these issues, however those did not help:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27495\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nYou can find a minimal reproducible example here [path-config-problem](https://github.com/sumeyyeKurtulus/path-config-problem)\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nERROR Error: NG0203: The `EnvironmentInjector` token injection failed. `inject()` function must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.

This is needed to be able to run `pnpm self-update` on Windows [#&#8203;5700](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/5700).\n- When using pnpm catalogs and running a normal `pnpm install`, pnpm produced false positive warnings for \"*skip adding to the default catalog because it already exists*\". This warning now only prints when using `pnpm add --save-catalog` as originally intended.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

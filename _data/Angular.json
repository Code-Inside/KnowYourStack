`RouterLinkWithHref` classes into one. The motivation for this change is to improve the DX when those directives are used as standalone ones. Currently, developers need to either import `RouterLink` or `RouterLinkWithHref`, depending on whether a host element for the directive is an `<a>` tag or not. This is pretty inconvenient and when a wrong directive is imported, there are no errors or logs, which makes it harder to find the problem. Now the `RouterLink` can be imported and it would work for all host elements.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nThe `RouterLinkWithHref` directive was combined with `RouterLink`, which should be user instead.

[`v0.15.9`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0159)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.8...v0.15.9)\n\n-   Fix an obscure npm package installation issue with `--omit=optional` ([#&#8203;2558](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2558))\n\n    The previous release introduced a regression with `npm install esbuild --omit=optional` where the file `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` would no longer be present after installation. That could cause any package scripts which used the `esbuild` command to no longer work. This release fixes the regression so `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` should now be present again after installation. This regression only affected people installing esbuild using `npm` with either the `--omit=optional` or `--no-optional` flag, which is a somewhat unusual situation.\n\n    **More details:**\n\n    The reason for this regression is due to some obscure npm implementation details. Since the Go compiler doesn't support trivial cross-compiling on certain Android platforms, esbuild's installer installs a WebAssembly shim on those platforms instead. In the previous release I attempted to simplify esbuild's WebAssembly shims to depend on the `esbuild-wasm` package instead of including another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary (to make publishing faster and to save on file system space after installation). However, both the `esbuild` package and the `esbuild-wasm` package provide a binary called `esbuild` and it turns out that adding `esbuild-wasm` as a nested dependency of the `esbuild` package (specifically `esbuild` optionally depends on `@esbuild/android-arm` which depends on `esbuild-wasm`) caused npm to be confused about what `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` is supposed to be.\n\n    It's pretty strange and unexpected that disabling the installation of optional dependencies altogether would suddenly cause an optional dependency's dependency to conflict with the top-level package. What happens under the hood is that if `--omit=optional` is present, npm attempts to uninstall the `esbuild-wasm` nested dependency at the end of `npm install` (even though the `esbuild-wasm` package was never installed due to `--omit=optional`). This uninstallation causes `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` to be deleted.\n\n    After doing a full investigation, I discovered that npm's handling of the `.bin` directory is deliberately very brittle. When multiple packages in the dependency tree put something in `.bin` with the same name, the end result is non-deterministic/random. What you get in `.bin` might be from one package, from the other package, or might be missing entirely. The workaround suggested by npm is to just avoid having two packages that put something in `.bin` with the same name. So this was fixed by making the `@esbuild/android-arm` and `esbuild-android-64` packages each include another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary, which works because these packages don't put anything in `.bin`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.4`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0264-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0263v0264-2022-09-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.3...v0.26.4)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   fix `.replace()` when searching string, add `.replaceAll()` ([#&#8203;222](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/222)) ([04a05bd](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/04a05bdc9bf56e00e616a0ae07923fbd9b63fbd0))\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   avoiding use of Object.defineProperty in Chunk constructor ([#&#8203;219](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/219)) ([130794b](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/130794bb8bfd9f21eb1f50c36a1da8eb5443d256))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.5`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1805-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1804v1805-2022-09-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v18.0.4...v18.0.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add missing npm config environment variable ([#&#8203;8996](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8996)) ([7c1be20](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/7c1be20aef46aaf5029732a580ec65aa8008aa9c))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.55.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1550)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.54.9...1.55.0)\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** Sass numbers are now universally stored as\n    64-bit floating-point numbers, rather than sometimes being stored as integers.\n    This will generally make arithmetic with very large numbers more reliable and\n    more consistent across platforms, but it does mean that numbers between nine\n    quadrillion and nine quintillion will no longer be represented with full\n    accuracy when compiling Sass on the Dart VM.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** Sass equality is now properly [transitive].\n    Two numbers are now considered equal (after doing unit conversions) if they\n    round to the same `1e-11`th. Previously, numbers were considered equal if they\n    were within `1e-11` of one another, which led to some circumstances where `$a == $b` and `$b == $c` but `$a != $b`.\n\n[transitive]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_property\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** Various functions in `sass:math` no longer\n    treat floating-point numbers that are very close (but not identical) to\n    integers as integers. Instead, these functions now follow the floating-point\n    specification exactly. For example, `math.pow(0.000000000001, -1)` now returns\n    `1000000000000` instead of `Infinity`.\n\n-   Emit a deprecation warning for `$a -$b` and `$a +$b`, since these look like\n    they could be unary operations but they're actually parsed as binary\n    operations. Either explicitly write `$a - $b` or `$a (-$b)`. See\n    https://sass-lang.com/d/strict-unary for more details.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add an optional `argumentName` parameter to `SassScriptException()` to make it\n    easier to throw exceptions associated with particular argument names.\n\n-   Most APIs that previously returned `num` now return `double`. All APIs\n    continue to *accept* `num`, although in Dart 2.0.0 these APIs will be changed\n    to accept only `double`.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix a bug in which certain warning spans would not have their properties\n    accessible by the JS API.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v0.15.8`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0158)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.7...v0.15.8)\n\n-   Fix JSX name collision edge case ([#&#8203;2534](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2534))\n\n    Code generated by esbuild could have a name collision in the following edge case:\n\n    -   The JSX transformation mode is set to `automatic`, which causes `import` statements to be inserted\n    -   An element uses a `{...spread}` followed by a `key={...}`, which uses the legacy `createElement` fallback imported from `react`\n    -   Another import uses a name that ends with `react` such as `@remix-run/react`\n    -   The output format has been set to CommonJS so that `import` statements are converted into require calls\n\n    In this case, esbuild previously generated two variables with the same name `import_react`, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    var import_react = require(\"react\");\n    var import_react2 = require(\"@&#8203;remix-run/react\");\n    ```\n\n    That bug is fixed in this release. The code generated by esbuild no longer contains a name collision.\n\n-   Fall back to WebAssembly on Android ARM ([#&#8203;1556](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1556), [#&#8203;1578](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1578), [#&#8203;2335](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2335), [#&#8203;2526](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2526))\n\n    Go's compiler supports trivial cross-compiling to almost all platforms without installing any additional software other than the Go compiler itself. This has made it very easy for esbuild to publish native binary executables for many platforms. However, it strangely doesn't support cross-compiling to Android ARM without installing the Android build tools.\n\n    So instead of publishing a native esbuild binary executable to npm, this release publishes a WebAssembly fallback build. This is essentially the same as the `esbuild-wasm` package but it's installed automatically when you install the `esbuild` package on Android ARM. So packages that depend on the `esbuild` package should now work on Android ARM. This change has not yet been tested end-to-end because I don't have a 32-bit Android ARM device myself, but in theory it should work.\n\n    This inherits the drawbacks of WebAssembly including significantly slower performance than native as well as potentially also more severe memory usage limitations and lack of certain features (e.g. `--serve`). If you want to use a native binary executable of esbuild on Android ARM, you may be able to build it yourself from source after installing the Android build tools.\n\n-   Attempt to better support Yarn's `ignorePatternData` feature ([#&#8203;2495](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2495))\n\n    Part of resolving paths in a project using Yarn's Plug'n'Play feature involves evaluating a regular expression in the `ignorePatternData` property of `.pnp.data.json`. However, it turns out that the particular regular expressions generated by Yarn use some syntax that works with JavaScript regular expressions but that does not work with Go regular expressions.\n\n    In this release, esbuild will now strip some of the the problematic syntax from the regular expression before compiling it, which should hopefully allow it to be compiled by Go's regular expression engine. The specific character sequences that esbuild currently strips are as follows:\n\n    -   `(?!\\.)`\n    -   `(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.)`\n    -   `(?!\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))`\n    -   `(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))`\n\n    These seem to be used by Yarn to avoid the `.` and `..` path segments in the middle of relative paths. The removal of these character sequences seems relatively harmless in this case since esbuild shouldn't ever generate such path segments. This change should add support to esbuild for Yarn's [`pnpIgnorePatterns`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#pnpIgnorePatterns) feature.\n\n-   Fix non-determinism issue with legacy block-level function declarations and strict mode ([#&#8203;2537](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2537))\n\n    When function declaration statements are nested inside a block in strict mode, they are supposed to only be available within that block's scope. But in \"sloppy mode\" (which is what non-strict mode is commonly called), they are supposed to be available within the whole function's scope:\n\n    ```js\n    // This returns 1 due to strict mode\n    function test1() {\n      'use strict'\n      function fn() { return 1 }\n      if (true) { function fn() { return 2 } }\n      return fn()\n    }\n\n    // This returns 2 due to sloppy mode\n    function test2() {\n      function fn() { return 1 }\n      if (true) { function fn() { return 2 } }\n      return fn()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    To implement this, esbuild compiles these two functions differently to reflect their different semantics:\n\n    ```js\n    function test1() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      function fn() {\n        return 1;\n      }\n      if (true) {\n        let fn2 = function() {\n          return 2;\n        };\n      }\n      return fn();\n    }\n    function test2() {\n      function fn() {\n        return 1;\n      }\n      if (true) {\n        let fn2 = function() {\n          return 2;\n        };\n        var fn = fn2;\n      }\n      return fn();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, the compilation had a subtle bug where the automatically-generated function-level symbols for multible hoisted block-level function declarations in the same block a sloppy-mode context were generated in a random order if the output was in strict mode, which could be the case if TypeScript's `alwaysStrict` setting was set to true. This lead to non-determinism in the output as the minifier would randomly exchange the generated names for these symbols on different runs. This bug has been fixed by sorting the keys of the unordered map before iterating over them.\n\n-   Fix parsing of `@keyframes` with string identifiers ([#&#8203;2555](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555))\n\n    Firefox supports `@keyframes` with string identifier names. Previously this was treated as a syntax error by esbuild as it doesn't work in any other browser. The specification allows for this however, so it's technically not a syntax error (even though it would be unwise to use this feature at the moment). There was also a bug where esbuild would remove the identifier name in this case as the syntax wasn't recognized.\n\n    This release changes esbuild's parsing of `@keyframes` to now consider this case to be an unrecognized CSS rule. That means it will be passed through unmodified (so you can now use esbuild to bundle this Firefox-specific CSS) but the CSS will not be pretty-printed or minified. I don't think it makes sense for esbuild to have special code to handle this Firefox-specific syntax at this time. This decision can be revisited in the future if other browsers add support for this feature.\n\n-   Add the `--jsx-side-effects` API option ([#&#8203;2539](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2539), [#&#8203;2546](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2546))\n\n    By default esbuild assumes that JSX expressions are side-effect free, which means they are annoated with `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` comments and are removed during bundling when they are unused. This follows the common use of JSX for virtual DOM and applies to the vast majority of JSX libraries. However, some people have written JSX libraries that don't have this property. JSX expressions can have arbitrary side effects and can't be removed. If you are using such a library, you can now pass `--jsx-side-effects` to tell esbuild that JSX expressions have side effects so it won't remove them when they are unused.\n\n    This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;rtsao](https://togithub.com/rtsao).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.11.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4111-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4110v4111-2022-09-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.11.0...v4.11.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is done by passing the transpiled TypeScript to Babel preset-env.\r\n\r\n**Note about useDefineForClassFields**: while setting this to `false` will output JavaScript which is not spec compliant, this is needed because TypeScript introduced class fields many years before it was ratified in TC39. The latest version of the spec have a different runtime behavior to TypeScript’s implementation but the same syntax. Therefore, we opt-out from using upcoming ECMA runtime behavior to better support the ECO system and libraries that depend on the non spec compliant output. One of biggest case is usages of the deprecated `@Effect` decorator by NGRX and potentially other existing code as well which otherwise would cause runtime failures. Dropping `useDefineForClassFields` will be considered in a future major releases. For more information see: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45995.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Internally the Angular CLI now always set the TypeScript `target` to `ES2022` and `useDefineForClassFields` to `false` unless the target is set to `ES2022` or later in the TypeScript configuration.

For example when using schematics CLI or testing schematics, \r\nreadJsonWorkspace will be called without any chance for customization.\r\n\r\nIn our case, running a schematic test suite results in the console becoming illegible by being floated by tens of thousands warnings, with no way to suppress them.\r\n\r\nIn other words: Each execution of SchematicTestRunner.runSchematicAsync will fetch workspace with standard configuration resulting in 100s of warnings.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution A\r\n\r\nAllow workspace to have an additional node named `extraProjectExtensions`.\r\nAlways merge its contents (Array<string>) into allowedProjectExtensions.\r\n\r\nBenefits of this solution:\r\na) will always work\r\nb) does not suppress *useful* warnings\r\nc) it is easier to see what is going on because the setup is not hidden in any cli libraries but easily accessible in config.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution B\r\n\r\nAdd a option to disable these warnings entirely.\r\nFor example a flag within workspace json, allowing to disable these checks.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\na) simpler than Solution A\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nb) MAY obfuscate errors by suppressing warnings\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nNot a typical bug, but if anyone needs to see it for him/herself:\r\n\r\nadd a custom node to angular.json project, for example like nx does:\r\n```json\r\n\"tags\": [\"env:frontend\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nset up a unit test executing SchematicTestRunner \r\n\r\nrun it and see how each test generates warnings about the workspace containing invalid names.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\"Project extension with invalid name (xxx) found.\"\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 14.2.1\r\nNode: 16.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack   0.1402.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                14.2.2\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.4\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\nwebpack                         5.74.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis change is reason for https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/11138\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23937","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"issue with parseWorkspace \"lint\" warnings -  should be suppressable or have static configuration\" (#23937)"},{"Id":"1378441854","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-20T14:19:45","Actor":"clydin","Number":"23933","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): remove use of global require resolve","State":"closed","Body":"The global require function is not present in Node.js ESM mode.

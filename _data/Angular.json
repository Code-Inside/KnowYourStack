For example, a sum of values should be less than 100, I want the validator to be triggered when any control in the form array changes, it's a validator that is applicable to multiple controls, thus it should be part of the array validators.\n\nI also hope a path selector like this (with paths like `arrayControl.*.controlName`, as in take all `controlName` controls within arrayControl) would be available in new signal forms, with the added performance benefit that only matched controls (and not all array controls) will trigger the validators to re-run.\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI volunteer myself to make an attempt at implementing it for Reactive forms, similar to `.get` in case this is approved.

are recommending that maintainers for packages such as esbuild switch to [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test.

Files were filtered only after analysis via shouldMigrate callbacks, which meant unnecessary template resolution and analysis occurred for files outside the specified path.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the path filtering used startsWith() without checking directory boundaries, causing paths like \"src/app/test-path-not\" to match when filtering for \"src/app/test-path\".\r\n\r\nThis change adds proper path filtering in the afterProgramCreation hook before analysis begins, and ensures directory boundaries are respected by appending '/' to the path comparison.

With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n### [`v0.25.12`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02512)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.11...v0.25.12)\n\n- Fix a minification regression with CSS media queries ([#&#8203;4315](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4315))\n\n  The previous release introduced support for parsing media queries which unintentionally introduced a regression with the removal of duplicate media rules during minification. Specifically the grammar for `@media <media-type> and <media-condition-without-or> { ... }` was missing an equality check for the `<media-condition-without-or>` part, so rules with different suffix clauses in this position would incorrectly compare equal and be deduplicated. This release fixes the regression.\n\n- Update the list of known JavaScript globals ([#&#8203;4310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4310))\n\n  This release updates esbuild's internal list of known JavaScript globals. These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global `Array` property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global `scrollY` property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free. This update adds the following global properties:\n\n  From [ES2017](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2017/):\n\n  - `Atomics`\n  - `SharedArrayBuffer`\n\n  From [ES2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/):\n\n  - `BigInt64Array`\n  - `BigUint64Array`\n\n  From [ES2021](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/):\n\n  - `FinalizationRegistry`\n  - `WeakRef`\n\n  From [ES2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/):\n\n  - `Float16Array`\n  - `Iterator`\n\n  Note that this does not indicate that constructing any of these objects is side-effect free, just that accessing the identifier is side-effect free. For example, this now allows esbuild to tree-shake classes that extend from `Iterator`:\n\n  ```js\n  // This can now be tree-shaken by esbuild:\n  class ExampleIterator extends Iterator {}\n  ```\n\n- Add support for the new `@view-transition` CSS rule ([#&#8203;4313](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4313))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now has improved support for pretty-printing and minifying the new `@view-transition` rule (which esbuild was previously unaware of):\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n\n  /* Old output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition { navigation: auto; types: check; }\n\n  /* New output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The new view transition feature provides a mechanism for creating animated transitions between documents in a multi-page app. You can read more about view transition rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;view-transition).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://redirect.github.com/yisibl).\n\n- Trim CSS rules that will never match\n\n  The CSS minifier will now remove rules whose selectors contain `:is()` and `:where()` as those selectors will never match. These selectors can currently be automatically generated by esbuild when you give esbuild nonsensical input such as the following:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  div:before {\n    color: green;\n    &.foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}:is().foo{color:red}\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}\n  ```\n\n  This input is nonsensical because CSS nesting is (unfortunately) not supported inside of pseudo-elements such as `:before`. Currently esbuild generates a rule containing `:is()` in this case when you tell esbuild to transform nested CSS into non-nested CSS. I think it's reasonable to do that as it sort of helps explain what's going on (or at least indicates that something is wrong in the output). It shouldn't be present in minified code, however, so this release now strips it out.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n### [`v0.25.12`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02512)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.11...v0.25.12)\n\n- Fix a minification regression with CSS media queries ([#&#8203;4315](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4315))\n\n  The previous release introduced support for parsing media queries which unintentionally introduced a regression with the removal of duplicate media rules during minification. Specifically the grammar for `@media <media-type> and <media-condition-without-or> { ... }` was missing an equality check for the `<media-condition-without-or>` part, so rules with different suffix clauses in this position would incorrectly compare equal and be deduplicated. This release fixes the regression.\n\n- Update the list of known JavaScript globals ([#&#8203;4310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4310))\n\n  This release updates esbuild's internal list of known JavaScript globals. These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global `Array` property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global `scrollY` property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free. This update adds the following global properties:\n\n  From [ES2017](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2017/):\n\n  - `Atomics`\n  - `SharedArrayBuffer`\n\n  From [ES2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/):\n\n  - `BigInt64Array`\n  - `BigUint64Array`\n\n  From [ES2021](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/):\n\n  - `FinalizationRegistry`\n  - `WeakRef`\n\n  From [ES2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/):\n\n  - `Float16Array`\n  - `Iterator`\n\n  Note that this does not indicate that constructing any of these objects is side-effect free, just that accessing the identifier is side-effect free. For example, this now allows esbuild to tree-shake classes that extend from `Iterator`:\n\n  ```js\n  // This can now be tree-shaken by esbuild:\n  class ExampleIterator extends Iterator {}\n  ```\n\n- Add support for the new `@view-transition` CSS rule ([#&#8203;4313](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4313))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now has improved support for pretty-printing and minifying the new `@view-transition` rule (which esbuild was previously unaware of):\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n\n  /* Old output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition { navigation: auto; types: check; }\n\n  /* New output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The new view transition feature provides a mechanism for creating animated transitions between documents in a multi-page app. You can read more about view transition rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;view-transition).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://redirect.github.com/yisibl).\n\n- Trim CSS rules that will never match\n\n  The CSS minifier will now remove rules whose selectors contain `:is()` and `:where()` as those selectors will never match. These selectors can currently be automatically generated by esbuild when you give esbuild nonsensical input such as the following:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  div:before {\n    color: green;\n    &.foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}:is().foo{color:red}\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}\n  ```\n\n  This input is nonsensical because CSS nesting is (unfortunately) not supported inside of pseudo-elements such as `:before`. Currently esbuild generates a rule containing `:is()` in this case when you tell esbuild to transform nested CSS into non-nested CSS. I think it's reasonable to do that as it sort of helps explain what's going on (or at least indicates that something is wrong in the output). It shouldn't be present in minified code, however, so this release now strips it out.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

are recommending that maintainers for packages such as esbuild switch to [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.4.4`](https://redirect.github.com/kriszyp/lmdb-js/compare/v3.4.3...v3.4.4)\n\n[Compare

Any `test.setupFiles` from `vitest-base.config.ts` are now added to the CLI's setup files, supporting both single string and array formats. User-defined Vite plugins from `vitest-base.config.ts` are also combined with the builder's plugins, with a filter to prevent duplicating internal CLI plugins.\r\n\r\nThese updates give users more flexibility to customize their Vitest setup while keeping the Angular CLI's test builder predictable.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31729","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): enhance Vitest config merging and validation\" (#31729)"},{"Id":"3604270222","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-09T01:08:20","Actor":"Deku-nattsu","Number":"31728","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): provide file dependencies map on compilation initialize result","State":"open","Body":"I am writing a rsbuild plugin that compiles angular, it uses the compilation classes underneath and thanks to the exposure of [createAngularCompilation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/53bdbf1dc056ad8a3c29000b66dc780217b4d28c/packages/angular/build/src/private.ts#L62) its been fairly smooth to implement. \r\n\r\nhowever I’ve encountered a blocker when wiring up a dev server that correctly associates component TypeScript files with their html template resources. for this a dependency map is needed and that's what [getResourceDependencies](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular/build/src/tools/angular/compilation/aot-compilation.ts#L183) provides. but it isn’t publicly accessible from the compilation which is fair.\r\n\r\nso right now, the only option seems to be creating a second Angular compiler instance in my plugin solely to access that API, which isn’t ideal.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n- Use `Uint8Array.fromBase64` if available ([#&#8203;4286](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4286))\n\n  With this release, esbuild's `binary` loader will now use the new [`Uint8Array.fromBase64`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/fromBase64) function unless it's unavailable in the configured target environment. If it's unavailable, esbuild's previous code for this will be used as a fallback. Note that this means you may now need to specify `target` when using this feature with Node (for example `--target=node22`) unless you're using Node v25+.\n\n- Update the Go compiler from v1.23.12 to v1.25.4 ([#&#8203;4208](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4208), [#&#8203;4311](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4311))\n\n  This raises the operating system requirements for running esbuild:\n\n  - Linux: now requires a kernel version of 3.2 or later\n  - macOS: now requires macOS 12 (Monterey) or later\n\n### [`v0.26.0`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0260)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.12...v0.26.0)\n\n- Enable trusted publishing ([#&#8203;4281](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4281))\n\n  GitHub and npm are recommending that maintainers for packages such as esbuild switch to [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). With this release, a VM on GitHub will now build and publish all of esbuild's packages to npm instead of me. In theory.\n\n  Unfortunately there isn't really a way to test that this works other than to do it live. So this release is that live test. Hopefully this release is uneventful and is exactly the same as the previous one (well, except for the green provenance attestation checkmark on npm that happens with trusted publishing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.24.1`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.24.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.24.0...v14.24.1)\n\n- Fixed issue where MCP server was blocked by console.log\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The soft keyboard closes and no option is selected. When I click again on the formfield, the dropdown appears again and now I can select and option. That seems to be a consistent behaviour on Android 13/Chrome.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.x\n- CDK/Material: 202.2.12\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android 13\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MAT-AUTOCOMPLETE): on option select on chrome android 13, dropdown collapses without selection\" (#32275)"},{"Id":"3597586073","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T20:52:57","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"32272","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"21.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v21.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#32272)"},{"Id":"3597566668","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T20:48:33","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"32271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32271","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#32271)"},{"Id":"3597386332","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T20:29:35","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"32270","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Cherry pick] build: add explicit dependency to yaml (#32201)","State":"closed","Body":"The docs site deployment seems to indirectly depend on `yaml`.

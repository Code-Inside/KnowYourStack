Also, if `@SkipSelf()` (or other flags) aren't supported, an error should be raised (compile time or runtime) instead of injecting the wrong argument.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nThis is a

But they're totally wrong. Component styles won't \"escape\" the prison of the component and there's no way to target host element (other than ng-deep).  See stackblitz below.\r\n\r\nLet's go through the doc problems:\r\n\r\n> Use the :host pseudo-class selector to target styles in the element that hosts the component (as opposed to targeting elements inside the component's template).\r\n\r\n* `:host(.parabove) { color: magenta;}`  never gets applied to `div.parabove`. \r\n* `:host {  color: pink; } ` gets applied to `<child` tag itself, which means `:host === child tag space`. \r\n\r\n-> This should be rewritten as \"You will never be able to jump out of component's css prison. `:host` targets the element itself, it will never go \"beyond\" the component.\r\n\r\n> :host-context  Sometimes it's useful to apply styles based on some condition outside of a component's view\r\n\r\nNever ever you will escape the component prison. This should be clearly stated with no double meaning.  _outside of component's view_ is a double-meaning wording, it implies that that's possible by some tiny luck, even if it refers to the CONDITION and not to the CSS style application itself. Wording should be corrected. Double-emphasize the \"condition\".\r\n\r\n> yle to all &lt;h2&gt; elements _inside_ the compon\r\n\r\nI like how you highlighted the \"inside\" word. You had probably gotten hell lot of tickets and questions related to that. This should really be emphasized even more. Don't use words that might saw doubt or express possibility, instead state clearly and strongly that it's impossible to get out of element's scope from within the component CSS.\r\n\r\nIt's also funny how the wording is correct around these :host selector sections --\r\nAbove the :host you find paragraph that has a red plank with \"_The styles specified in @Component metadata apply only within the template of that component._\", the paragraph that comes after the :host section mentions ::ng-deep with \"_styles normally apply only to the HTML in the component's own template_\". Thus, everything is right in those paragraphs, it's just this :host and :host-context para is confusing.\r\nRemember, there are lots of ESL users whose brains might not \"click in\" on right words or in right moments. Find a native English speaker and ask him to proof-read and eliminate the confusion.

Just like the following cases \r\n\r\n1. `@Input()` and the input is declared in the parent template. \r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-push',\r\n  template: `\r\n    {{name}}\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nclass PushComponent {\r\n  @Input() name;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n    <my-push [name]=\"value\"></my-push>\r\n  `\r\n}) \r\nclass ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `value` updated, `my-push` will be checked.\r\n\r\nBut if the `@Input() name` is not declared in the parent template.\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n    <my-push [name]=\"value\"></my-push>\r\n  `\r\n}) \r\nclass ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n\r\n`my-push` will not be checked when `value` changed, even it is `@Input()` \r\n \r\n2. `@Output()`, the same with `@Input()`, the output listener must be declared in the parent component.\r\n3. `event listeners`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-push',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div (click)=\"click()\"></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nclass PushComponent {\r\n  click() {\r\n    // will mark self dirty\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in `AppComponent`, except `event listener` or manually call `markForCheck()/detectChanges()`, there is no other way to trigger change detection automatically. \r\n\r\nSo  maybe we should always check `bootstrapped` component event it is `OnPush` or give a warning in this case?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39462","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"AppComponent OnPush not triggers change detection\" (#39462)"},{"Id":"730813799","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-28T04:10:38","Actor":"JohnsonMG","Number":"39460","RawContent":null,"Title":"Radio buttons not applying attr.name when using [name] binding","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen binding to radio inputs, using `[name]=\"myNameVariable\"` does not apply the attr.name value, meaning the tab order does not work.

This restores that functionality in\r\nIvy. There are some questions related to which scenarios we want to\r\nconsider. Namely ViewEngine would navigate all the way up to the module\r\nto retrieve a token, but it's unclear whether we'd want to continue\r\ndoing that in Ivy as modules have no concept of elements.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Note the second commit that changes 2 files to make this happen:\r\nhttps://github.com/SLKnutson/angular-bug\r\nRun `ng build --configuration=\"production\"` and then look at the dist/styles.css file.\r\nCharset needs to be the first line in the file, but it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nFound in mac and linux, haven't tried Windows\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIf node-sass is used, this problem doesn't occur because node-sass doesn't change the '\\f103' into a unicode character, and so no `@charset \"UTF-8\";` is needed.\r\n\r\nWhen optimization=true in angular.json, the error is fixed.\r\n\r\nI've done a little bit of digging, the css looks good coming out of the actual sass compiler, but gets messed up somewhere after that.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19246","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@charset \"UTF-8\"; not lifted to the top of the css file when @import url()

Maybe in the next lines also, but I did not check it yet.\r\n\r\nI tried to add an element, that perfectly fits, but I could not. I realized that the double of the original margin is used on the right side. I used LTR.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n\r\nTake a document, that has 400px width. The margin is 20px on the viewport of the overlay. I tried to add one overlay at (300, 20) with size of (80,40). I will use this in the stackblitz and in the calculations.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ardamx\r\n\r\n![overlay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6360699/97225389-df307d00-17d2-11eb-8399-e5a339d20aca.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you see the overlay is positioned well at the begining. 100px is the container. 80px is the overlay. 10-80-10 is well positioned.\r\n\r\nIf the body element is 420px width, the position is right. 0-80-20.\r\n\r\nIf the body is shrinked more to 400px, the position will not be 0-80-20, however it could fit.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\npushX to be 0 in this case. The element should fit without pushing it. The margin should be 20px on the right, too.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nstart.x is 300, the width is 80 as these are given. The viewport width is 360px (=400px-2*20px).\r\n\r\npushX will be -20 as overflowRight is 20. This is calculated by 300+80-360=20.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong. The element can fit without pushing it. The margin is now the double of the originally given, which is 40px in this case.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.1.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome (Could be any)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS (Could be any)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20890","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(overlay): Push calculation is wrong with FlexibleConnectedPositionStrategy\" (#20890)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-10-29T05:30:07.3232373Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3567}

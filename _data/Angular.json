{"Data":{"Angular-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2255245163","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-21T20:15:20","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"55456","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler-cli): enable narrowing of signal reads in templates","State":"open","Body":"Signal reads in Angular templates don't currently benefit from TypeScript's narrowing capabilities, since function calls are not eligle for type narrowing. This is unfortunate since Angular templates should not be updating signal values, such that narrowing would be a safe operation.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a way for TypeScript to enable type-narrowing of signal reads, but this is unfortunately not possible today.\r\n\r\nVarious potential designs have been explored to support type-narrowing of signal reads in the compiler's Type-Check Block (TCB):\r\n\r\n1. Assign call expressions to a local variable in the TCB, rewriting further usages of the same signal to the local variable instead. This way, TypeScript is able to apply narrowing of this local variable that all subsequent reads are then able to leverage.\r\n\r\n2. Augment the `Function` declaration with a getter field corresponding with the function's return type, then emitting call expression as property reads using this augmented getter.\r\n\r\nAlthough approach 2 simplifies the TCB emit compared to 1, it could not be made to work in practice as the `Function` declaration itself doesn't have any generic type to extract the return type from.\r\n\r\nInstead, this commit implements approach 1. The primary known design limitation of this approach arrises with optional chaining, where the call expressions end up with different identities to prevent reusing an earlier variable declaration for the call expression. For example, consider the following template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (person()?.address()) {\r\n\t<app-address [address]=\"person().address()\">\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNormally in TypeScript this would be accepted (provided that the call expressions are just property reads), but our referencing approach does not consider the signal reads of `address()` to have the same receiver. You may think this limitation can be overcome by always identifying property reads as equivalent to their safe counterpart (i.e. always treating `.` as `?.`) but doing so would introduce false negatives in the negated case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (!person()?.address()) {\r\n\t<app-address [address]=\"person().address()\">\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `person().address()` was to correspond with `person()?.address()` to make it align with the condition, then no error would be reported that `person()` may be `null`. To avoid such false negatives in template diagnostics this commit is being conservative with optional chains, where narrowing is not achieved as would be the case with property reads. Perhaps there may be ways of improving this in the future.\r\n\r\nAnother side effect of this change is that diagnostics won't be reported within expressions that have been substituted with a reference. Consider:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (person().nam()) {\r\n\t{{ person().nam() }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the secondary occurrence of `person().nam()` is being substituted for the local variable that is assigned within the `@if`-condition, the typo in `nam()` is not reported for the expression in the block.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is still a draft, the code needs more tests and we have to determine how to roll this out (i.e. opt-in vs opt-out vs always on).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55456","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler-cli): enable narrowing of signal reads

hypothesis proves that when creating a page with SSR, the API is not called on the server side.\r\nThere is also the following error in the console (exception section)\r\n\r\nConsidering that I put a version with http on the server, but there is still a problem\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/alisafariir/angular-esbuild-http-ssr-issue\n\n###

Now, `_variables.scss` will automatically import `_variables-dark.scss`. If you were already importing `_variables-dark.scss` manually, you should keep doing it as it won't break anything and will be the way to go in v6.\n-   Fixed a regression in the selector engine that wasn't able to handle multiple IDs anymore.\n\n#### Color modes\n\n-   Badges now use the `.text-bg-*` text utilities to be certain that the text is always readable (especially when the customized colors are different in light and dark modes).\n-   Fixed our `color-modes.js` script to handle the case where the OS is set to light mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from our docs, you should apply [this change](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/73e1dcf43eff8371dde52ce41bd1d9fdc2b47d1f) to your own script.\n-   Fixed color schemes description in the color modes documentation to show that `color-scheme()` only accept `light` and `dark` values as parameters.\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\n-   Allowed `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>` in the sanitizer.\n-   Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers.\n-   Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions.\n-   Fixed the focus box-shadow for the validation stated form controls.\n-   Fixed the focus ring on focused checked buttons.\n-   Fixed the product example mobile navbar toggler.\n-   Changed the RTL processing of carousel control icons.\n\n***\n\n#### 🎨 CSS\n\n-   [#&#8203;37508](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/37508): Use child combinators to avoid inheriting parent accordion's flush styles\n-

[devDependencies](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adependencies+project%3Atwbs%2F32+is%3Aclosed)\n\n### [`v5.3.2`](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v5.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/compare/v5.3.1...v5.3.2)\n\n#### Highlights\n\n-   Passing a percentage unit to the global `abs()` is deprecated since Dart Sass v1.65.0. It resulted in a deprecation warning when compiling Bootstrap with Dart Sass. This has been fixed internally by changing the values passed to the `divide()` function. The `divide()` function has not been fixed itself so that we can keep supporting node-sass cross-compatibility. In v6, this won't be an issue as we plan to drop support for node-sass.\n-   Using multiple `id`s in a collapse target wasn't working anymore and has been fixed.\n\n#### Color modes\n\n-   Increased color contrast of form range track background in light and dark modes.\n-   Fixed table state rendering for color modes with a focus on the striped table in dark mode to increase color contrast.\n-   Allow `<mark>` color customization for color modes.\n\n#### Docs\n\n-   Added alternative CDNs section in [Getting started -> Download](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/#alternative-cdns).\n-   Added Discord and Bootstrap subreddit links in [README](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/README.md) and [Getting started -> Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/):\n    -

However, I've noticed a significant impact on performance metrics, particularly First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), when using the new version.\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, I found that Angular now splits all JavaScript code into chunks and adds a ```<link rel=\"modulepreload\">``` for each chunk in the ```<head>``` of the page. Although the scripts are loaded asynchronously with [@defer](https://angular.io/api/core/defer) method, the preloaded scripts seem to be affecting the rendering of critical content, delaying FCP and LCP.\r\n\r\nI've conducted tests using Lighthouse, and the results show that removing the modulepreload links improves FCP and LCP metrics. This issue seems to be similar to what was reported in these GitHub discussions:\r\n\r\n[GoogleChrome/lighthouse#11960](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/11960#issuecomment-779049941)\r\n[vitejs/vite#5991](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/5991#issuecomment-1088711936)\r\nIn both discussions, users reported improvements in FCP and LCP metrics after disabling or reducing the number of modulepreload links.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a way to selectively disable modulepreload links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 based on specific use cases. Therefore, I would like to seek clarification and guidance on how to address this issue to improve performance.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\nUpgrade an Angular application to version 18.0.0-next.4.\r\nEnable SSR and use esbuild.\r\nAnalyze performance metrics using Lighthouse with and without the modulepreload links.\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nI expect to see improved FCP and LCP metrics when excessive modulepreload links are removed or selectively disabled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nI have attached screenshots of the Lighthouse test results, showing the impact of modulepreload links on performance metrics.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1 - Lighthouse Test with modulepreload links\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132612](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/95b5a3ac-ac96-43a5-90f3-f538f900ec19)\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2 - Lighthouse Test without modulepreload links\r\nPerformed by removing all modulepreload links server side: \r\n```typescript\r\n        html = html.replace(\r\n          /<link .?rel=\"modulepreload\" .*?href=\"(?<href>.+?\\.js)\".*?>/g,\r\n          ''\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 132254](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/8948699/0719109b-e98c-409b-9028-a72c4add7210)\r\n\r\nYour assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.0-next.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0-next.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... google-maps, language-service, localize, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1800.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        17.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular/ssr                      18.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular               18.0.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                              7.8.1\r\ntypescript                        5.4.5\r\nzone.js                           0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Excessive modulepreload Links in Angular 18.0.0-next.4 Affecting Performance Metrics\" (#27490)"},{"Id":"2246289277","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-16T15:18:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27482","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove `type=\"text/css\"` from `style` tag","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n`type=\"text/css\"` is deprecated, for more info see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style#deprecated_attributes\r\n\r\nCloses: #27471\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27482","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove `type=\"text/css\"` from `style` tag\" (#27482)"},{"Id":"2246279410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-16T15:18:22","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27481","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: replace vite `server.ws.send` usages","State":"closed","Body":"The above mentioned API is deprecated.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27481","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: replace vite `server.ws.send` usages\" (#27481)"},{"Id":"2245786854","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-16T11:18:44","Actor":"undsoft","Number":"27479","RawContent":null,"Title":"[browser-esbuild] live-reload=false workflow is less convenient now","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nI often work with `live-reload` disabled.

For example, if you drag from a first row to a second row starting from the right and moving down to the left, once you get to the second row, the drop placeholder will show up on the right regardless of where the cursor was when you entered the second row. From here on, the directions will be reversed. If you drag to the right the drop placeholder will be seen on the left and vice versa.\r\nAm I doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nEdit: It seems that the problem occurs only when I change the width of the placeholder and when passing from the first droplist to the second droplist. In this case I do not land on the space intended for the drop placeholder but on another list item. The problem seems to be in the \"_getItemIndexFromPointerPosition\" method, where, analyzing the conditions, the case of not landing on the placeholder is not allowed. In fact, everything works fine when landing on the placeholder and then moving to the other list item since the condition \"drag == this._previousSwap.drag\" will result false and will allow the placeholder to be recalculated. While having a custom width of the placeholder and landing directly on the element make the previous condition to will always be true.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-aotvtz\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Compare with the toggle animation used in Material Web: https://material-web.dev/components/switch/stories/\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe slide toggle animation should not be jarring when using an M3 theme.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe slide toggle animation uses the short animation duration from M2 and appears jarring.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.3.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.3.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28916","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/slide-toggle): Animation duration in M3 should be 300ms\" (#28916)"},{"Id":"2253066082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-19T13:44:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28915","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: test webdriver","State":"open","Body":"Tries to deflake the Webdriver test by not waiting for Angular to stabilize.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28915","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: test webdriver\" (#28915)"},{"Id":"2252921714","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-19T13:34:24","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28914","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update selenium webdriver","State":"closed","Body":"Updates Selenium Webdriver in an attempt to deflake the e2e tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28914","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update selenium webdriver\" (#28914)"},{"Id":"2252242579","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-19T07:07:34","Actor":"leomayer","Number":"28912","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inputfeat(Input - Textarea): Let the area grow with flexbox","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThe `textarea` should grow flexible depending on the what space is available.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that there exists the directive `cdkTextareaAutosize` but this will let the `textarea` grow depending on the input.

After a crash, the web inspector reveals nothing unusual, nor is there any console output. I was able to capture chrome debug logs during one such crash, but it did not reveal anything interesting.\r\n\r\nI realise that this report isn't particularly useful since I can't reliably reproduce the error, but I suspect this may be happening more widely than is realised since it's unlikely to get picked up by automated error monitoring.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nWe have not been able to consistently reproduce the issue.

So I want to pass an object full of subjects (searching$, **sorting$**, paging$, etc.) to the TableComponent and make it react to sort events on its own like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\" #tableWrapper (scroll)=\"onScroll()\">\r\n  <mat-table [dataSource]=\"data!\" class=\"table\" matSort (matSortChange)=\"onSort($event)\">\r\n    <mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"columns\"></mat-header-row>\r\n    <mat-row *matRowDef=\"let row; columns: columns\"></mat-row>\r\n    <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n  </mat-table>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I don't add matSort to the host component, I'll get `MatSortHeader must be placed within a parent element with the MatSort directive` error. And if I do, it'll seem to ignore the matSort set in the TableComponent.\r\n\r\nHere's a working example on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-4ja9sf).

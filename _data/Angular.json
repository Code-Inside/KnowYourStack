This can be a problem if the DOM node is retained in memory, because the `LView` has references to all of the child nodes of the view, as well as other internal data structures.\r\n\r\nPreviously we tried to resolve the issue by clearing the `__ngContext__` when a node is removed (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36011), but we decided not to proceeed, because it can slow down destruction due to a megamorphic write.\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to address the issue while reducing the performance impact by assigning a unique ID when an `LView` is created and adding it to `__ngContext__`. All active views are tracked in a map where their unique ID is used as the key. We don't need to worry about leaks within that map,  because `LView`s are an internal data structure and we have complete control over when they are  created and destroyed.\r\n\r\nFixes #41047.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45051","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(core): avoid storing LView in __ngContext__\" (#45051)"},{"Id":"1130030638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-11T06:12:25","Actor":"Zuckjet","Number":"45039","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(zone.js): fix addEventListener behavior when passive option is en…","State":"closed","Body":"…abled\r\n\r\nThis fix the inconsistent behavior when multiple identical eventListeners are registered on the same eventTarget with passive enabled\r\n\r\nClose #45020\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

These include explanations of exactly why the pattern is bad, what users can do about it, and how to suppress it if necessary. Currently however, users get only an error message in their console / IDE. This is hopefully expressive enough for many users, but it is not as comprehensive as AIO, and we should be pointing users to that documentation if they have any questions.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtended diagnostics should include a link to their AIO page.

As in most common angular applications, we have a global stylesheet in which we import the aforementioned dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Angular v13 and its toolchain, we noticed an unexpected increase in the production mode bundle size. Inspecting the build stats, we found out that such increase was concentrated in the main `styles.css` file. With a deeper inspection in the minified file, we found out that many of the global imports were duplicated in the output stylesheet.\r\n\r\nFor us, this is a regression, since before the upgrade this duplication did not occur.\r\n\r\nThe link below brings to a Github repository where we demonstrate the issue with a simple `@angular/material` import. The branches are organized as follows:\r\n\r\n`master` -> Angular 12, works as expected\r\n`feature/angular-13` -> Angular 13, duplicate entries in built style.css\r\n\r\nWe can also provide the unminified versions of the built styles.css bundles (v12 and v13, ready to be compared). Built from the same sources, the v13 indeed does have duplicate rules, while the v12 does not.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ibanjo/angular13-duplicate-styles-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception, just an unexpected increase in the bundle size due to duplicate style rules.

[`v0.14.21`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01421)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.20...v0.14.21)\n\n-   Handle an additional `browser` map edge case ([#&#8203;2001](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2001), [#&#8203;2002](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2002))\n\n    There is a community convention around the `browser` field in `package.json` that allows remapping import paths within a package when the package is bundled for use within a browser. There isn't a rigorous definition of how it's supposed to work and every bundler implements it differently. The approach esbuild uses is to try to be \"maximally compatible\" in that if at least one bundler exhibits a particular behavior regarding the `browser` map that allows a mapping to work, then esbuild also attempts to make that work.\n\n    I have a collection of test cases for this going here: https://github.com/evanw/package-json-browser-tests. However, I was missing test coverage for the edge case where a package path import in a subdirectory of the package could potentially match a remapping. The \"maximally compatible\" approach means replicating bugs in Browserify's implementation of the feature where package paths are mistaken for relative paths and are still remapped. Here's a specific example of an edge case that's now handled:\n\n    -   `entry.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('pkg/sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/package.json`:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"browser\": {\n            \"./sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\",\n            \"./sub/sub\": \"./sub/bar.js\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/sub/foo.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/sub/bar.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        console.log('works')\n        ```\n\n    The import path `sub` in `require('sub')` is mistaken for a relative path by Browserify due to a bug in Browserify, so Browserify treats it as if it were `./sub` instead. This is a Browserify-specific behavior and currently doesn't happen in any other bundler (except for esbuild, which attempts to replicate Browserify's bug).\n\n    Previously esbuild was incorrectly resolving `./sub` relative to the top-level package directory instead of to the subdirectory in this case, which meant `./sub` was incorrectly matching `\"./sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` instead of `\"./sub/sub\": \"./sub/bar.js\"`. This has been fixed so esbuild can now emulate Browserify's bug correctly in this edge case.\n\n-   Support for esbuild with Linux on RISC-V 64bit ([#&#8203;2000](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2000))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now has a published binary executable for the RISC-V 64bit architecture in the [`esbuild-linux-riscv64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-linux-riscv64) npm package. This change was contributed by [@&#8203;piggynl](https://togithub.com/piggynl).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>karma-runner/karma-coverage</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.0`](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;220-httpsgithubcomkarma-runnerkarma-coveragecomparev211v220-2022-02-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   update Istanbul packages ([24aac11](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/commit/24aac11aacef75aab720f69aabaa9651cc770630))\n\n#### [2.1.1](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) (2022-02-05)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   handle unexpected error when generating code coverage ([bca2c69](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/commit/bca2c69d43332598acb30d8e5d6e26d783bc06fb)), closes [/github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/c985155a4eac95c525e1217e98d4013ac5f53305/lib/server.js#L392](https://togithub.com//github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/c985155a4eac95c525e1217e98d4013ac5f53305/lib/server.js/issues/L392)\n-   race condition between the Karma shutdown and coverage writing ([44b31eb](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/commit/44b31eba5a221e6e049b6dff426207f555b379e2)), closes [#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/issues/434)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v13.3.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1330-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1320v1330-2022-02-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.2.0...v13.3.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **puppeteer:** export esm modules in package.json ([#&#8203;7964](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7964)) ([523b487](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/523b487e8802824cecff86d256b4f7dbc4c47c8a))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This causes a CORS error when `<base href=\"\">` inside `index.html` is set to a assets server(for ex: http://127.0.0.1:8443/static/), and `index.html` is loaded over another server(for ex: http://127.0.0.1:8080).\r\n\r\n```\r\nAccess to script at 'http://localhost:8443/static/main.js' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if `type=\"module\"` from the `<script/>` tag is removed, all the other JS chunks (for ex: `663.js`) which are loaded in `main.js` or `runtime.js` are still showing CORS error.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Create a demo angular app using angular cli 13.\r\n2. Add `baseHref` option as empty string(for now) in angular.json.\r\n3. Build the app\r\n    ```\r\n    npm run build -- --configuration development\r\n    ```\r\n4. After building the app, separate out all the JS builds(runtime.js, main.js etc) in one folder and `index.html` in another folder.\r\n5. Download `live-server`\r\n    ```\r\n    npm install -g live-server\r\n    ```\r\n    **Note**: You can use any other way to serve `index.html` and all other JS builds from other server with different domain.\r\n6. Run `live-server` command in the folder containing JS bundles and the note the URL.\r\n7. In the `index.html`, Update `<base href>` tag with URL in step 6, and run the `live-server` command.\r\n8. Assuming the folder containing `index.html` is served through `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html` and you should be able to see the CORS error in the console.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.0.2\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Since updating to Ivy and ng13, the [ng serve] cache system shows a new (seemingly buggy) behavior.\r\nIt happens since migrating to Ivy (which we did latish, with ng13 update), so I marked this as a regression.\r\n\r\nEven with setting cli.cache.enabled = false, the compiler will always use cached node_modules sources.\r\nThe only way I could find to force the compiler to include the changed source is:\r\nStopping ng serve, removing cache folder `rm -rf ./.angular`, restarting `ng serve`\r\nDoing this after every tweak is annoying and a big waste of time while trying to debug code.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSetting `cli.cache.enabled = false` should disable caching for all node_modules sources to allow for debugging like it was possible before Ivy/ng13.\r\n\r\n## Observed behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a file within node_modules is changed and saved, cli/compiler will detect the _saving_ and start recompiling...\r\nBUT it will never use the updated source file, and instead uses a version from angular build cache.\r\n\r\nIt will also happen when\r\n* restarting ng serve\r\n* setting cli.cache.enabled = false in angular.json\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.1.1\r\nNode: 14.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.13\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack   0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                13.1.1\r\n@nguniversal/builders           13.0.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     13.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\nwebpack                         5.64.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22675","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"cli.cache.enabled not working as expected / changes to node_module sources are not reflected\" (#22675)"},{"Id":"1128252324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-09T11:16:54","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"22673","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update scorecard action dependencies to f2027c5","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| github/codeql-action | action | digest | `edd03fb` -> `f2027c5` |\n| ossf/scorecard-action | action | digest | `315c15e` -> `682b53e` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/ampproject/remapping/compare/v2.0.4...v2.1.0)\n\nThe loader API now provides a new `LoadingContext` object, which provides new features:\n\n-   `importer` provides the resolved path of the parent sourcemap.\n-   `source` allows the loader to change the resolved location of the transformed sourcemap or original source file.\n-   `content` allows override the parent sourcemap's `sourcesContent` field for an original source file.\n\nSee https://github.com/ampproject/remapping#advanced-control-of-the-loading-graph for more information.\n\n###

[`v0.14.20`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01420)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.19...v0.14.20)\n\n-   Fix property mangling and keyword properties ([#&#8203;1998](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1998))\n\n    Previously enabling property mangling with `--mangle-props=` failed to add a space before property names after a keyword. This bug has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      static foo = {\n        get bar() {}\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify --mangle-props=.)\n    class Foo{statics={gett(){}}}\n\n    // New output (with --minify --mangle-props=.)\n    class Foo{static s={get t(){}}}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.14.19`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01419)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.18...v0.14.19)\n\n-   Special-case `const` inlining at the top of a scope ([#&#8203;1317](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1317), [#&#8203;1981](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1981))\n\n    The minifier now inlines `const` variables (even across modules during bundling) if a certain set of specific requirements are met:\n\n    -   All `const` variables to be inlined are at the top of their scope\n    -   That scope doesn't contain any `import` or `export` statements with paths\n    -   All constants to be inlined are `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, an integer, or a short real number\n    -   Any expression outside of a small list of allowed ones stops constant identification\n\n    Practically speaking this basically means that you can trigger this optimization by just putting the constants you want inlined into a separate file (e.g. `constants.js`) and bundling everything together.\n\n    These specific conditions are present to avoid esbuild unintentionally causing any behavior changes by inlining constants when the variable reference could potentially be evaluated before being declared. It's possible to identify more cases where constants can be inlined but doing so may require complex call graph analysis so it has not been implemented. Although these specific heuristics may change over time, this general approach to constant inlining should continue to work going forward.\n\n    Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const bold = 1 << 0;\n    const italic = 1 << 1;\n    const underline = 1 << 2;\n    const font = bold | italic | underline;\n    console.log(font);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify --bundle)\n    (()=>{var o=1<<0,n=1<<1,c=1<<2,t=o|n|c;console.log(t);})();\n\n    // New output (with --minify --bundle)\n    (()=>{console.log(7);})();\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>isaacs/minimatch</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.5`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v13.2.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1320-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1313v1320-2022-02-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.3...v13.2.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add more models to DeviceDescriptors ([#&#8203;7904](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7904)) ([6a655cb](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6a655cb647e12eaf1055be0b298908d83bebac25))\n-   **chromium:** roll to Chromium 99.0.4844.16 (r961656) ([#&#8203;7960](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7960)) ([96c3f94](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/96c3f943b2f6e26bd871ecfcce71b6a33e214ebf))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   make projectRoot optional in Puppeteer and launchers ([#&#8203;7967](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7967)) ([9afdc63](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/9afdc6300b80f01091dc4cb42d4ebe952c7d60f0))\n-   migrate more files to strict-mode TypeScript ([#&#8203;7950](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7950)) ([aaac8d9](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/aaac8d9c44327a2c503ffd6c97b7f21e8010c3e4))\n-   typos in documentation ([#&#8203;7968](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7968)) ([41ab4e9](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/41ab4e9127df64baa6c43ecde2f7ddd702ba7b0c))\n\n##### [13.1.3](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.2...v13.1.3) (2022-01-31)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   issue with reading versions.js in doclint ([#&#8203;7940](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7940)) ([06ba963](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/06ba9632a4c63859244068d32c312817d90daf63))\n-   make more files work in strict-mode TypeScript ([#&#8203;7936](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7936)) ([0636513](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/0636513e34046f4d40b5e88beb2b18b16dab80aa))\n-   page.pdf producing an invalid pdf ([#&#8203;7868](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7868)) ([afea509](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/afea509544fb99bfffe5b0bebe6f3575c53802f0)), closes [#&#8203;7757](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7757)\n\n##### [13.1.2](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.1...v13.1.2) (2022-01-25)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **package.json:** update node-fetch package ([#&#8203;7924](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7924)) ([e4c48d3](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/e4c48d3b8c2a812752094ed8163e4f2f32c4b6cb))\n-   types in Browser.ts to be compatible with strict mode Typescript ([#&#8203;7918](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7918)) ([a8ec0aa](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/a8ec0aadc9c90d224d568d9e418d14261e6e85b1)), closes [#&#8203;6769](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6769)\n-   types in Connection.ts to be compatible with strict mode Typescript ([#&#8203;7919](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7919)) ([d80d602](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/d80d6027ea8e1b7fcdaf045398629cf8e6512658)), closes [#&#8203;6769](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6769)\n\n##### [13.1.1](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v13.1.0...v13.1.1) (2022-01-18)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   use content box for OOPIF offset calculations ([#&#8203;7911](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7911)) ([344feb5](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/344feb53c28ce018a4c600d408468f6d9d741eee))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This made it hard to use bundling/loading tools like SystemJS that expect URI's in their module identifier.\r\n\r\nWith TypeScript 2.0, the compiler will look up definition of \"moduleA.js\" in ./moduleA.ts or ./moduleA.d.ts.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to be compatible with ES6 modules, which require the .js extension, as <script type=\"module\"></script> is standard in [evergreen browsers](https://caniuse.com/es6-module), and as for now TS doesn't provide an option to add the .js extension in transpiled files (see microsoft/TypeScript#13422).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\nAdd the resolve-typescript-plugin (or have an option to enable it) to the generated webpack config.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm just running a split project where the `server` package requires '.js' extensions and the 'client' package does not.

It works like this:\r\n```ts\r\n<div\r\n  appPopover\r\n  [isPopoverVisible]=\"isPopoverVisible()\"\r\n  [popoverTemplate]=\"popoverTemplate\"\r\n>\r\n   Regular content here\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #popoverTemplate> Popover content here </ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally, this directive fill open or destroy the popover depending on the `isPopoverVisible` input:\r\n```ts\r\neffect(() => {\r\n  if (this.isPopoverVisible()) {\r\n    this.openPopover();\r\n  } else {\r\n    this.destroyPopover();\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works welll, but when adding signals into the `popoverTemplate` I notice that any effects contained inside the `appPopover` directive will fire again. Even if none of the directive's inputs have changed.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n<div\r\n  appPopover\r\n  [isPopoverVisible]=\"isPopoverVisible()\"\r\n  [popoverTemplate]=\"popoverTemplate\"\r\n>\r\n   Regular content here\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #popoverTemplate> {{ someSignal() }} </ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `someSignal` changes, my effect inside the `appPopover` directive will now fire _again_, even though none of its inputs have changed (only the input of the template we pass in has changed).\r\n\r\nThis feels unintentional, I'd like to know if this is intended behaviour, or a bug in the framework.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kfrancois/angular-effects-repro\r\n\r\nAlso available in Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/kfrancois/angular-effects-repro\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nUsing the above link, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1.

It's working perfectly, both with `ng build` and `ng serve`. It uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` builder. To support a new feature, I needed to swap a file when running the live-reload mode with `ng serve`. Following the documentation for `fileReplacements`, I added:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n            \"serve\": {\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n              \"ssr\": false\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI now get the following error when running `ng serve`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe regex pattern does not match what builds without replacement are actually using. Regular builds support `\"\\.(([cm]?[jt])sx?|json)$\"`. However, the pattern itself is questionable: why even limit the file extensions here? I don't need it right now, but what if I wanted to swap a `.wasm` file or any other kind of file? If a regular build works, adding a file replacement rule should never restrict it more.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd a file replacement rule targeting an `mts` file. Example:\r\n```\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the corresponding command (`ng build`, `ng serve`)\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n$ ng version\r\nNode.js version v21.6.1 detected.\r\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

I will fallback and so on.\r\n\r\nI tried even with the build in http client but even that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.http.get(`/numbro_languages/${localeId}.min.js`, {responseType:'arraybuffer'}).pipe(\r\n      catchError(this.handleError())\r\n    ).subscribe((value) => {\r\n            console.log(value);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nit already report something even if i have a pipe with a catchErrror\r\n\r\n\r\nbesides that the locales for Numbro that i need to load seems to work really different..\r\ninstead of just doing this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  return import(`numbro/languages/${localeId}`).then(module => {\r\n            numbro.registerLanguage(module.default);\r\n            numbro.setLanguage(localeId);\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\ni now need todo this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n return import(`/numbro_languages/${localeId}.min.js`).then(module => {\r\n            numbro.registerLanguage(this.windowService.nativeWindow['numbro'][localeId]);\r\n            numbro.setLanguage(localeId);\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause that min.js file looks like this that numbro ships:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst u = undefined;\r\nfunction plural(val) {\r\n    const n = val, i = Math.floor(Math.abs(val)), v = val.toString().replace(/^[^.]*\\.?/, '').length;\r\n    if (i === 1 && v === 0)\r\n        return 1;\r\n    return 5;\r\n}\r\nexport default [\"nl\", [[\"a.m.\", \"p.m.\"], u, u], u, [[\"Z\", \"M\", \"D\", \"W\", \"D\", \"V\", \"Z\"], [\"zo\", \"ma\", \"di\", \"wo\", \"do\", \"vr\", \"za\"], [\"zondag\", \"maandag\", \"dinsdag\", \"woensdag\", \"donderdag\", \"vrijdag\", \"zaterdag\"], [\"zo\", \"ma\", \"di\", \"wo\", \"do\", \"vr\", \"za\"]], u, [[\"J\", \"F\", \"M\", \"A\", \"M\", \"J\", \"J\", \"A\", \"S\", \"O\", \"N\", \"D\"], [\"jan.\", \"feb.\", \"mrt.\", \"apr.\", \"mei\", \"jun.\", \"jul.\", \"aug.\", \"sep.\", \"okt.\", \"nov.\", \"dec.\"], [\"januari\", \"februari\", \"maart\", \"april\", \"mei\", \"juni\", \"juli\", \"augustus\", \"september\", \"oktober\", \"november\", \"december\"]], u, [[\"v.C.\", \"n.C.\"], [\"v.Chr.\", \"n.Chr.\"], [\"voor Christus\", \"na Christus\"]], 1, [6, 0], [\"dd-MM-y\", \"d MMM y\", \"d MMMM y\", \"EEEE d MMMM y\"], [\"HH:mm\", \"HH:mm:ss\", \"HH:mm:ss z\", \"HH:mm:ss zzzz\"], [\"{1} {0}\", u, \"{1} 'om' {0}\", u], [\",\", \".\", \";\", \"%\", \"+\", \"-\", \"E\", \"×\", \"‰\", \"∞\", \"NaN\", \":\"], [\"#,##0.###\", \"#,##0%\", \"¤ #,##0.00;¤ -#,##0.00\", \"#E0\"], \"EUR\", \"€\", \"Euro\", { \"AUD\": [\"AU$\", \"$\"], \"BYN\": [u, \"р.\"], \"CAD\": [\"C$\", \"$\"], \"FJD\": [\"FJ$\", \"$\"], \"JPY\": [\"JP¥\", \"¥\"], \"PHP\": [u, \"₱\"], \"RUR\": [u, \"р.\"], \"SBD\": [\"SI$\", \"$\"], \"THB\": [\"฿\"], \"TWD\": [\"NT$\"], \"USD\": [\"US$\", \"$\"], \"XPF\": [], \"XXX\": [] }, \"ltr\", plural];\r\n```\r\n\r\nor another version that they also ship is\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    languageTag: \"nl-NL\",\r\n    delimiters: {\r\n        thousands: \".\",\r\n        decimal: \",\"\r\n    },\r\n    abbreviations: {\r\n        thousand: \"k\",\r\n        million: \"mln\",\r\n        billion: \"mrd\",\r\n        trillion: \"bln\"\r\n    },\r\n    ordinal: (number) => {\r\n        let remainder = number % 100;\r\n        return (number !== 0 && remainder <= 1 || remainder === 8 || remainder >= 20) ?

Those templates are made for a specific CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 4). Developers using this framework might have or want to use a different CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 5). I want to update the framework to support multiple of those CSS/HTML Libraries. Unfortunately there is no option in angular at the moment to reach this goal, so all the logic must be applied before starting the building process. Also multiple html files make the project more complex. It would be better to have a preprocessor (like in C or other languages) to mark an area in the html template to be used if a compiler flag was set or some environment variable was set. One html template can contain html code for several different CSS/HTML Libraries.\r\n\r\nWhy a preprocessor step? I can also achieve the same by setting a global variable and some *ngIf statements in the html. But those logic + additional html for all CSS/HTML Libraries will be stored in the final product and generates an unnecessary overhead.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroducing variables which are considered at compile time, to include / not include parts of the html template. Those variables must be global or can be configured in the angular.json as an option like:\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap4\"}\r\n\r\nin another project\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap5\"}\r\n\r\nand used in the html template (example can be different)\r\n\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap4>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 4 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap5>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 5 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEnhance the optimizier, to remove parts of the html which are not used at all. For example, a const global variable which will never change and set to value like \"bootstrap4\" / \"bootstrap5\" must be considered.\r\n\r\nIssues / Problems: Global variables can't be used in html templates and must be re-defined in components. The variable in the component is not a global variable anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27134","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for multiple CSS Frameworks / Partial Build depends on Environment Variables\" (#27134)"},{"Id":"2138589816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T13:04:39","Actor":"gingters","Number":"27119","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve / ng build does not work on Windows dev drive mounted as a volume","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI'm on Windows 11, using a [dev drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/) ( `D:` ).

So the application won't start. When running `ng build` from the mounted volume the same problem can be seen. Both script tags are missing in the generated file.\r\n\r\nThere is also no output that would hint at a problem.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: It should workl.\r\nAlternatively, if it won't generate the script tags, it should at least print a warning or error to the console that something is wrong and the generated application won't run, and maybe not running the command from a mounted volume but directly onthe volume should be done instead. That said, i would be really unhappy with that alternative.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nng new on mounted dev drive\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere is no exception.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.2.0\r\nNode: 21.6.1 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1702.0 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.2.0 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.2.0 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          17.2.0 (cli-only)\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve / ng build does not work on Windows dev drive mounted as a volume\" (#27119)"},{"Id":"2138560973","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T12:48:57","Actor":"nicojs","Number":"27117","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to debug jest tests?","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\ntest\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHow does one debug jest tests?\r\n\r\nDebugging a normal `jest` test run is documented here: https://jestjs.io/docs/troubleshooting#debugging-in-vs-code.

It can run the build step before jest runs. This allows us to run  `jest --runInBand` ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to add a `--runInBand` ng test flag for jest.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've currently invented a workaround. Unfortunately, without a proper `ng test --build` command, I had to revert to `ng test || exit 0`. This will build _and run the tests once_ before debugging can start. The necessary `sourceMapPathOverrides` are hideous as well 🙈\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>launch.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ng test (jest)\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm: test:build\",\r\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n        \"--experimental-vm-modules\",\r\n        \"./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js\",\r\n        \"--runInBand\",\r\n        \"--rootDir\",\r\n        \"${workspaceFolder}/dist/test-out/browser\",\r\n        \"--testMatch\",\r\n        \"**/?(*.)+(spec|test).mjs\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\r\n        \"src/app/*\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src/app/*\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"outputCapture\": \"std\",\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.mjs\"]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>package.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"test:build\": \"npm test || exit 0\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</summary>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to debug jest tests?\" (#27117)"},{"Id":"2138549250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T12:41:15","Actor":"sod","Number":"27116","RawContent":null,"Title":"`externalPackagesPlugin` slows down `ng serve` substantially","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] Kinda, as the `externalPackagesPlugin` was just added via https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923 existed, which was part of [17.1.1](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.1), so I guess angular [17.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.0)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nangular 17.2.0\r\nvite/esbuild powered application builder\r\n\r\nUsing the `loader` option in `angular.json` like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\", \".svg\": \"text\" },\r\n```\r\n\r\nto support images as ecmascript imports or svgs as inline. This causes angular-cli to add the `externalPackagesPlugin` which is a giant hit on build performance. For our apps:\r\n\r\n| angular version | watch rebuild time |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| angular 17.1.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `0.8 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.1.1 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.2.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n\r\nThose additional 5.2 seconds are also added to the initial build.\r\n\r\nMy rough idea of the issue is, that the `externalPackagesPlugin` looks at every single import that doesn't start with `.` or `/` and doesn't cache the results. So tons of `@angular/...`, `rxjs`, `@ngrx/...` and similar imports are resolved over and over again. Even if this function only needs 2ms to run, this quickly adds up.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sod/ng-serve-external-deps-slowdown\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/905328/88202539-c585-4240-b0b3-98154559cc73)\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the `development` and `development-slow` configurations in the angular.json are:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n            \"development\": {\r\n            },\r\n

[`v0.20.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0201)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1)\n\n-   Fix a bug with the CSS nesting transform ([#&#8203;3648](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3648))\n\n    This release fixes a bug with the CSS nesting transform for older browsers where the generated CSS could be incorrect if a selector list contained a pseudo element followed by another selector. The bug was caused by incorrectly mutating the parent rule's selector list when filtering out pseudo elements for the child rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      &:after,\n      & .bar {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo .bar,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo:after,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Constant folding for JavaScript inequality operators ([#&#8203;3645](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3645))\n\n    This release introduces constant folding for the `< > <= >=` operators. The minifier will now replace these operators with `true` or `false` when both sides are compile-time numeric or string constants:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(1 < 2, '🍕' > '🧀')\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(1<2,\"🍕\">\"🧀\");\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(!0,!1);\n    ```\n\n-   Better handling of `__proto__` edge cases ([#&#8203;3651](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3651))\n\n    JavaScript object literal syntax contains a special case where a non-computed property with a key of `__proto__` sets the prototype of the object. This does not apply to computed properties or to properties that use the shorthand property syntax introduced in ES6. Previously esbuild didn't correctly preserve the \"sets the prototype\" status of properties inside an object literal, meaning a property that sets the prototype could accidentally be transformed into one that doesn't and vice versa. This has now been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ } // Note: sets the prototype\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__ = proto\n        return { __proto__ } // Note: doesn't set the prototype\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__ }; // Note: no longer sets the prototype (WRONG)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { __proto__: __proto__2 }; // Note: now sets the prototype (WRONG)\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ }; // Note: sets the prototype (correct)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { [\"__proto__\"]: __proto__2 }; // Note: doesn't set the prototype (correct)\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix cross-platform non-determinism with CSS color space transformations ([#&#8203;3650](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3650))\n\n    The Go compiler takes advantage of \"fused multiply and add\" (FMA) instructions on certain processors which do the operation `x*y + z` without intermediate rounding. This causes esbuild's CSS color space math to differ on different processors (currently `ppc64le` and `s390x`), which breaks esbuild's guarantee of deterministic output. To avoid this, esbuild's color space math now inserts a `float64()` cast around every single math operation. This tells the Go compiler not to use the FMA optimization.\n\n-   Fix a crash when resolving a path from a directory that doesn't exist ([#&#8203;3634](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3634))\n\n    This release fixes a regression where esbuild could crash when resolving an absolute path if the source directory for the path resolution operation doesn't exist. While this situation doesn't normally come up, it could come up when running esbuild concurrently with another operation that mutates the file system as esbuild is doing a build (such as using `git` to switch branches). The underlying problem was a regression that was introduced in version 0.18.0.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents (https-proxy-agent)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.4`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#704)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@7.0.3...https-proxy-agent@7.0.4)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   [`b88ab46`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/b88ab46): Import `url` instead of `node:url` 🤷‍♂️\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.15`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>piscinajs/piscina (piscina)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.2`](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#432-2024-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.2)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.12.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.11.0...v4.12.0)\n\n*2024-02-16*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Improve raw bundling performance by 10-15% when not using the cache or plugins that return an AST ([#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5391))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5391): Improve performance by directly constructing AST from buffer ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5393](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5393): chore(deps): update dependency eslint-plugin-unicorn to v51 ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5394](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5394): chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v7 (major) ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5395](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5395): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.71.1`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1711)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.71.0...1.71.1)\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Ship the musl Linux release with the proper Dart executable.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Export the `NodePackageImporter` class in ESM mode.\n\n-   Allow `NodePackageImporter` to locate a default directory even when the\n    entrypoint is an ESM module.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Make passing a null argument to `NodePackageImporter()` a static error rather\n    than just a runtime error.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   In the JS Embedded Host, properly install the musl Linux embedded compiler\n    when running on musl Linux.\n\n### [`v1.71.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1710)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.70.0...1.71.0)\n\nFor more information about `pkg:` importers, see [the\nannouncement][pkg-importers] on the Sass blog.\n\n[pkg-importers]: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-pkg-importers\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Add a `--pkg-importer` flag to enable built-in `pkg:` importers.

It appears to be a deliberate design choice, as Material 3 themes exclusively generate CSS custom variables.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we have two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. **SCSS Mixin Approach:**\r\n   Add an SCSS mixin that generates all `mat-elevation-z*` classes from 0 to 24, applying the necessary `box-shadow` rules. Here's an example of the mixin:\r\n   ```scss\r\n   @mixin elevations() {\r\n     @for $elevation from 0 to 24 {\r\n       .mat-elevation-z#{$elevation} {\r\n         @include mat.elevation($elevation);\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Directive Update Approach:**\r\n   Remove the usage of `mat-elevation-z*` classes in all directives (e.g., `mat-menu`), replacing them with the `box-shadow` CSS rule. Utilize a CSS custom property for flexibility, such as:\r\n   ```css\r\n   var(--mat-elevation-shadow-z8) or var(--mat-menu-shadow)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nAdditional Suggestion:\r\nIntroduce a theme API, `mat.get-shadow`, which returns the `box-shadow` for a given elevation value. This API would function similarly to the existing `mat.elevation(x)` mixin but solely returns the value without applying it.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements aim to provide flexibility and address the missing `box-shadow` rule in a manner consistent with the Material 3 design choices.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-n9d5rj\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click on menu button\r\n2.

As you are aware, Material 3 for the web heavily relies on CSS custom properties, and this adjustment would be more in line with the framework's theming approach.\r\n\r\nThe suggested change aligns with Material 3's philosophy of emitting only CSS custom property declarations, avoiding standard CSS properties (refer to https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#applying-your-theme). Importantly, this approach remains fully compatible with the current Material 2 themes implementation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, incorporating CSS custom properties will streamline the organization of CSS rules by allowing them to be centralized directly in the component's stylesheet. This centralization mitigates the challenges associated with splitting rules across multiple files, resulting in a more manageable and less error-prone maintenance process. It is worth noting that this approach enhances component autonomy, making theming optional, as custom properties can be set outside of a theme. This flexibility ensures a smoother development and maintenance experience.\r\n\r\nImplementing this proposal would greatly assist developers in their future migration from Material 2 to 3, requiring only changes to flat custom properties isolated in mixins. Additionally, it opens the door to granular customizations with CSS custom properties (see https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#granular-customizations-with-css-custom-properties) even before material 3 integration becomes stable. Embracing CSS custom properties aligns with modern best practices and ensures future-proofing.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this proposal.\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// carousel.scss\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  color: var(--app-carousel-color);\r\n  font-family: var(--app-carousel-font-family);\r\n  padding: var(--app-carousel-padding);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: var(--app-carousel-shape, 4px);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-color: #{mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-font-family: #{mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin density($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-padding: #{48px + (2px * mat.get-theme-density($theme))};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28612","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Change components theming guide to encourage css custom properties\" (#28612)"},{"Id":"2141888232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T09:46:14","Actor":"landoephan","Number":"28611","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): programmatically focused link gets focused, but the style doesn't apply","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to focus a link programmatically.

Specifically, using a fixed width or setting it to 100% results in unexpected behavior. When setting the width to 100%, the dialog is pushed to the left instead of occupying the entire viewport width. This inconsistency in behavior hampers the intended layout and user experience. Further investigation is required to identify the root cause and implement a suitable solution.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://ng-comp-devapp.web.app/dialog\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n1. When setting the width of the dialog element using a fixed value (e.g., pixels), the dialog should render with the specified width without any distortion or unexpected positioning.\r\n2. When setting the width of the dialog element to 100%, it should occupy the entire width of the viewport, ensuring that it is centered horizontally and does not get pushed to the left or right edges of the screen.\r\n3. The dialog should maintain responsiveness, adjusting its width dynamically based on the viewport size while adhering to the specified width constraints.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n1. When setting the width of the dialog element using a fixed value, the dialog may render with the specified width, but it might not align properly within the viewport or may not respect the specified width, leading to unexpected layout issues.\r\n2. When setting the width of the dialog element to 100%, it may not occupy the entire width of the viewport as intended. Instead, it might get pushed to the left side of the screen, causing it to appear off-center or misaligned.\r\n3. The responsiveness of the dialog may be compromised, with the width not adjusting appropriately based on the viewport size, leading to inconsistent presentation across different devices or screen sizes.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 17.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrinr\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macos\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"m3 Issue with Dialog Width Property\" (#28604)"},{"Id":"2136083625","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-17T08:02:49","Actor":"liesahead","Number":"28597","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(expansion panel): toggle does not have a border-color set explicitly.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there are such styles for expansion panel toggle\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n.mat-expansion-indicator::after {\r\n    ...\r\n    color: var(--mat-expansion-header-indicator-color);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in our case (we use tailwind CSS) we have such global styles (note that it has lower specificity):\r\n```CSS\r\n*, ::before, ::after {\r\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd these styles override the color of the toggle because it's actually a `border`.

Prior to Angular 19, the same setup worked perfectly without any issues.\n\nI initially suspected it could be related to my specific project setup. However, creating a fresh Angular project and integrating Capacitor leads to the same blank page issue, indicating it might be related to Angular 19 compatibility with Capacitor.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate a new Angular project:\n\n```\nng new capacitor-test\ncd capacitor-test\nng add @capacitor/core\nnpm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios\n\n```\nConfigure the capacitor.config.ts file as follows:\n\n```\nimport type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';\n\nconst config: CapacitorConfig = {\n  appId: 'com.test.app',\n  appName: 'CapacitorTest',\n  webDir: 'dist/capacitor-test/browser/',\n  loggingBehavior: 'debug',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nBuild the project:\n\n`ng build --output-path=dist/capacitor-test/browser/`\n\nAdd the Android platform and run the app on a connected device:\n\n```\nnpx cap add android\nnpx cap sync android\nnpx cap open android\n```\n\nObserve the application output on the device. A blank page appears.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59334","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blank Page in Capacitor App After Upgrading to Angular 19\" (#59334)"},{"Id":"2763504354","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T17:33:39","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59333","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): replace `mapTo` since deprecated","State":"open","Body":"Replaces `mapTo` with `map` because, in RxJS, `mapTo` is deprecated and internally uses `map`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59333","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): replace `mapTo` since deprecated\" (#59333)"},{"Id":"2763418386","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T16:13:03","Actor":"aalamu","Number":"59332","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `oneOfValidator` for validating control values against a set of allowed values","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\n### Description:\n\nI would like to propose the addition of a new custom validator called `oneOfValidator` to Angular's forms library. This validator checks if the value of a form control matches one of the allowed values from a list, which can be an array of numbers, strings, or an object.\n\nThe validator would return an error object if the value of the control is not included in the allowed values list, and it will include both the invalid value and the allowed values in the response.\n\nThis feature can be useful when you want to restrict input to a specific set of values but need the flexibility to support different types (numbers, strings, or objects).\n\n### Feature Details:\n\n1. **Validator Function:**\n\n```typescript\nexport function oneOfValidator(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  const values: number[] | string[] = toOneOfList(value);\n\n  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {\n    // Check if the control is valid and has a value\n    if (control && control.value) {\n      const value: string = control.value;\n\n      // Check if the control's value is not in the list of allowed values\n      if (!value.includes(value)) {\n        // Return an object containing the invalid value and allowed values\n        return { oneOf: value, allowedValues: values };\n      }\n    }\n    // Return null if the value is valid or the control is not set\n    return null;\n  };\n}\n\nstatic oneOf(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  return oneOfValidator(value);\n}\n\nfunction toOneOfList(value: number[] | string[] | object): number[] | string[] {\n  let valuesArray: number[] | string[] = [];\n  if (typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = Object.keys(value);\n  } else if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = value;\n  }\n  return valuesArray;\n}\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### Simple Usage Example:\n\n```typescript\n// Using oneOf with an array of numbers\noneOf([1, 2, 3]);\n\n// Using oneOf with an array of strings\noneOf(['a', 'b', 'c']);\n\n// Using oneOf with an enum\nenum Gender {\n  Male = 'Male',\n  Female = 'Female',\n  Other = 'Other'\n}\n\noneOf(Gender);\n````\n\n### Alternatives Considered:\n\n1. Custom ngModel Validator: Considered implementing a custom validator for each form control directly in the component. However, this would lead to more verbose code and less reusability across different form controls.\n\n2. Manual Value Checking in Components: Another option was manually checking if the control's value is in the allowed list within the component, but this would require repetitive code and diminish maintainability.\n\n3. Third-Party Validation Libraries: Considered using external libraries for form validation, but chose not to introduce dependencies, preferring to keep the solution within Angular's built-in form validation system for simplicity and consistency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add `oneOfValidator` for validating control values against

Instead, it falls back into the default `<ng-content />` element if one exists or doesn't get injected at all otherwise.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n1. Create an `app-clild` component with content projection using `<ng-content select=\".slot\">`.\n2. Create a parent component that uses this child component in two ways:\n   - With a single condition: `<app-clild> @if (true) {<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>}</app-clild>`\n   - With nested conditions: `<app-clild> @if (true) { @if (true) {<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>} }</app-clild>`\n\n## Expected Behavior\nBoth approaches should result in identical DOM structures where the projected `<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>` is visible\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Single condition works correctly: `Slot content` is projected\n- Nested conditions fail: `Slot content` is not shown\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xsmwxmhw?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59330","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested `@if` breaks multi-slot content projection\" (#59330)"},{"Id":"2762525784","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T01:07:37","Actor":"sumitarora","Number":"59329","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(devtools): fixing dark mode colors for devtools and router tree","State":"open","Body":"- added dark mode colors for devtools and router tree  \r\n- fixed the router tree legend rerendering issue\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1331\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188f3005-8f3e-4d02-a99e-7b3197dbdf61\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"871\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/484ab358-640d-4ea3-a658-49216a176e09\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1170\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e02efff-77dc-4fe6-a90a-7647b14e7d67\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59329","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(devtools): fixing dark mode colors for devtools and router tree\" (#59329)"},{"Id":"2761010496","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-29T09:00:55","Actor":"muhamedkarajic","Number":"59318","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 19 initial state change asynchronously scss triggering animations","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nLitteraly my navigation bar is transitioning when opening the page from visible to not visibe in Angular 19 while on Angular 18 it was when opening the page in the right state not visible.

If I create my form all at once... that is to say I create all the child forms in the object at the same time, the validity tracking works. If instead, I set one child form to null, then on the next line of code I set that null property to a new child form, the validity tracking is broken. \n\nIn the stackblitz example, I am building 3 instances of the same reactive form, but it's being built 3 times in different sets of steps as described above. To see the issue illustrated:\n   1. Delete the contents of the first Test Input, which has the 'required' validator on it. You will see all 6 'valid' booleans above the input change from 'true' to 'false', because the validation issue has propagated up the chain to all the ancestor forms. Now type something into the input and again you'll see all 6 booleans change back to 'true' because the validity has propagated up the chain successfully. \n   \n   2. Perform the same steps on the 2nd Test Input. Here you will see the booleans do not all update, as if the propagation is broken. Now type something into the input again and see the same 5 booleans change back to 'true'. So the base form here is not getting the update and the only difference is that I set the 'first' form to null and then created it on the next line. \n   \n   3. Repeat the same steps on the 3rd Test Input and see how the propagation is further broken here, as only 3 booleans update this time now that I'm also setting the 'second' form to null and then setting it on the next line. \n\nIs this expected behavior? This is an ultra-simplified example. In my real use case, we create the base form but we don't have the data yet to hydrate the children forms, so we have null checks if the data isn't there and we don't create those forms yet. Later when the user performs an action and we retrieve the data from the API, we create a form on those child properties. We have a large nested form where we are highlighting things red in the UI when the form or it's children forms are invalid. So if we instead create blank children forms, we'd have to go and disable the form controls to ensure they aren't counted invalid, which is a hassle. It's much cleaner to just check null AND invalid, but it's not working due to this bug.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa6f2249-9d26-4b4b-b2ef-1aa537d93f6d)\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-9rojtqfs?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere is no exception, just broken behavior\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.0\n@schematics/angular          19.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n\n\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"^7.8.1\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.5.0\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/build\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.6.3\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Setting form null during creation breaks chain of validity updates\" (#59309)"},{"Id":"2759791588","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:41:46","Actor":"khalilou88","Number":"59308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ability to not generate the host element","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHi,\nI like to use Angular to inline svg files in the template but the host element make them hard to style from the parent element like a button.\nIn my case, the host element need just inputs to overrides css styles, so I wish that Angular add a type of components that don't add a extra Dom element.\n\nThank you\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a type of components that don't add a extra Dom element a least for svg files.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe current solution is working fine, just add more steps to style svg files and an extra dom element","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to not generate the host element\" (#59308)"},{"Id":"2759752303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:29:08","Actor":"mehedihasansjs","Number":"59307","RawContent":null,"Title":"string type control can be used on number type input field","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have declared a control with type string.\n \n```typescript\ncontrol = new FormControl<string>('')\n```\n\nbut I have applied the control on number type input field\n\n```html\n<input type=\"number\" formControlName=\"control\" />\n```\n\nThe control in the ends returns the value type number, but when I access the API of control's value I can only get string's API.\n\nMy suggestion is, either we can show error or warning if string type control returns value as number, or we can cast the value to string and bind to control's value.\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Version: 17.3.7\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59307","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"string type control can be used on number type input field\" (#59307)"},{"Id":"2759743061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-26T13:18:36","Actor":"mehedihasansjs","Number":"59306","RawContent":null,"Title":"minLength, maxLength validators does not work on number type value of control and does not throw error","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have used a control which returns value `number`. for validating max and min length, I have used `Validators.minLength` and `Validators.maxLength` also used `Validators.required`.

Are you trying to bundle for node? You can use \"platform: 'node'\" to do that, which will remove this error.\n\n\n\nTherefore, my issues are:\n\n1. SSG should have some sort of way to load static assets. \n2.

This project contains ten thousand components, which are distributed into one hundred modules. These codes take up approximately 20MB of disk space. When I execute the default dev-server builder, it takes about 300 seconds or so. Then, when performing an incremental build after modifying the files for the first time, it also takes around 300 seconds to complete the build. And the incremental compilation time after modifying the files later is about 15 seconds or so. Moreover, it occupies a huge amount of memory. The processes of Node.js and Esbuild take up approximately 14GB of memory.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/xjlzy/test.git\nThis is the git repository address of my local test code. You just need to run it and you'll be able to know the specific situation.

However, when the same functionality is moved to an imported function in a separate file, the build fails with the error: **\"An error occurred while extracting routes.\"**\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**1. Create an API route directly in server.ts(works fine during build):**\n\n```\napp.get('/api/ping', (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  return res.json({\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    message: 'Ok'\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Refactor the response logic into a separate file, ping.controller.ts:**\n\n```\nexport default () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        uptime: process.uptime(),\n        message: 'Ok'\n      });\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**3. Import and use the ping.controller.ts function in server.ts(throws error during build)**\n\n```\nimport pingResponse from './controllers/ping.controller';\n\napp.get('/api/ping', async (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp: any = await pingResponse();\n  return res.json(resp);\n});\n\n```\n\n**4. Generate build using:**\n\n`npm run build`\n\n**5. angular.json config**\n\n```\n\"server\": \"src/main.server.ts\",\n\"outputMode\": \"server\",\n\"ssr\": {\n  \"entry\": \"src/server.ts\"\n}\n\n```\nI cannot move all the functions internally as all my routes rely on repository-based database queries, which are modular and imported from separate files. How to resolve this issue and ensure the Angular SSR build works with these imported functions?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

However, all components appear too dark regardless of the target color, and there is no single-line solution to specify a base color tone for all components since `--mat-sys-primary` is hardcoded to the tone value `40` by the theme mixin.\n\nUnfortunately, with Material v19, picking colors from the theme no longer works. You can still specify a material theme using `$app-theme: mat.define-theme(...)` with some restrictions, but applying it using the new mixin `@include mat.theme($app-theme)` doesn't work.\n\n**So please provide clean and simple solution to:**\n\n**1. Specify and reuse a theme object**\nFor example:\n```scss\n// Define theme object\n$app_theme: mat.define-theme((\n color: (primary: $primary-palette), \n...\n)); // Like it was in Material 18\n\n// then use this theme object to apply theme or get theme color:\n@include mat.theme($app-theme);\n$theme-color: mat.get-theme-color($app-theme, primary, 70);\n\n```\n**2. Specify a base color tone for all components at once**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme((\n    color: (\n      theme-type: light,\n      primary: themes.$app-theme-palette, // Generated color palette\n      primary-color-tone: 70 // Here we specify which tone level to pick from color palette for --mat-sys-primary color\n      ...\n    )\n  ));\n```\n**_or as an alternative_** output all theme-palette tones as css variables, so we can easily reuse them to customize theme and component colors:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme-overrides((\n    primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-70),\n    on-primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-100)\n  ));\n\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    background-color: var(--mat-sys-primary-80); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n\n```\n\n**3. Specify a base color for a specific component (single-line override)**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    base-color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 30); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(all theming): Clean and reusable way to override all components theme colors\" (#30244)"},{"Id":"2752361306","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T19:01:35","Actor":"RafalSzczuka","Number":"30223","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Timepicker): timepicker control error state too early","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTimepicker dropdown marks touched state differently than regular select dropdown or datepicker select.

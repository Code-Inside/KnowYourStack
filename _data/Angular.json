The pipe is used in a template, and the template is thus, indirectly, a \"client\" of the signal, so it seems logical that the template is updated when the signal changes\r\n2. The rules of OnPush have changed to benefit from signals: even if no input of an OnPush component have changed, the component is marked for check when a signal it reads has changed. A pure pipe is very similar, conceptually, to an OnPush component: it's reexecuted only when its arguments change. Since OnPush now also marks a component for check if a signal red by its template has changed, I'd argue that the same should be done for a pure pipe that reads a signal\r\n\r\nMaking such a change could change the behavior of existing pipes, but the current behavior could be achieved by reading the signal inside an untracked(). And OTOH, pipes that are currently marked as impure because they read a signal could become pure. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nReexecute the pipe even if its argument haven't changed in the case a signal that it reads has changed.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56401","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mark pure pipes dirty when a signal that they read changes \" (#56401)"},{"Id":"2348206904","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T09:10:19","Actor":"sbma24","Number":"56399","RawContent":null,"Title":"We detected an application built with production configuration.

This allows us to use the `assert` API for expressive assertions and print failures with more details.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that the test runner and the test file are actually executed as two separate processes. This means that we run `node --test` for _each_ test and print out N reports each containing exactly 1 test. This isn't ideal, but it's good enough for using assertions. We can also explore using `node --test` for the test runner just to print a single test report with all the tests listed. This might require running test code in process with the test runner.\r\n\r\n`node --test` is a little awkward in that it seems to treat all arguments as file paths to test, meaning there's no easy way to pass arguments into the tests. Since we're actually invoking our own test runner, we need to pass through the actual file being tested, but this is not easy to do with `node --test`. I feel like `node --test test_runner.js -- file_under_test.js` _should_ work, but actually doesn't. Instead, I opted to pass the file through as an environment variable. It's inelegant, but good enough for now.\r\n\r\nI also had to separate out running a _test_ from running an arbitrary process, which were previously using the same code path and conflicting with each other.\r\n\r\nExample output for a test failure: https://gist.github.com/dgp1130/e795d5d540ec98de7aac02a363f56998","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27835","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: use Node test runner for E2E tests\" (#27835)"},{"Id":"2349901955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-13T00:39:16","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"27834","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: re-enable WTR test","State":"open","Body":"This was disabled due to an issue with Puppeteer and Bazel which has been resolved by a simple version update.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27834","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: re-enable WTR test\" (#27834)"},{"Id":"2349669030","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T20:56:53","Actor":"csvn","Number":"27833","RawContent":null,"Title":"Worker and global style files do not respect `sourceMap.hidden`","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen setting `build.options.sourceMap.hidden` to `true`, there is two cases I've seen where `//# sourceMappingURL=` is still added to the bottom of the file: any scripts files added as worker, and for style files specified in `build.options.styles`. I cannot find a way to make all emitted files respect the `hidden` flag for sourcemaps.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new Angular project:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npx @angular/cli@latest new --style=css --ssr=false ng-repro\r\n   ```\r\n2. Add `angular.json` config to use hidden sourcemaps:\r\n   ```jsonc\r\n   \"build\": {\r\n     \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\r\n       \"options\": {\r\n         \"sourceMap\": {\r\n           \"hidden\": true,\r\n           \"scripts\": true,\r\n           \"styles\": true\r\n         },\r\n         // ...\r\n   ```\r\n3. Add a worker file at `src/main.worker.ts`:\r\n   ```ts\r\n   globalThis.postMessage('Hello! I am a worker!');\r\n   ```\r\n4. Import the worker in `main.ts`, by adding this at the bottom:\r\n   ```ts\r\n   const worker = new Worker(new URL('./main.worker', import.meta.url));\r\n   worker.addEventListener('message', e => console.log(e.data));\r\n   ```\r\n5. Run the build step:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npm run build\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nBy checking `styles-<hash>.css` and `worker-<hash>.js` in the `dist/<project>/browser` folder, we can see that at the bottom of both files there is a `//# sourceMappingURL=` mapping, and thus the sourcemap is not hidden.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.0.3\r\nNode: 22.2.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27833","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Worker and global style files do not respect `sourceMap.hidden`\" (#27833)"},{"Id":"2349602044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T20:11:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27832","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): improve console status logging for add command","State":"open","Body":"The step-based console UI of the add command has been refactored to use the `listr2` library.

See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434#issuecomment-1610298235 for more context.\r\n\r\nIf hiding the Jest configuration is a challenge for you, please consider if an alternative approach _without_ hooking into the Jest config is reasonable. Otherwise please post your use case to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434 so we can evaluate the best path forward for this feature.\r\n\r\nJest was incorrectly picking up custom configurations, even though they exist outside Jest's root directory. This commit fixes that behavior so Jest does not see user configurations and does not apply them. Ideally we would throw an error if a Jest configuration is found to be more clear that it isn't doing what developers expect. However they may use a Jest config to run other projects in the same workspace outside of Angular CLI and we don't want to prevent that. A warning seems like the best trade off of notifying users that a custom config isn't supported while also not preventing unrelated Jest usage in the same workspace.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a few issues where users were using a custom config either causing a problem or attempting to solve one. I want to be up front during the experimentation process what our current stance is for users playing around with Jest so we can collect feedback on how it impacts users earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26852","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix: ignore custom Jest configuration file and warn if one is found\" (#26852)"},{"Id":"2076977515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-11T15:51:04","Actor":"spock123","Number":"26851","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow extract-i18n to only add i18n tags that do not already exist in target translation file","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs it is now, running extract-i18n is pretty much useless, because once it's run, any consecutive runs will overwrite the translation file entries.\r\n\r\nThis means, that once run, any new translation tokens added to the project will have to be manually added to all translation files. \r\n\r\nOur use case: we are adding translations to a large site, with 5-8 languages. \r\nThe translation of the project will be a long process, and we cannot add tags to the entire project in one swift move.

When running the command 'ng build' parts of my code get removed.\r\n\r\nIn my development library environnement (BUG): \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error:\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/carousel-library and npm i\r\n2.  (optional) Run 'ng serve -o'. Everything works as expected in development (nothing has been removed).\r\n3. Run 'ng build'\r\n![find folder dist](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/69f145b0-9849-45f8-8cad-4bc782789e39)\r\nFind the corresponding file in the compiled code in the dist folder and search for the method 'resetViewLeftDirection'. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;', which is necessary for forcing element reflow, has been removed.\r\n\r\nIn a existing project (BUG):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/Portfolio and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz (winrar) at root .\r\n2. Have a look at the ngx-carousel-ease in the node_modules/fesm2022/ngx-carousel-ease.mjs.map. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n![inside node_modules](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/2606ab3b-67b9-426b-abcc-3138681e8e0f)\r\n3. Now run 'ng build' and find the corresponding file in the dist folder: \r\n![last line gone](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/faeee759-e62a-4f73-9f4e-c8e5ff11f1a4)\r\n'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' has been removed in the compiled code.\r\n\r\nIn a new project (WORKING):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/lib-carousel and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz at root .\r\n2. Run ng build\r\n3. Have a look at the corresponding compiled file in the dist folder. The 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why this is working in a new project, and not in my developement environnement nor in an existing project. I don't know if it's a regression bug. I expect it to be a configuration problem. I've tried to get the same tsconfig from the working project in not working ones, but was unable to find the problem. \r\n\r\nWhen shipped to npm, the code includes the missing lines. When running 'ng build'  this line got removed. Is this some aggressive optimisation from ng build ?

The problem is that each ripple registers itself with the `RippleEventManager` which needs to be notified on destroy so that it can dereference the DOM nodes and remove the event listeners.\r\n\r\nThese changes avoid the leaks by:\r\n1. Destroying the ripple when the trigger is destroyed.\r\n2. Cleaning up all the ripples when the ripple loader is destroyed.\r\n3.

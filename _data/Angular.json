I have a use case where we're being provided a externally build `FormControl`, which we'd like to treat as readonly effectively and would like to register for disabled handling but we'd want to clean it up once our own code goes out of scope (by which I mean someone externally calls `destroy` on our object).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nLooking at current implementation of FormControl, we'd just need to add `deregisterOnChange` and `deregisterOnDisabledChange` methods to the public API which allows the programmer to pass in the same function ref as one passed in during registration and internally the FormControl would do something like a `this._onChange = this._onChange.filter(fn => fn !== handler)` (where `handler` is an argument to the method). Same idea as `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`.\r\n\r\nIf this solution is viable, I can try to get it working and submit a PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n1. Current work around we've got involves casting to `any` and performing this removal ourselves.\r\n2. We could listen to `formControl.statusChanges` but I don't believe there is a `ENABLED` event but there is a `DISABLED` event? And I don't know what 'VALID' mean in this context? If there is a validation error but we do `enable()` what emits? `VALID`? `INVALID`? In my opinion this is confusing and hence in the application code I've decided to use `registerOnDiabledChange` instead of relying on `statusChanges` for keeping track of disabled changes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Methods on FormControl to allow de-registration of change and disabled handlers\" (#39390)"},{"Id":"727523345","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T16:03:56","Actor":"devpato","Number":"39389","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(features): traduccion de features.html","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It is then inserted into the view.\r\n```typescript\r\n@ViewChild(\"anchor\", { read: ViewContainerRef })\r\nanchor: ViewContainerRef;\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\nthis.compRef = this.cfr\r\n    .resolveComponentFactory(DynamicComponent)\r\n    .create(this.injector);\r\n\r\nthis.compRef.onDestroy(() =>\r\n    console.log(\"DynamicComponent onDestroyed callback\")\r\n);\r\n\r\nthis.anchor.insert(this.compRef.hostView);\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the `onDestroyed` callback is attached. If the component gets destroyed by its ComponentRef, the callback **gets called correctly** like so:\r\n```typescript\r\nthis.compRef.destroy();\r\n```\r\nif the component gets destroyed by clearing the `anchor`, the callback **does not get called**:\r\n```typescript\r\nthis.anchor.clear();\r\n```\r\nAs far as I can tell, the `onDestroyed` callback **ONLY** gets called when the component gets destroyed by its `ComponentRef`. Whenever the component gets destroyed by clearing parent views or navigating away or data binding, the callback does not get called.\r\n\r\nIt works in NG 8.2.14 and it works if you set `enableIvy: false` in tsconfig.json.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ev4v2y](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ev4v2y)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.6\r\nNode: 12.18.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-webworker, router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.6\r\n@angular/material               10.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.6\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.3\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ComponentRef<T> onDestroyed() callback does not get called\" (#39365)"},{"Id":"726440505","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-21T12:57:38","Actor":"munchkindev","Number":"39364","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat-icon gets displayed as text when you click on it or on later versions from the start","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/material/icon\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not sure whether this a regression, sorry..\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen I implemented my code on Angular 10.0.0.2 the following problem appeared: \r\nWhen I clicked on the mat-icon which is inside a span, which is inside a div I get a router redirect event fired and it completes but then the icon just turns into text saying feedback.

This means the reported progress is not very helpful or useful. Ideally, this should reflect the entirety of the `ng build` process to give more accurate measurement.\r\n\r\nUsers tend to think of percentage progress as representing time the process with take. Since it is very hard to know how long a given build step will take (for example, `tsc` and Terser tend to take the longest, while index file generation is pretty quick), it may make more sense to report steps rather than percentage. The CLI could print \"Executing step 4/9 - Compiling TypeScript\" to be more clear that 44% of build time has not passed, but rather we're running the 4th of 9 build steps, each of which could take an unspecified and non-equivalent length of time. We should also include a spinner just to show that work is being done, since individual build steps may take a long time and we don't want the user to think the CLI is frozen when it is not.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would have such progress reporting in all non-trivial CLI commands, but for now, we'll limit this issue to just `ng build` and `ng serve`, which is where users will be spending 99% of their time anyways.\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [X] build\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19181","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"More accurate progress reporting in `ng build`\" (#19181)"},{"Id":"727748198","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T21:59:41","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"19180","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add `rm -rf node_modules/` to release docs","State":"open","Body":"In the latest release, I was not able to build even after running `yarn` to refresh dependencies.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/11.0.0-next.6...11.0.0-rc.0)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **common:** update locales using new CLDR data ([#&#8203;39343](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39343)) ([3738233](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3738233))\n-   **compiler:** promote constants in templates to Trusted Types ([#&#8203;39211](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39211)) ([6e18d2d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6e18d2d))\n-   **core:** guard reading of global `ngDevMode` for undefined. ([#&#8203;36055](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36055)) ([f541e5f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f541e5f))\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] create compiler only when program changes ([#&#8203;39231](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39231)) ([8f1317f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8f1317f))\n-   **ngcc:** ensure that \"inline exports\" can be interpreted correctly ([#&#8203;39267](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39267)) ([822b838](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/822b838))\n-   **platform-server:** Resolve absolute URL from baseUrl ([#&#8203;39334](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39334)) ([b4e8399](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b4e8399))\n-   **router:** incorrect signature for createUrlTree ([#&#8203;39347](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39347)) ([161b278](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/161b278))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **compiler:** remove support for TypeScript 3.9 ([#&#8203;39313](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39313)) ([736e064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/736e064))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **platform-server:** If you use `useAbsoluteUrl` to setup `platform-server`, you now need to\n    also specify `baseUrl`.\n    We are intentionally making this a breaking change in a minor release,\n    because if `useAbsoluteUrl` is set to `true` then the behavior of the\n    application could be unpredictable, resulting in issues that are hard to\n    discover but could be affecting production environments.\n-   **compiler:** TypeScript 3.9 is no longer supported, please upgrade to TypeScript 4.0.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Because it used to work brilliantly. And now it just riddled with bugs. I'm trying to follow your upgrade guide 6 -> 7 LTS.\r\n\r\nI  managed to update `ng update @angular/cli@7 @angular/core@7` just fine, but next is Material update.\r\nI installed all deps manuallly and properly (swimlane charts , etc).\r\n\r\nNow I'm running material update and it **PULLS** angular **10**. Really?!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng update  @angular/material@7\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-charts\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"7.x\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-charts\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/animations\" (requires \"7.x\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/http\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"7.2.15\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-datatable\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/compiler\" (requires \"<8.0.0\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/http\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"7.2.15\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-charts\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"zone.js\" (requires \"^0.8.26\", would install \"0.10.3\").\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-charts\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/forms\" (requires \"7.x\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\n                  Package \"@swimlane/ngx-charts\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" (requires \"7.x\" (extended), would install \"10.1.6\").\r\nIncompatible peer dependencies found.

This should've been caught by CI/CD tools and testing. Do you actually have testing? If yes, why wasn't it caught?

This sounds a little like #16670\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using the `assets` key in the `angular.json` file, and having a rule that overlaps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n              \"assets\": [\r\n                \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n                \"src/assets\",\r\n                {\r\n                  \"input\": \"src/assets-replace\",\r\n                  \"output\": \"/assets\",\r\n                  \"glob\": \"**/*\"\r\n                }\r\n              ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe files from `src/assets-replace` will overwite the files in `src/assets` when using `ng build`, but it does not when using `ng serve`.\r\n\r\nWe use this functionality to have different themes of our own app. We use a different configuration for each theme, and have files with the same filename to replace the original logo, like the logo. This not working makes it a little hard to test whether theme changes work correctly.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n- Change `angular.json`, see assets example above.\r\n- Add an `image.png` in your assets folder, and display/show it in a component\r\n- Add an `assets-replace` folder in your `src` folder and put another `image.png` in it\r\n- Execute `ng serve` and see that it will display the image from `src/assets`\r\n- Execute `ng build` and see that it will display the image from `src/assets-replace`\r\n\r\nExample repro repo: https://github.com/jerbob92/angular-cli-assets-overwrite-bug\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 12.19.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.3\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19157","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng build and serve have different behaviour in overwriting assets when using assets key in angular.json\" (#19157)"},{"Id":"726352015","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-21T10:52:29","Actor":"rossmawd","Number":"19155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vulnerability of a dependency of @angular-devkit/build-angular","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nApologies if this is the wrong place to raise this.

In many cases, we want to leave the origin unchanged, but if there are cases that need the origin to be updated, allow for this with an optional origin param.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nIf the focus origin value is keyboard, and some interaction happens where we want to set focus to another element somewhere on the page by explicitly calling focus(), then in cases where the focus origin should remain the same, the current implementation causes the origin to change and the interaction to be weird. This is also due to the fact that we use a single, global focus monitor attached to the document body in eventual detection mode. \r\n\r\nHere are the components to update:\r\n-button\r\n-checkbox\r\n-menu item\r\n-menu trigger\r\n-radio\r\n-expansion panel header\r\n-slide toggle\r\n-step header\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20858","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(material): Allow focus origin to be an optional input to focus() methods.\" (#20858)"},{"Id":"726940776","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T16:49:44","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"20849","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"fix(material/slider): some screen readers announcing long dec…","State":"closed","Body":"…imal values (#20760)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 19f5f5ca398809011bad1edca061dd0a3004e235.\r\n\r\nReverting this for two reasons:\r\n* the truthiness check is a bit too broad, preventing someone\r\n  from setting the empty string or zero\r\n* I'd prefer to have the input named `valuetext` rather than `aria-valuetext`\r\n  since it's potentially confusing without supporting the `attr.`\r\n  (I know we do this elsewhere, but I'd like to avoid more use of\r\n  this pattern)\r\n\r\ncc @crisbeto ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20849","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"fix(material/slider): some screen readers announcing long dec…\" (#20849)"},{"Id":"727524082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T16:04:31","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"20856","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add husky ignored files to .gitignore","State":"open","Body":"Ahead of upgrading to husky v5, adding the shell file location\r\nto .gitignore to prevent it from randomly showing up when devs\r\ncheckout older branches.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20856","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: add husky ignored files to .gitignore\" (#20856)"},{"Id":"727508656","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T15:45:18","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20855","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to bazel 3.6","State":"open","Body":"Bumps the version of Bazel to 3.6 like in angular/angular in an attempt to resolve some of the recent CI flakes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20855","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update to bazel 3.6\" (#20855)"},{"Id":"727478476","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T15:09:19","Actor":"emmbee7806","Number":"20854","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(DatePicker): Allow custom footer","State":"open","Body":"#### Give option to add a custom footer for the date picker\r\n\r\nCurrently, there's only the option of adding a custom header to the date picker.\r\nIt would be really helpful if a custom footer is allowed as well.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nGiving an option of adding a custom footer will allow developers to add custom functionality to the picker.\r\n\r\nWill fix issue #11753\r\nWill also solve #5648 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20854","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(DatePicker): Allow custom footer\" (#20854)"},{"Id":"727478286","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-22T15:09:06","Actor":"tomastrajan","Number":"20853","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add search to material.angular.io","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nIt would be amazing if there would be a search field at the top toolbar where I could search for `button` or `card` and it would list links to relevant components (could also provide links directly to their API doc and Example page) so that I can quickly get the info I am interested in.\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:**  Such a search input could be in the top toolbar and hence available on every page.

Coalescing schedules change detection to be run in a way that the fake async zone cannot see, I think because of the `Zone.root.run()` used [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ecd5e6b75480fe167c81fd8db1bf952269a5d1a6/packages/core/src/zone/ng_zone.ts#L381). This causes the `NgZone` to be marked as having a microtask pending [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ecd5e6b75480fe167c81fd8db1bf952269a5d1a6/packages/core/src/zone/ng_zone.ts#L494), which never gets cleared. So as long as the zone thinks a microtask is pending it will never emit `onMicrotaskEmpty` nor `onStable` (see the check [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ecd5e6b75480fe167c81fd8db1bf952269a5d1a6/packages/core/src/zone/ng_zone.ts#L346)).\r\n\r\nUsers do not need to use `onMicrotaskEmpty` or `onStable` directly to be affected. I noticed this when using an `afterRender` hook, which is internally triggered by `onMicrotaskEmpty`. Here is a repro showing that situation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nit('runs coalesced change detection', fakeAsync(() => {\r\n  let ranAfterRenderHook = false;\r\n\r\n  @Component({ standalone: true, selector: 'app-inner' })\r\n  class InnerComponent {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n      // this is an inner component so that we can register this hook _after_\r\n      // dispatching an event\r\n      afterRender(() => {\r\n        ranAfterRenderHook = true;\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Component({\r\n    standalone: true,\r\n    imports: [InnerComponent],\r\n    template: `\r\n      <div class=\"clickable\" (click)=\"noop()\"></div>\r\n      @if (showInner) {\r\n        <app-inner />\r\n      }\r\n    `,\r\n  })\r\n  class OuterComponent {\r\n    showInner = false;\r\n    noop = () => {};\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    // change this to `false` and the test passes\r\n    providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true })],\r\n  });\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(OuterComponent);\r\n\r\n  document.querySelector('.clickable')!.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click'));\r\n  tick(); // you'd think this would flush the pending CD task, but it doesn't\r\n\r\n  fixture.componentInstance.showInner = true;\r\n  fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  tick(); // If afterRender is delayed, surely this should trigger it? Alas, no!\r\n\r\n  expect(ranAfterRenderHook).toBe(true);\r\n}));\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.5\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.5\r\nng-packagr                      18.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56767","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`eventCoalescing` breaks things in a `fakeAsync` test\" (#56767)"},{"Id":"2381823943","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-29T15:49:51","Actor":"komura-c","Number":"56766","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix missing image and baseUrl in tutorials/first-app","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If you project an `ng-content` into an `ng-content` that's in an `ng-template` (including for `ngIf` or `@if` blocks), hydration will fail with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentElement')`. This has occurred in a few places in my codebase which has a large component library featuring some complex components and variants of those components.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider a component with this template:\r\n```html\r\n<ng-content select=\"app-dropdown-trigger\"></ng-content>\r\n  <!-- this would normally be dynamic -->\r\n@if(false) {\r\n  <ng-content select=\"app-dropdown-content\"></ng-content>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this component directly and projecting content into the `ngIf` works fine and the component hydrates as expected. (note: `app-dropdown-content` also contains an `ng-content` here, so this is two levels of projection)\r\n\r\nHowever, if you add a wrapper component that makes a special case of it and projects into the `app-dropdown-content`, with a template like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<app-dropdown>\r\n  <app-dropdown-trigger>More</app-dropdown-trigger>\r\n  <app-dropdown-content>\r\n    <ng-content />\r\n  </app-dropdown-content>\r\n</app-dropdown>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this new component causes the server to fail with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentElement')`. This throws an actual error during SSR annotation and doesn't return a response.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when hydration is enabled on the element. Skipping hydration on the inner component (`app-dropdown`, in this case) doesn't fix the issue, but skipping hydration on the outer component does.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

It is the preferred option for new projects and we think migrating to it is a good idea. But we have found a small issue with how the static assets are served compared to the previous `browser` builder.\r\n\r\nOur application requires a bunch of static files to work, and one of the html files is accessed using the parent folder name without a trailing slash: `localhost:4200/oauth2redirect`. Using the previous builder this was loading the `oauth2redirect/index.html` file.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating to the new `application` builder, this same URI throws the following error:\r\n```\r\nError: NG04002: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'oauth2redirect'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding a trailing slash to the URI (`localhost:4200/oauth2redirect/`). But this would require updating our OAuth redirect uri. And since this is something already supported by other tools and platforms (Google Cloud Buckets for example), I think it may be a good idea to support it here as well.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd some static `index.html` to an angular project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/\r\n  app/...\r\n  static/\r\n    oauth2redirect/\r\n      index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n// angular.json\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n    \"input\": \"src/static\",\r\n    \"output\": \"/\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nServe the app\r\n```sh\r\nng serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd try to load the file by using its parent folder.\r\n\r\nAll three URIs work with previous `browser` builder. And the first one fails with the new `application`  builder.\r\n```sh\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect # => error\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/ # => loads the file\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/index.hmtl # => loads the file\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@angular/material               17.3.10\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27949","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"serve: serving static files using vite differs from the previous builder\" (#27949)"},{"Id":"2379848680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-28T13:37:52","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27958","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): redirect to path with trailing slash for asset directories","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, accessing a static asset directory without a trailing slash resulted in a 404 error.

To enable the optimization, script optimization must be enabled as well as an environment variable `NG_BUILD_OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS=1`. This build step uses `rollup` internally to process the build files directly in memory. The main bundling performs all resolution, bundling, and tree-shaking of the application. The chunk optimizer step then only needs to access the in-memory built files and does not need to perform any disk access or module resolution. This allows the step to be performed fairly quickly but it does add time to the overall production build. The `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF=1` environment variable can be used to view how long the step takes within a build via the `OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS` entry. In the future, this optimization step may be automatically enabled based on initial file entry count and size. There are several current known issues:\r\n1) Bundle budgets for named lazy chunks may not work as expected.\r\n2) The console output may not show names (files will be present) for lazy chunk files.\r\n3) The stats file (`--stats-json` option) will not exactly reflect the final written application files.

Now, let me explain my issue:\r\n\r\nIn my application, before adding localization, I was using a base href -> staffing which I have configured as follows in the following files:\r\n\r\n**angular.json**\r\n\"baseHref\": \"/staffing/\"\r\n\r\n**index.html**\r\n<base href=\"/staffing\">\r\n\r\n**main.ts**\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/staffing' },\r\n.....\r\n],\r\n}).catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n\r\nand it was working like a charm with all the urls using http://localhost:4200/staffing/....\r\n\r\nNow I add localization 'en' and 'es', and this as you know generates two builds folders dist/app-name/en and es.\r\nFrom the deploy point of view, I have to change the configuration, I had before angularapp folder and now angularapp/es and angularapp/en I changed the location path in nginx and started receiving this error.\r\n\r\npolyfills.9e8d107e6201c474.js/:1 Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm building an application that can load component templates from anywhere and use them as dynamic components in my application. With a fresh Angular 18 setup, this works perfectly fine, even with AOT, but when switching to the webpack builder (which we unfortunately need for unrelated reasons), I'm getting trouble with not being able to use any imported modules (including, e.g., CommonModule).\r\n\r\nWithout AOT, everything works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/aueelis/dynamic-template-issue\r\n\r\nIn `main.ts`, I fetch the `dynamic-template.html`, which is then used to create a simple `DynamicComponent`. This is then declared in a `DynamicModule`, which is also importing the `CommonModule` to support `*ngIf`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <ng-template #dynamicContainer></ng-template>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  name = 'Angular';\r\n\r\n  @ViewChild('dynamicContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true })\r\n  dynamicContainer: ViewContainerRef = {} as ViewContainerRef;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\r\n    this.httpClient\r\n      .get('dynamic-template.html', { responseType: 'text' })\r\n      .subscribe((template) => this.useTemplate(template));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private useTemplate(template: string): void {\r\n    const { component, moduleRef } = this.createDynamic(template);\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.clear();\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.createComponent(component, {\r\n      environmentInjector: moduleRef.injector,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createDynamic(template: string): {\r\n    component: any;\r\n    moduleRef: NgModuleRef<any>;\r\n  } {\r\n    const component = this.createComponent(template);\r\n    const module = this.createModule(component);\r\n    const moduleRef = createNgModule(module, this.dynamicContainer.injector);\r\n\r\n    return { component, moduleRef };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createComponent(template: string) {\r\n    return Component({\r\n      template,\r\n    })(class DynamicComponent {});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createModule(component: any) {\r\n    return NgModule({\r\n      imports: [CommonModule],\r\n      declarations: [component],\r\n    })(class DynamicModule {});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, { providers: [provideHttpClient()] });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen switching from `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` (and renaming the option `browser` to `main` in `angular.json`, the application still compiles, but breaks during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic template for testing could be `<div *ngIf=\"true\">If you see this, it's working</div>`\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNG0303: Can't bind to 'ngIf' since it isn't a known property of 'div' (used in the 'DynamicComponent' component template).\r\nIf the 'ngIf' is an Angular control flow directive, please make sure that either the 'NgIf' directive or the 'CommonModule' is a part of an @NgModule where this component is

beefed up system running Ubuntu nativly.\r\n\r\n## Procedures to replicate\r\n\r\n1. Attempted to start a new project via `ng new my-proj` (SASS, no SSR/SSG/Prerendering)\r\n2. `ng new` hangs after selecting `n` to SSR on CREATE test/public/favicon.ico (15086 bytes)\r\n3. `ctrl-c` out of `ng new` and `rm -rf my-proj`\r\n4.

Can't quit out like normal, it just hangs. I have left it running for upwards of 20 minutes, and it is still hanging. \r\n\r\nAlso, during the process of writing this, I did get it to finish a hung `ng new`, but it took over 45 minutes. It looks the same as my previous `ng new` which did not hang.\r\n\r\n## My package.json\r\n\r\nThe only difference from a new install is that I also installed angular material, but I would assume that my issue is probably related to the same one I had with my initial creation of the project, so I am posting it here and not in the angular material issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"my-proj\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"watch\": \"ng build --watch --configuration development\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^18.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^18.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.14.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^18.0.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^18.0.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~2.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.4.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attempts to remedy\r\n\r\nRemoving node_modules and reinstalling\r\nRemoving package.lock and reinstalling\r\n`npm cache clean --force`\r\n`npm cache validate`\r\nRestarting my machine\r\nRemoving angular material from the list of packages\r\nInstalling tslib myself\r\nInstalling run-applescript myself\r\nComplaining to my boss\r\nPraying\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ihormelgp/ng18-npm-i-brokey\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nnpm install --verbose always stuck on the following line\r\n\r\n...\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/eastasianwidth 4ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/fast-json-stable-stringify 4ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/bundle-name 5ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/default-browser-id 6ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/run-applescript 3ms (cache hit)\r\n⠇\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.5\r\nNode: 20.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: <error>\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   <error>\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1 (cli-only)\r\ntypescript                      <error>\r\nzone.js                         <error>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nProlly a good idea to add that feature --verbose to `ng new` so people like me can give more details, but I think what I got is still pretty decent.

But tracking budgets helps to see, how the size changes overtime.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhen I run `build`, I'd like to have cli option that would update `angular.json` file and the budgets section. It's tedious to update that file manually.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have a script for this task but it does not work with the new builder. The produced `stats.json` does not have enough information. There is no information which chunks are initial and which are loaded later. Also, I'm not sure how I could map the chunks to budgets in angular.json. Before the stats.json had the same chunkName and it could be just compared with the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nThis method was also nice, because I could print table that compared the values from angular.json and stats.json and see difference. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to expose the data that builder clearly has when it prints the output table?

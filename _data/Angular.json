While this works, it's not \"Signal-native\".\n\nAs Angular continues to embrace Signals, our application state is increasingly stored in Signals. This includes data-fetching state, which is now being standardized with the experimental httpResource API.\n\nTo use an httpResource (or any async Signal-based state) in a guard, we need a clean, idiomatic pattern. We must manually convert the resource's state (isLoading(), data(), error()) into an Observable with operators (pipe, first, map), which adds boilerplate and feels counter-intuitive.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose enhancing the Angular Router to natively understand a new return type from guard functions: a Signal (or computed) that emits a GuardResult object.\n\nThis GuardResult object would have a declarative API to manage asynchronous dependencies:\n\n```\ntype SignalGuardResult = {\n  isLoading: boolean;\n  canActivate?: boolean | UrlTree; // or canMatch, canDeactivate, etc.\n};\n```\n\nHow the router would handle this:\n\n1. If a guard function returns a Signal<SignalGuardResult>, the router subscribes to it.\n2. As long as the Signal's value is { isLoading: true }, the navigation is paused.\n3. When the Signal's value updates to { isLoading: false, ... }, the router reads the canActivate (or equivalent) property and proceeds, cancels, or redirects.\n\nThis pattern provides the perfect \"adapter\" to compose state from any Signal-based source, especially the new httpResource.\n\n**Example Implementation**\n\nThis proposal's power is best demonstrated by its synergy with httpResource.\n\n1. Service using httpResource:\n\n```\n// auth.service.ts\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { httpResource } from '@angular/http';\n\ntype UserProfile = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  isAdmin: boolean;\n};\n\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\nexport class AuthService {\n  readonly user = httpResource<UserProfile>(() => '/api/user/profile');\n}\n```\n\n2. Signal-based Guard consuming the httpResource:\n\n```\n// auth.guard.ts\nimport { inject } from '@angular/core';\nimport { computed } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Router, CanActivateFn, UrlTree } from '@angular/router';\nimport { AuthService } from './auth.service';\n\nexport const canActivateAdmin: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\n  const authService = inject(AuthService);\n  const router = inject(Router);\n  \n  const userResource = authService.user;\n\n  // The guard returns a `computed` signal.\n  // This signal transforms the resource's state into the `SignalGuardResult`\n  return computed(() => {\n    const resourceState = userResource.state();\n    \n    switch (resourceState) {\n      case 'loading':\n      case 'pending':\n        // 1. Declarative loading state: Router waits.\n        return { isLoading: true };\n\n      case 'success':\n        const user = userResource.data();\n        if (user?.isAdmin) {\n          // 2. Success and authorized: Router proceeds.\n          return { isLoading: false, canActivate: true };\n        } else {\n          // 3. Success but not authorized: Router redirects.\n          const urlTree = router.createUrlTree(['/unauthorized']);\n          return { isLoading: false, canActivate: urlTree };\n        }\n\n      case 'error':\n        // 4. Error state: Router redirects to login.\n        const urlTree = router.createUrlTree(['/login']);\n        return { isLoading: false, canActivate: urlTree };\n    }\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Synergy with Experimental APIs: Provides a first-class pattern for using httpResource and Resource state within the Router.\n- Declarative & Composable: The computed guard cleanly composes state from one or more Signals/Resources. The logic is declarative and easy to read (e.g., state === 'loading').\n- Idiomatic: Aligns perfectly with the \"Signals-first\" direction of Angular.\n- Less Boilerplate: Eliminates the need for toObservable, pipe, first, map, etc.\n- Error Handling: Provides a clear path for handling the error state of a resource, not just the success state.\n\nThis enhancement would make the Router fully compatible with the new Signal-based, resource-oriented architecture.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe main alternative is the current status quo: using toObservable(userResource) and then piping the result through RxJS operators like first(state => state !== 'loading') and map(...) to transform the state.\n\nThis works, but it's verbose, adds a dependency on RxJS just for state consumption, and feels less idiomatic in a Signal-first application. It creates significant friction when trying to use new APIs like httpResource directly with the Router, forcing a mix of reactive paradigms.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(router): Support Signal-based Guards for async composition (incl. httpResource)\" (#65130)"},{"Id":"3617944008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-12T23:01:36","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"65124","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Fixed mermaid diagram node label contrast in dark mode","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.27.0`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0270)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.26.0` or `~0.26.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n- Use `Uint8Array.fromBase64` if available ([#&#8203;4286](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4286))\n\n  With this release, esbuild's `binary` loader will now use the new [`Uint8Array.fromBase64`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/fromBase64) function unless it's unavailable in the configured target environment. If it's unavailable, esbuild's previous code for this will be used as a fallback. Note that this means you may now need to specify `target` when using this feature with Node (for example `--target=node22`) unless you're using Node v25+.\n\n- Update the Go compiler from v1.23.12 to v1.25.4 ([#&#8203;4208](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4208), [#&#8203;4311](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4311))\n\n  This raises the operating system requirements for running esbuild:\n\n  - Linux: now requires a kernel version of 3.2 or later\n  - macOS: now requires macOS 12 (Monterey) or later\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rolldown/rolldown

This ensures that, regardless of the globally installed Node.js instance, the CLI will use the compatible version of Node.js.\n\n  If the package has a `postinstall` script, that script will be executed using the specified Node.js version.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10141](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10141)\n\n- Added a new setting: `trustPolicy`.\n\n  When set to `no-downgrade`, pnpm will fail installation if a package’s trust level has decreased compared to previous releases — for example, if it was previously published by a trusted publisher but now only has provenance or no trust evidence.\n  This helps prevent installing potentially compromised versions of a package.\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8889](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8889).\n\n- Added support for `pnpm config get globalconfig` to retrieve the global config file path [#&#8203;9977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9977).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When a user runs `pnpm update` on a dependency that is not directly listed in `package.json`, none of the direct dependencies should be updated [#&#8203;10155](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10155).\n- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#&#8203;10160](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10160).\n- Setting `gitBranchLockfile` and related settings via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` should work [#&#8203;9651](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9651).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

While upgrading our large-scale application to Angular 20, we encountered some questions and limitations related to browser support that we would like to clarify and formally request enhancements for.\n\n✅ Facts\n\n- Our service officially supports Chrome ≥ 67 and iOS ≥ 14, \nand our Browserslist configuration has been aligned with these requirements.\n\n- Up through Angular 18, this setup worked without issues.\n\n- After upgrading to Angular 20, running the development server now triggers Unsupported Browsers warnings whenever our configured browsers fall below Angular’s Baseline requirement.\n\n- Reviewing Angular CLI source code indicates that Angular does not ignore our Browserslist settings. Instead, Angular compares them to the new Baseline and emits warnings when they do not meet the threshold.\n\n- We already operate a Babel + core-js polyfill pipeline, which ensures that Chrome 67 and iOS 14 work properly in our production environment.\n\n⸻\n\n？ Questions / unclear points in the documentation \n\n1. Before Angular 20, Angular followed a “latest two major versions” support model. With Angular 20 adopting the “widely available Baseline,” it is unclear whether this change:\n\t•\teffectively reduces the supported browser range, or\n\t•\tsimply standardizes the criteria without reducing actual support. The documentation does not clearly explain this transition.\n\n2. We would like to know whether Angular 20 introduces any significant ES or language-level changes that justify meaningfully raising the minimum browser requirements relative to Angular 18.\n\n3. Our application is extremely large-scale (over 1 million lines of Angular code) and must support over 99% of users, including those on older browsers.Since we already use a custom Babel + core-js polyfill pipeline, we want to know whether Angular can provide official mechanisms that:\n\t•\tallow broader or lower browser targets, and\n\t•\tsupport custom polyfill strategies for teams that require extended browser compatibility.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide an official “extended polyfill mode”\n\nThis mode could offer:\n\t•\tAutomatic polyfill determination based on Browserslist\n\t•\tNative integration of core-js within Angular’s build pipeline\n\t•\tThe ability for applications to opt in to supporting browsers below Angular’s Baseline\n\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"polyfillMode\": \"extended\"\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n-","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31751","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can Angular Provide a Way to Guarantee Support for a Broader Range of Browsers?\" (#31751)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3614932067","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-13T02:45:50","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32313","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pnpm to v10.21.0 (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/tree/HEAD/pnpm)) | [`10.20.0` -> `10.21.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pnpm/10.20.0/10.21.0) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/pnpm/10.21.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/pnpm/10.21.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/pnpm/10.20.0/10.21.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/pnpm/10.20.0/10.21.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>\n\n### [`v10.21.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.21.0): pnpm 10.21\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.20.0...v10.21.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- **Node.js Runtime Installation for Dependencies.** Added support for automatic Node.js runtime installation for dependencies. pnpm will now install the Node.js version required by a dependency if that dependency declares a Node.js runtime in the \"engines\" field. For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"engines\": {\n      \"runtime\": {\n        \"name\": \"node\",\n        \"version\": \"^24.11.0\",\n        \"onFail\": \"download\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If the package with the Node.js runtime dependency is a CLI app, pnpm will bind the CLI app to the required Node.js version. This ensures that, regardless of the globally installed Node.js instance, the CLI will use the compatible version of Node.js.\n\n  If the package has a `postinstall` script, that script will be executed using the specified Node.js version.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10141](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10141)\n\n- Added a new setting: `trustPolicy`.\n\n  When set to `no-downgrade`, pnpm will fail installation if a package’s trust level has decreased compared to previous releases — for example, if it was previously published by a trusted publisher but now only has provenance or no trust evidence.\n  This helps prevent installing potentially compromised versions of a package.\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8889](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8889).\n\n- Added support for `pnpm config get globalconfig` to retrieve the global config file path [#&#8203;9977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9977).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When a user runs `pnpm update` on a dependency that is not directly listed in `package.json`, none of the direct dependencies should be updated [#&#8203;10155](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10155).\n- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#&#8203;10160](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10160).\n- Setting `gitBranchLockfile` and related settings via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` should work [#&#8203;9651](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9651).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Click any option\n2. Press the arrow keys until you reach the disabled option\n3. Notice that you need to press the key twice to jump to the next available option\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe disabled options should not be considered by the key manager. We should have to press the arrow key just once to get to the next available enabled menu item.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nKeyboard navigation requires two key presses to move past a disabled item. The disabled item neither visibly shows focus nor stays in place with the first key press, resulting in confusing/delayed navigation.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.10\n- CDK/Material:

An injectable class can be used as a functional guard using the `inject` function: `resolve: {'user': () => inject(UserResolver).resolve()}`.\r\n\r\nIn Angular 15, there was a **deprecation of class-based Guards and Resolvers**, which has sparked discussions regarding this decision. The deprecation of these interfaces is seen as a regression that goes against established software engineering practices. Some argue that there wasn't sufficient discussion on the topic.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in various posts, including the one at https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47924#issuecomment-1542123337, the removal of these interfaces has negative implications for scalability and opens up Angular to potential misuse and bad practices. This change will likely **result in class-based approaches no longer being a first-choice option for developers** - especially for new developers.\r\n\r\nThe Angular team provided quick polyfills to ensure compatibility with older code as seen at https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47924#issuecomment-1533252207, but this doesn't fully address the primary concerns surrounding this change.\r\n\r\nTo raise awareness and gather feedback from the community, I am opening this issue in the hopes of engaging in a discussion to gain a better understanding of everyone's thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\nCC: @mgechev \r\n\r\nThank you.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50234","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecated/Removed Class-Based Guards and Resolvers\" (#50234)"},{"Id":"1704068493","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T14:34:19","Actor":"laurentgoudet","Number":"50233","RawContent":null,"Title":"Performance issue in Firefox with ng-container inside a <select>","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nplatform-browser\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a list of ~2000 entries (US Universities) in a `<select>` element, with some dynamic filtering done with an `ngIf`. In short the code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <select>\r\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let option of options\">\r\n        <option\r\n          *ngIf=\"true\"\r\n          [ngValue]=\"option.value\"\r\n        >\r\n          {{ option.displayText ?? 'Please select' }}\r\n        </option>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n    </select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works fine in Chrome, this causes Firefox to freeze. Spinning up the Firefox DevTools shows that the native DOM `Node.insertBefore` for each of the 2000 select items take almost 1s, compare to ~300ms in Chrome (x3000 faster).\r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 09 48 12\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/2169585/9e817714-25e8-481f-a9de-f47ce39e7496\">\r\n\r\nChrome:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 09 49 05\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/2169585/8cfa6a87-1889-4f90-8e54-20c2cac52a90\">\r\n\r\nPlaying around with the repro in https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-f1vhwu?file=src%2Fmain.ts shows that removing the `*ngIf` & moving the `*ngFor` to the `<option>` element (aka removing the `<ng-container>`) works around the issue, although in my case I cannot do that (e.g. pre-filter the `options` object) as I use the `*ngIf` to handle select groups/items.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this issue seems to be specific to `<ng-container>`s inside `<select>` elements, as a simple list of `<div>`s load fine in Firefox (https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-akq8zj?file=src/main.ts):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let option of options\">\r\n      <div *ngIf=\"true\">\r\n        {{ option.displayText ?? 'Please select' }}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn short, there seem to be a performance bug specific to Firefox with the way Angular handles `<ng-container>` elements within `<select>`\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-f1vhwu?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nFirefox becomes unresponsive and shows the \"This page is slowing down Firefox..\" banner\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nI'm on v14 but I've upgraded the StackBlitz to latest and it still happens\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nOur CEO happens to be using Firefox 😀","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50233","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance issue in Firefox with ng-container inside a <select>\" (#50233)"},{"Id":"1704027598","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T14:13:16","Actor":"rajeshoodles","Number":"50232","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document is not defined in universal( server side rendering)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThis issue only happens in angular universal( server-side rendering).\r\nIf a **document** is used in the project to communicate with the local storage of the browser and to perform other things.

If you remove the (click) event from the span inside the dynamic view then the `Hello` button needs to be clicked only once\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jbchr/angular-ios-click-bug\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 16.20.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\n\r\nBut this is happening also at least from Angular V12\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50230","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"iOS - Button Click is ignored when there is a dynamic view created based on a touch or mouse Event\" (#50230)"},{"Id":"1703711548","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T11:27:58","Actor":"jakovljevic-mladen","Number":"50228","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): mark `toSignal` as a \"Developer Preview\" item in the docs","State":"open","Body":"The function implementation signature needs to have JSDocs comment so that docs generator could parse it and use the data from the comment to generate valid docs content.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It looks like the docs generator only takes data from JSDocs comments from the implementation of the function, therefore I added only basic docs above the code that implements `toSignal`.\r\n\r\n~I was thinking about adding only this JSDocs comment:~\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * @developerPreview\r\n */\r\nexport function toSignal<T, U = undefined>(source: Observable<T>, options?: ToSignalOptions<U>): Signal<T|U> {\r\n  // impl...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n~But then I saw that the docs seem a bit empty, so I added heading, `@params` and `@return` docs as well.~\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThese sentences from JSDoc comments:\r\n - -\r\n   ```\r\n   `toSignal` returns a `Signal` which provides synchronous reactive access to values produced\r\n   by the given `Observable`, by subscribing to that `Observable`. The returned `Signal` will always\r\n   have the most recent value emitted by the subscription, and will throw an error if the\r\n   `Observable` errors.`\r\n   ```\r\n - \r\n   ```\r\n   By default, the subscription will be automatically cleaned up when the current injection context\r\n   is destroyed. For example, when `toObservable` is called during the construction of a component,\r\n   the subscription will be cleaned up when the component is destroyed. If an injection context is\r\n   not available, an explicit `Injector` can be passed instead.\r\n   ```\r\n - \r\n   ```\r\n   If the subscription should persist until the `Observable` itself completes, the `manualCleanup`\r\n   option can be specified instead, which disables the automatic subscription teardown. No injection\r\n   context is needed in this configuration as well.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nare moved to the function implementation signature. The reason is that all 4 overloads had the same sentence in every JSDoc comment, therefore editing one of them would require editing the same sentence in all 4 places. Now, it is only visible in one place. And, they are now part of the **Description** heading:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/28087049/1fbe317a-b778-4365-a43b-5ee486c49b0b)\r\n\r\nOverload signatures now have `@param` and `@return` docs + the [first overload](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cc286be7af31c7f999d6c469d3fd8f9becb28ce7/packages/core/rxjs-interop/src/to_signal.ts#L76) has `@developerPreview` tag.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/28087049/ebe29788-545a-43d4-aa7d-035ec4672a76)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sidenote_: I updated `manualCleanup` docs where I stated that Observables can manually terminate themselves on errors as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50228","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(core): mark `toSignal` as a \"Developer Preview\" item in the docs\" (#50228)"},{"Id":"1703341194","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-10T08:01:58","Actor":"r3dDoX","Number":"50226","RawContent":null,"Title":"Parse provided \"custom-elements-manifest\" and/or types provided in the HTMLElementTagNameMap for custom elements","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler, core\n\n### Description\n\nWe created a shared UI library with lit and are exporting plain web components to be used in any web application.

The compiler output has changed in the following ways:\r\n\r\n### Directive handler\r\nThe directive handler now extracts a reference to the input transform function and it resolves the type of its first parameter. It also asserts that the type can be referenced in the compiled output and that it doesn't clash with any pre-existing `ngAcceptInputType_` members.\r\n\r\n### .d.ts\r\nIn the generated declaration files the compiler now inserts an `ngAcceptInputType_` member for each input with a `transform` function. The member's type corresponds to the type of the first parameter of the function, e.g.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// foo.directive.ts\r\n@Directive()\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  @Input({transform: (incomingValue: string) => parseInt(incomingValue)}) value: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// foo.directive.d.ts\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  value: number;\r\n  static ngAcceptInputType_value: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type check block\r\nIf an input has `transform` function, the TCB will use the type of its first parameter for the setter type. This uses the same infrastructure as the `ngAcceptInputType_` members.\r\n\r\n### Directive declaration\r\nThe generated runtime directive declaration call now includes the `transform` function in the `inputs` map, if the input is being transformed. The function will be picked up by the runtime in the next commit to do the actual transformation.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// foo.directive.ts\r\n@Directive()\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  @Input({transform: (incomingValue: string) => parseInt(incomingValue)}) value: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// foo.directive.js\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  ɵdir = ɵɵdefineDirective({\r\n    inputs: {\r\n      value: ['value', 'value', incomingValue => parseInt(incomingValue)]\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50225","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): introduce compiler infrastructure for input transforms\" (#50225)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1706799610","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T01:50:53","Actor":"paoyuan","Number":"25195","RawContent":null,"Title":"Weird base dev-server path with esbuild ","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFollowing #25128 the base dev-server path has been set (ex. admin)\r\n1.

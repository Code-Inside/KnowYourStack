However, it's definitely not a syntax or breaking error (just extra whitespace in a div).  And the error messaging here didn't really help to detect our dev's mistake.\r\n\r\nOur expectation would be that either\r\na) if there is nothing but whitespace around the ICU, it should be trimmed, or\r\nb) that the wrapping, anonymous ICU should include the whitespace and handle wrapping the ICU quietly, or\r\nc) a descriptive error could be thrown.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pburkindine/i18n-whitespace\r\n\r\n`npm run start-es`\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nUnable to parse ICU expression in \"{VAR_SELECT, select, a {C} b {D}}\" message.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.6\r\nNode: 12.18.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.6\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.6\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39227","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"i18n throws error when ICU definitions differ only by whitespace\" (#39227)"},{"Id":"718641244","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-12T15:26:50","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"39214","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to d807b8240","State":"closed","Body":"Updating [angular#master](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master) from [cli-builds#master](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/tree/master).\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/7208ef964...d807b8240):\n\n**Modified**\n- help/new.json","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39214","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to d807b8240\" (#39214)"},{"Id":"718656142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-12T15:26:43","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"39215","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add linkable section about updating commit messages in `CONTRIBUTING.md`","State":"closed","Body":"A common review request is updating the commit message of a commit.

We want our checkbox to be checked only if certain business logic is met. To prevent the checkbox from getting checked, we call the event.preventDefault() method inside of our click handler attached to our checkbox element. Though the preventDefault() prevents the checkbox from being checked, but in IE11 it can be observed that the ngModel binding is updated, i.e binded variable has default value set to false, the value now updates to true, but the checkbox state remains unchanged. Also, this can be observed only when we click on the checkbox for the first time, after that on clicking on the checkbox the value remains unchanged if we call preventDefault() method.\r\n\r\n### üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere, is the plunker for the issue described above:\r\n\r\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/J29x5S7TTKBjoSXt\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n on looking into the source code.

I am familiar with the \"sourceMapPathOverrides\" that I discovered from https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2453.  Unfortunately, this hack can only be used with \"VSCode + Chrome + msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome extension\".  \r\n\r\nIf you are not using this environment, you are screwed.  Even if you are using that environment, you should not have to do this. \r\n The paths should be correct to begin with.  I came up with a custom workaround, but I would rather not have to mess with webpack via @angular-builders/custom-webpack.  My workaround is at bottom of this report (scroll down a little).\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. ng new my-workspace --createApplication=false\r\n2. cd my-workspace\r\n3. ng g application my-app --routing=false --style=scss\r\n4. ng serve\r\n5.

These changes update all the code so that it used the correct API (according to the CLI team). High-level overview of the changes and why they were necessary:\r\n1. Previously we parsed the `angular.json` ourselves using `JSON.parse` in order to support very old versions of the CLI, however this is no longer feasible, because the CLI has set up classes around the parsed data which are non-trivial to construct. According to the CLI, we don't have to worry about older version anymore, because the schematics infrastructure will ensure that we're running against the correct version.\r\n2. The interface of the new API is different from the one we were using before so I had to rewrite some code.\r\n3. Some of these new APIs are asynchronous so I've had to move some code around to accommodate it.\r\n4. Previously we would `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` the `angular.json` file whenever we needed to mutate it (e.g. when adding a theme), but this isn't possible anymore due to the aforementioned classes around the config file. I've reworked our schematics to use a utility from the CLI to write to the file.\r\n5. A lot of our tests depended on parsing the `angular.json`, changing a property and writing it back as JSON. This isn't possible, because the abstraction around the config can't be stringified so I've worked around it by writing out the `angular.json` file from scratch in the test. While this is more code, it should be easier to maintain in the long term.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20745","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: update to the latest Angular next versions and account for schematics breaking changes\" (#20745)"},{"Id":"719501439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:42:50","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"20770","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dev-infra-private version","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20770","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dev-infra-private version\" (#20770)"},{"Id":"719452624","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-12T15:06:05","Actor":"friedcell","Number":"20769","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow buttons with text+icon or icon+text","State":"open","Body":"Only using block on mat-icon-button means you can have buttons that are not icon only (icon+text or text+icon)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20769","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow buttons with text+icon or icon+text\" (#20769)"},{"Id":"719385902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-12T13:35:25","Actor":"BeniFreitag","Number":"20768","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(expansion-panel): Disable animation with [@.disabled]=\"true\" stopped working in Angular 10","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. create a simple mat-expansion-panel like this\r\n````html\r\n<mat-expansion-panel [@.disabled]=\"true\">\r\n````\r\n2.

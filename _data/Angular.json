It will be adjusted once the RFC is closed.**\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: this PR is based on top of PR #51162, so only the last commit (https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/83b02bb5accc7297e7a45732d2363aa5f4072a92) contains a new change.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates compiler logic to generate the `setClassMetadataAsync` calls for components that used defer blocks. The `setClassMetadataAsync` function loads deferrable dependencies and invokes the `setClassMetadata` synchronously once everything is loaded. This change is needed to avoid eager references to deferrable symbols in component metadata in generated code.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51182","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[WIP] refactor(compiler): apply component metadata asynchronously when defer blocks are present\" (#51182)"},{"Id":"1823019066","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T19:24:30","Actor":"tomer953","Number":"51181","RawContent":null,"Title":"withFetch() and router guard create random bug","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a fully functional app using Angular 16.1.4 (standalone) and Electron 25. I am using the new experimental option for the `provideHttpClient()` - `withFetch()`, and the ng-select package (latest version 11.0.0) inside my app's navbar to search for users from the API (autocomplete).\r\n\r\nToday, I added a router guard (functional guard) to my main page. The guard is something like:\r\n `return inject(AuthService).login()`, which creates an HTTP request to the backend. The guard is working as expected, and I've been using this approach for years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the combination of `withFetch()` and the `authGuard` is causing a strange bug: The ng-select component is not working properly - it doesn't show a list of items (even though the API calls appear in the network tab), the CSS is a bit off (the input is on top of the placeholder), among other strange behaviors.\r\n\r\nJust by removing either `withFetch()` or the authGuard, everything works as expected. So, it seems the combination of the two is creating side effects on the ng-select component.\r\n\r\nI updated to Angular 16.1.6, but the bug persists. I have another app that works with ng-select, Angular 16, and authGuard without any issues. I have a lot of experience with Angular, and this is a strange one. I'm not sure if anyone will know the cause, especially without a reproduction of the bug. But if no one has a clue, I'll do my best to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo errors on the console at all.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 16.1.4 \\ 6\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\n\r\nElectron: 25\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI am running angular inside electron app, but this is not releated to Electron in my opinion, since I can also run the angular app in the browser directly (localhost:4200) and I see the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n- Everything is working as expected without the guard\r\n- If the guard is not using http request (ie, just returns of(true)) - no problem\r\n- No errors in the console, the http requests for the guard and the ng-select autocomplete is working and getting valid respones (200) using fetch api","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51181","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"withFetch() and router guard create random bug\" (#51181)"},{"Id":"1822897037","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T19:12:34","Actor":"rlejeune","Number":"51180","RawContent":null,"Title":"signal - effect() not always triggered when the signal is updated","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nNot sure if this is a bug, or if I use effect() wrong.\r\n\r\n I have this effect in the constructor, I tried with patchValue too btw same result.\r\n```\r\neffect(() => {\r\n   this.organizationForm?.controls['name'].setValue(this.organization().name);\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this code which is called when the form is saved, which should trigger the effect but it does not\r\n```\r\nconst organization = await this.service.saveOrg();\r\nthis.organization.update(() => organization);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change the code in the effect for this, then it is triggered. \r\n```\r\neffect(() => {\r\n   const name = this.organization().name;\r\n   this.organizationForm?.controls['name'].setValue(name);\r\n});\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAny reason why assigning the signal value to a const first before setting the form value works, but not if used directly?\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.1.5\r\nNode: 16.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.5\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51180","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"signal - effect() not always triggered when the signal is updated\" (#51180)"},{"Id":"1822161360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T17:03:51","Actor":"sunilbaba","Number":"51173","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Adding required and Transform Args into the usage notes & Inputs and Output tutorials","State":"closed","Body":"Adding required and Transform args into the usage notes of Input decorator\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is an invalid selector, but having checked the compiled Bootstrap directly, there is no reference to this class. The base style is simply `.form-floating > label` while there are a number of styles in the format of `.form-floating > [another selector] ~ label`. \r\n\r\nBased on the double space after the `>` selector, it seems one of those intermediary selectors is being removed during CSS processing. \r\n\r\nThe minimal reproduction is based off of a fresh `ng new` project where SCSS is deleted, Bootstrap is loaded in via NPM and imported in `global.css`. No other configuration has changed or third-party code introduced. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jodylecompte/reproduction-ng-critical-css-bootstrap\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\n2 rules skipped due to selector errors:   \r\n.form-floating >  ~ label -> Did not expect successive traversals.   \r\n.form-floating >  ~ label -> Did not expect successive traversals.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.1.5\r\nNode: 18.10.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.5\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.1.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nSuspicion of this being related to critical CSS inlining is based off of the errors disappearing if `inlineCriticalCss` is disabled in the ngExpressEngine configuration.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  server.engine('html', ngExpressEngine({\r\n    bootstrap: AppServerModule,\r\n    inlineCriticalCss: false,\r\n  }));\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51176","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Invalid selector rules being skipped in production mode for Angular Universal\" (#51176)"},{"Id":"1822528439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T14:21:35","Actor":"markostanimirovic","Number":"51175","RawContent":null,"Title":"Provide the ability to remove code needed only in dev mode from the production bundle","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nSeveral NgRx libraries have features/checks that are only used in development mode (e.g. store runtime checks, component store lifecycle hooks check, store devtools, etc).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExpose the `ngDevMode`/`isNgDevMode` variable to the public API, so it can be used in Angular libraries that have dev mode-related functionalities, but also in user codebases if needed.\r\n\r\nThis feature could significantly reduce the size of production bundles in many Angular codebases.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently, we can use `ngDevMode` to remove dev mode-related logic from the production bundle in the following way:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare const ngDevMode: boolean;\r\nconst isNgDevMode = typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || !!ngDevMode;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nif (isNgDevMode) {\r\n  console.warn('@ngrx/store: ...');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this global variable is not part of the public API and it can be risky to rely on it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51175","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide the ability to remove code needed only in dev mode from the production bundle\" (#51175)"},{"Id":"1822302973","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T12:38:09","Actor":"magioloro","Number":"51174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Effects don't work after updating from @angular/cli 14.2.11 to 14.2.12","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nHi at all,\r\n\r\nafter upgrading to angular/cli 14.2.12 all my NgRx effects using fetch() are broken: \r\n\r\nExample code: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndownloadInvoice$ = createEffect(() =>\r\n        this.actions$.pipe(\r\n            ofType(TasksActions.downloadInvoice),\r\n            fetch({\r\n                run: (action: ReturnType<typeof TasksActions.downloadInvoice>) =>\r\n                    TaskUtil.loadInvoicePdf(action.orderId, this.taskService).pipe(\r\n                        map(() => TasksActions.downloadInvoiceSuccess())\r\n                    ),\r\n                onError: (action: ReturnType<typeof TasksActions.downloadInvoice>, error: any) =>\r\n                    TasksActions.downloadInvoiceError({ error })\r\n\r\n            })\r\n        )\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen reverting to 14.2.11 everything runs like clockwork again.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: src/app/portal/tasks/+state/tasks.effects.ts:199:13 -

This also includes whitespaces and comment nodes that Angular produces during the rendering on the server. Those whitespaces and nodes must be present in the HTML generated by the server-side rendering process. This is also documented at: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#constraints.\r\n\r\nIn practice, some CDNs ([example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/auto-minify/)) have mechanisms to remove all comment nodes and spaces from all text nodes from HTML while serving the content (there are also cases where this type of optimization is performed at the build step). Those mechanisms are frequently enabled by default. This leads to situations where an application worked in dev mode correctly, but started failing in production. Since the production code is also minified, it makes it hard to look at the stack trace and identify the origin of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis feature requests proposes that we add a special detection mechanism for such cases. For example, we can do the following:\r\n\r\n- on the server, while serializing DOM, add a comment node to a well known location (e.g. as a first node in the `<body>`)\r\n- on the client (both in dev and prod modes), before starting hydration process, verify the presence of those \"marker\" nodes and throw an error if they are not present\r\n- we should also add an error guide for this error, so that the link to the guide is present in production mode\r\n\r\nOne of the examples where this issue becomes a hard-to-debug problem: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50133#issuecomment-1535713053","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51160","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hydration: detect when index.html is altered between the server and the client\" (#51160)"},{"Id":"1819024480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-24T19:41:43","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"51158","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Provide a diagnostic for negated `AsyncPipe` in ngIf expressions","State":"open","Body":"Negating an `AsyncPipe` in an `*ngIf` thrashes the layout because the pipe emits null immediately before checking the condition.

CSS nesting allows selectors to be used where declarations are expected. There's an IE7 hack where prefixing a declaration with a `*` causes that declaration to only be applied in IE7 due to a bug in IE7's CSS parser. However, it's valid for nested CSS selectors to start with `*`. So esbuild was incorrectly parsing these declarations and anything following it up until the next `{` as a selector for a nested CSS rule. This release changes esbuild's parser to terminate the parsing of selectors for nested CSS rules when a `;` is encountered to fix this edge case:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%; height: 1px; {\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that the syntax for CSS nesting is [about to change again](https://togithub.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7961), so esbuild's CSS parser may still not be completely accurate with how browsers do and/or will interpret CSS nesting syntax. Expect additional updates to esbuild's CSS parser in the future to deal with upcoming CSS specification changes.\n\n-   Adjust esbuild's warning about undefined imports for TypeScript `import` equals declarations ([#&#8203;3271](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3271))\n\n    In JavaScript, accessing a missing property on an import namespace object is supposed to result in a value of `undefined` at run-time instead of an error at compile-time. This is something that esbuild warns you about by default because doing this can indicate a bug with your code. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    console.log(styles.buton)\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    // styles.js\n    export let button = {}\n    ```\n\n    If you bundle `app.js` with esbuild you will get this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Import \"buton\" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in \"styles.js\" [import-is-undefined]\n\n            app.js:2:19:\n              2 │ console.log(styles.buton)\n                │                    ~~~~~\n                ╵                    button\n\n          Did you mean to import \"button\" instead?\n\n            styles.js:1:11:\n              1 │ export let button = {}\n                ╵            ~~~~~~\n\n    However, there is TypeScript-only syntax for `import` equals declarations that can represent either a type import (which esbuild should ignore) or a value import (which esbuild should respect). Since esbuild doesn't have a type system, it tries to only respect `import` equals declarations that are actually used as values. Previously esbuild always generated this warning for unused imports referenced within `import` equals declarations even when the reference could be a type instead of a value. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only warn in this case if the import is actually used. Here is an example of some code that no longer causes an incorrect warning:\n\n    ```ts\n    // app.ts\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    import ButtonType = styles.Button\n    ```\n\n    ```ts\n    // styles.ts\n    export interface Button {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.63`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n### [`v23.0.62`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n### [`v23.0.61`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n### [`v23.0.60`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The problem with the previous approach is that it assumes that a `link` tag processed by Critters will be preceded by a `style` tag that was inserted by Critters. This assumption might not necessarily be true if Critters is unable to resolve the content of the linked styles. Furthermore, I'm not sure if we need to optimize this code path to begin with, because it only does a shallow traversal of the `head` tag which is generally fast and is unlikely to have many direct descendants.\r\n\r\nFixes #25419.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25584","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): error during critical CSS inlining for external stylesheets\" (#25584)"},{"Id":"1818488234","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-26T07:19:36","Actor":"majoer","Number":"25575","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: \"link.prev?.setAttribute is not a function\" - CSP and <link rel=\"stylesheet\">","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nng build breaks when we combine ngCspNonce with a hard-coded style-sheet link in index.html.\r\n\r\nWe can replicate this in a new angular app. However, this problem first appeared for us in an Angular Universal app, with the following setup:\r\n- We add ngCspNonce to the app-root as explained in: https://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy\r\n- We also add some external style-sheets as links in index.html.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is where the bug occurs\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/index-file/inline-critical-css.ts#L149\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1.

This causes ES Modules in the output with non-configurable methods/properties. As a result, we cannot mock JS modules.

[`v0.18.16`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01816)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.15...v0.18.16)\n\n-   Fix a regression with whitespace inside `:is()` ([#&#8203;3265](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3265))\n\n    The change to parse the contents of `:is()` in version 0.18.14 introduced a regression that incorrectly flagged the contents as a syntax error if the contents started with a whitespace token (for example `div:is( .foo ) {}`). This regression has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.18.15`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01815)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.14...v0.18.15)\n\n-   Add the `--serve-fallback=` option ([#&#8203;2904](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2904))\n\n    The web server built into esbuild serves the latest in-memory results of the configured build. If the requested path doesn't match any in-memory build result, esbuild also provides the `--servedir=` option to tell esbuild to serve the requested path from that directory instead. And if the requested path doesn't match either of those things, esbuild will either automatically generate a directory listing (for directories) or return a 404 error.\n\n    Starting with this release, that last step can now be replaced with telling esbuild to serve a specific HTML file using the `--serve-fallback=` option. This can be used to provide a \"not found\" page for missing URLs. It can also be used to implement a [single-page app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that mutates the current URL and therefore requires the single app entry point to be served when the page is loaded regardless of whatever the current URL is.\n\n-   Use the `tsconfig` field in `package.json` during `extends` resolution ([#&#8203;3247](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3247))\n\n    This release adds a feature from [TypeScript 3.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages) where if a `tsconfig.json` file specifies a package name in the `extends` field and that package's `package.json` file has a `tsconfig` field, the contents of that field are used in the search for the base `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n-   Implement CSS nesting without `:is()` when possible ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Previously esbuild would always produce a warning when transforming nested CSS for a browser that doesn't support the `:is()` pseudo-class. This was because the nesting transform needs to generate an `:is()` in some complex cases which means the transformed CSS would then not work in that browser. However, the CSS nesting transform can often be done without generating an `:is()`. So with this release, esbuild will no longer warn when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()` in the cases where an `:is()` isn't needed to represent the nested CSS.\n\n    In addition, esbuild's nested CSS transform has been updated to avoid generating an `:is()` in cases where an `:is()` is preferable but there's a longer alternative that is also equivalent. This update means esbuild can now generate a combinatorial explosion of CSS for complex CSS nesting syntax when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()`. This combinatorial explosion is necessary to accurately represent the original semantics. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .first,\n    .second,\n    .third {\n      & > & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    :is(.first, .second, .third) > :is(.first, .second, .third) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .first > .first,\n    .first > .second,\n    .first > .third,\n    .second > .first,\n    .second > .second,\n    .second > .third,\n    .third > .first,\n    .third > .second,\n    .third > .third {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This change means you can now use CSS nesting with esbuild when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`. You'll now only get a warning from esbuild if you use complex CSS nesting syntax that esbuild can't represent in that older browser without using `:is()`. There are two such cases:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    a b {\n      .foo & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a {\n      > b& {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    These two cases still need to use `:is()`, both for different reasons, and cannot be used when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    .foo :is(a b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a > a:is(b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically lower `inset` in CSS for older browsers\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically expand the `inset` property to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties when esbuild's `target` is set to a browser that doesn't support `inset`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 10px;\n      right: 20px;\n      bottom: 10px;\n      left: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add support for the new [`@starting-style`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/#defining-before-change-style-the-starting-style-rule) CSS rule ([#&#8203;3249](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3249))\n\n    This at rule allow authors to start CSS transitions on first style update. That is, you can now make the transition take effect when the `display` property changes from `none` to `block`.\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;starting-style {\n      h1 {\n        background-color: transparent;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Output */\n    @&#8203;starting-style{h1{background-color:transparent}}\n    ```\n\n    This was contributed by

https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.3.0...3.3.1\n\nThis release fixes a regression for cases where the `ignore` option is used with a string ([#&#8203;403](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/403), [#&#8203;404](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/404)).\n\nThe public interface of this package does not support a string as the value for the [`ignore` option](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#ignore) since 2018 year ([release](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/2.0.0)).\n\nSo, in the next major release, we will reintroduce method implementations that do not involve strings in the `ignore` option.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n###

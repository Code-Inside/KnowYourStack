It only supports CommonJS. \r\n\r\nSo if we have an Electron-based application that uses Angular, it appears we are stuck on an old version of Angular. Our app currently uses ng 10, so I know that works.  But our attempts to upgrade to 13 have failed.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide both mjs and cjs assets in the npm packages i.e. support both ESM and CommonJS.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI'd love to know of a way to make Angular 13 (even 15) work in Electron, but I haven't found it yet.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51853","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular should provide support for both ESM and CommonJS\" (#51853)"},{"Id":"1907681082","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T20:06:39","Actor":"SebastianPodgajny","Number":"51852","RawContent":null,"Title":"@Input('class.name') binding doesn't work","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nAngular compiler doesn't generate input binding instruction for `<my-cmp [class.xyz]=\"true\"/>`\r\n\r\nCompilation result\r\n```\r\nɵɵclassProp('xyz', true);\r\n```\r\nexpected result\r\n```\r\nɵɵclassProp('xyz', true);\r\nɵɵproperty('class.xyz', true);\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5nar3p?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51852","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@Input('class.name') binding doesn't work\" (#51852)"},{"Id":"1907312317","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T17:23:18","Actor":"panda-byte","Number":"51849","RawContent":null,"Title":"RouterOutlet does not clear DOM immediately","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBasically same issue as #17499 from 2017, which was closed due to a lack of a minimal reproduction of the bug.\r\n\r\nWhen navigating using the router, the router outlet content in the DOM is not immediately cleared. Even though the previously displayed component's `ngOnDestroy` was already called, the DOM is still intact in the `ngAfterViewInit` hook of the newly displayed component, which was very surprising to me. However, after a short delay (1 ms `setTimeout`) the DOM is cleared. Is this the expected behavior? It affects the computed bounding box of `ViewChild` elements evaluated in `ngAfterViewInit`. This caused some issues for me, because I wanted to use a canvas element for a library and dynamically change its size based on its initial position upon initialization (make it fill the remaining screen space taking layout elements outside of the router outlet into account).\r\n\r\nThe minimal reproduction uses two components, `TestComponent` ('/test') and `HomeComponent` ('/home'), where the user can switch between the two by using a button which calls the router. When loading '/test' initially, the router outlet is empty (as seen by the output of the document body's `innerHTML`), and the computed bounding box of the `ViewChild` button element is as expected. But when loading `HomeComponent` first and then switching to `TestComponent`, the router outlet still contains the content of `HomeComponent` when `ngAfterViewInit` of `TestComponent` is called. The output of the innerHTML during `ngAfterViewInit` and after a 1 ms delay as well as the top coordinate of the button's bounding rect is displayed on the page.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-k7fvz1?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftest.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAs seen by the output on the page, the DOM is not cleared from previous content when entering the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle hook of the newly loaded component, and the bounding boxes of `ViewChild` elements are affected.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout            15.0.0-beta.42\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.11\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51849","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"RouterOutlet does not clear DOM immediately\" (#51849)"},{"Id":"1907419613","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T17:13:42","Actor":"textbook","Number":"51851","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix link to refer to RxJS pipes","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

These warnings are based on existing warning in the NgOptimizedImage directive, but apply to all images, as opposed to just those generated with NgOptimizedImage. The rationale for this is that both of the image performance issues captured by these warnings apply equally to images that don't use the optimized image directive. By surfacing them as warnings, we can help improve Angular loading performance and Core Web Vitals. \r\n\r\nThe two warnings are: \r\n1) Lazy-loaded-LCP: Fires when the the scanner discovers that an image which is the LCP element has been rendered with `loading=\"lazy'`. This can have a strong negative impact on LCP.\r\n2) Oversized image: Fires when the scanner detects an image where the intrinsic height or width are more than 1200 pixels larger than the rendered height or width.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the scanner runs once, on the page `load` event.\r\n\r\nCC: @AndrewKushnir @kara @dgp1130 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51846","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): add warnings for oversized images and lazy-lcp\" (#51846)"},{"Id":"1906256652","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T07:02:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"51845","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): narrow the types of built in coercion functions","State":"open","Body":"Narrows the types of `booleanAttribute` and `numberAttribute` to the ones that they're able to reliably coerce.

The changes here will be the base for implementing the `on viewport` and `on hover` triggers as well. Includes the following commits:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): extract deferred block trigger information\r\nReworks the compiler to use the API introduced in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51816 to match triggers to the element nodes they point to. This will be used to generate the new instructions for `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement final instruction generation for interaction triggers\r\nUpdates the logic that generates the instructions for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers to their final shape. Now the instructions take two arguments:\r\n1. `triggerIndex` - index at which to find the trigger in the view where it will be rendered.\r\n2. `walkUpTimes` - tells the runtime how many views up it needs to go to find the trigger element. If the argument is omitted, it means that the trigger is in the same view as the deferred block. A positive number means that the runtime needs to go up X amount of times to find the trigger. A negative number means that the trigger is inside the root view of the placeholder block. Negative numbers are capped at -1 since the placeholder is always in the same position at runtime.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add event manager for deferred blocks\r\nAdds an environment-level injectable that keeps track of the events related to `defer` blocks. Currently it only manages the events for `interaction` triggers, but we'll use it for `viewport` and `hover` as well.\r\n\r\n### feat(core): implement deferred block interaction triggers\r\nAdds the implementation for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51830","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Implement deferred interaction triggers\" (#51830)"},{"Id":"1903565298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-19T18:59:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"51827","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose the ViewTransition object created during Router navigation","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nrouter\n\n### Description\n\nEnabling view transitions in the Router using `withViewTransitions` allows developers to easily opt in to animating navigations between pages in the application. Under the hood, the Router calls `document.startViewTransition` but does not make the `ViewTransition` object that is returned from the function available in the public API. This means that skipping a transition with [skipTransition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/skipTransition) or applying and removing styles when the transition is [finished](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition/finished) is not possible/difficult.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExpose the `ViewTransition` in some way in the public API. This may not need to be the `ViewTransition` object itself. For example, the different states of the view transition in the react [useViewTransitions](https://github.com/noamr/use-view-transitions/blob/main/src/react-vt.ts#L113) are exposed through `transitionState` and managed internally. To keep things similarly a bit more locked down/hidden, the transition state could be exposed as a `signal` in Angular.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- use timeouts to guess when the transition is finished / update callback is done\r\n- skip transitions by applying CSS class to the HTML which disable the animation and then removing the class before the next transition\r\n- attempt to call `startViewTransition` at the right time without turning on the Router feature","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose the ViewTransition object created during Router navigation\" (#51827)"},{"Id":"1903469549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-19T17:51:14","Actor":"atscott","Number":"51826","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): Remove deprecated setupTestingRouter function","State":"open","Body":"The `setupTestingRouter` function is a factory function for creating a new instance of the `Router`.

The initial implementation is still experimental and lacks a lot of features, but it is sufficient to run tests generated by `ng new`.\r\n\r\nThere's no docs or setup instructions yet, however the main path to trying this out is to replace `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` with `@angular-devkit/build-angular:web-test-runner` in `angular.json`. Since Web Test Runner is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Karma, options should mostly align. Currently only a couple options are actually supported right now, but more will be added over time.\r\n\r\nThe commit messages go more in detail on the implementation. In particular, Web Test Runner integration is done via a custom HTML page which explicitly loads the user's JavaScript in a very particular order. This allows our custom Jasmine integration, sets up Zone.js to patch those symbols correctly, configures `TestBed`, and then runs the user's tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently some unrelated unit tests appear to be failing due to Web Test Runner pulling in `@types/mocha` which is conflicting with `@types/jasmine`. I'm looking into the proper fix for that.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25860","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial Web Test Runner Implementation\" (#25860)"},{"Id":"1899073535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T21:02:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25859","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based application build system through either the `application` or `browser-esbuild` builder, the `localize` option will now allow inlining project defined localizations. The process to configure and enable the i18n system is the same as with the Webpack-based `browser` builder. The implementation uses a similar approach to the `browser` builder in which the application is built once and then post-processed for each active locale. In addition to inlining translations, the locale identifier is injected and the locale specific data is added to the applications. Currently, this implementation adds all the locale specific data to each application during the initial building. While this may cause a small increase in the polyfills bundle (locale data is very small in size), it has a benefit of faster builds and a significantly less complicated build process. Additional size optimizations to the data itself are also being considered to even further reduce impact. Also, with the eventual shift towards the standard `Intl` web APIs, the need for the locale data will become obsolete in addition to the build time code necessary to add it to the application.\r\nWhile build capabilities are functional, there are several areas which have not yet been fully implemented but will be in future changes. These include console progress information, efficient watch support, and app-shell/service worker support.\r\nSSR, pre-rending and app-shell support will be added in followup PRs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25859","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support i18n inlining with esbuild-based builder\" (#25859)"},{"Id":"1898864251","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-15T20:12:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25858","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis is to align with the `serviceWorker` option.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25858","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): accept boolean and string in `ssr` option\" (#25858)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1907872649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T22:44:29","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"27826","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 slider support","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27826","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 slider support\" (#27826)"},{"Id":"1907833811","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T22:11:06","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"27825","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/card): remove legacy theme normalization","State":"open","Body":"This is no longer needed now that everything is using the new theme inspection APIs","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27825","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/card): remove legacy theme normalization\" (#27825)"},{"Id":"1907825810","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T22:01:28","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"27824","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 snackbar support","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27824","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 snackbar support\" (#27824)"},{"Id":"1903657092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T16:25:58","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"27812","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 toolbar support","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27812","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): add M3 toolbar support\" (#27812)"},{"Id":"1903322251","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-21T15:45:49","Actor":"mukul-kmr-jha","Number":"27811","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-calendar): Mat-Calendar Custom Header should not change the activedate","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n\r\nI'm using Angular's `mat-calendar` component as an inline component and I'm currently working on customizing the UI and handling the month change event.

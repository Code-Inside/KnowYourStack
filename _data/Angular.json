I also extensively use lazy modules (not router ones - loaded manually with `loadChildren`).\r\n\r\nThe compilation has the same output (files out, ~their size), but in total it is about 20-30% slower than earlier; I checked it a couple of times, also go back in the history before change and to the current state; it was reproductive.

change is scoped only to the plugin\n`zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\nchecked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner ._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\nits behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\npreviously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\ncallback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\nthe task is explicitly cancelled, e.g with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\n#### [0.11.5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.4...zone.js-0.11.5) (2022-03-03)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** async-test should only call done once ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([dea7234](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dea7234a76f652c8e9d9b79719e2b170a5a50777))\n-   **zone.js:** defineProperties should also set symbol props ([#&#8203;45098](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45098)) ([b437d12](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b437d1238d9006baa0cf749adbd7cc3270de3040)), closes [#&#8203;44095](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44095)\n-   **zone.js:** fix several test cases which trigger `done()` multiple times ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([d5565cc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d5565ccdb4573a47eb329b09c6852c1ae39672a6))\n-   **zone.js:** only one listener should also re-throw an error correctly ([#&#8203;41868](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41868)) ([299f92c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/299f92c3b62a43c94cff4a204f9e41c46a159efc)), closes [#&#8203;41867](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41867) [/github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562#issuecomment-822696973](https://togithub.com//github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562/issues/issuecomment-822696973)\n-   **zone.js:** patch global instead of Mocha object ([#&#8203;45047](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45047)) ([8efbdb5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8efbdb57c11a6c632f69d7e142a632b6a853fa46)), closes [#&#8203;42834](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/42834)\n-   **zone.js:** should continue to executue listeners when throw error ([#&#8203;41562](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41562)) ([008eaf3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/008eaf3b7df90b2cdd9c83e229d23d4014d6dbc9)), closes [#&#8203;41522](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41522)\n-   **zone.js:** update several flaky cases ([#&#8203;41526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41526)) ([25a83eb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/25a83eb264aa19fc4616cea45e04d790b9bcd777)), closes [#&#8203;41434](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41434)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **zone.js:** add Promise.any() implementation ([#&#8203;45064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45064)) ([4d494d2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4d494d24ccb69b40a477b0bccd97baf6af66accf)), closes [#&#8203;44393](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44393)\n-   **zone.js:** update electron patch to support electron/remote 14 ([#&#8203;45073](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45073)) ([d65706a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d65706a3b225ccb88d719478c19a379aef1b6047)), closes [#&#8203;43346](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/43346)\n\n#### [0.11.4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.3...zone.js-0.11.4) (2021-02-10)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** fesm2015 bundle should also be strict module.

This behavior used to hide real errors,\nso the logic is now updated to trigger original errors (if any). One exception\nwhere the patch remains in place is `document.registerElement`\n(to allow smooth transition for code/polyfills that rely on old behavior in legacy browsers).\nIf your code relies on the old behavior (where errors were not thrown before),\nyou may need to update the logic to handle the errors that are no longer masked by ZoneJS patch.\n\n#### [0.11.1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.0...zone.js-0.11.1) (2020-08-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** zone.js package.json should not include files/directories field ([#&#8203;38528](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38528)) ([6b662d1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6b662d1)), closes [#&#8203;38526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38526) [#&#8203;38516](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38516) [#&#8203;38513](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38513)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This allows the bundler to locate and process any resource files such as images or fonts used within the stylesheet.\r\nThe implementation of the rebasing functionality uses a series of custom Sass importers to transform the input stylesheets (from import or use rules) when they are loaded from the file system. However, for the Sass compiler to use the load functionality of an importer, the `canonicalize` function (used to resolve an import) of the same importer must return a resolved path to the requested stylesheet. To support this requirement, all stylesheet resolution has been implemented in three new importers: relative, module, and load path. An additional benefit of these resolvers is that they have been implemented to minimize the volume of filesystem calls and also cache directory entry information (currently per request) to further reduce file system access. The reduction in filesystem calls provides a small performance benefit for projects containing a large amount of Sass file imports.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24185","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): rebase Sass url() values when using esbuild-based builder\" (#24185)"},{"Id":"1437931698","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-07T13:13:00","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24190","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The problem is that the naming is also used in the class names generated by `typography-hierarchy`. These changes aim to avoid breakages by:\r\n1. Introducing a `legacy-typography-hierarchy` mixin that keeps the old behavior.\r\n2. Migrating users to the legacy mixin in `ng update`.\r\n3. Migrating users to the new version in `ng generate`. \r\n4. Renaming all usages of the legacy classes in templates and Sass files to the new ones.\r\n\r\nIn the process of writing the migration for the legacy typography, I found an issue where as a side-effect of PostCSS's behavior to re-run processors whenever an AST is mutated, we were applying the same migrations multiple times. This hadn't shown up until now, because all the migrations are independent, but in the `typography-hierarchy` we have a case where some legacy and non-legacy classes are being swapped. This led to wrong output and was causing the integration tests to time out. I've resolved the issue by:\r\n1. Wrapping these conflicting classes in a special value so that they aren't migrated incorrectly on the first pass. The special value is removed at the end of the migration.\r\n2. Adding some code in the `StyleMigrator` to avoid processing the same AST node with the same migration more than once.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've also included a couple of additional commits to fix the typography demo in the dev app and to reorganize a few schematic tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25929","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle typography hierarchy in MDC migration\" (#25929)"},{"Id":"1434749549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-06T10:26:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25921","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): clean up map-get usages","State":"closed","Body":"The global `map-get` function is deprecated.

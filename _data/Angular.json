I believe the difference between those two are pretty minor, I'm writing my code in such a way that my pipe always outputs BehaviorSubjects.\r\n\r\nI still want to keep that approach cause its async what I do and I benefit from the pipeline operators from RxJS. However I do see the potential long term which Signals will bring to the table.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is have beside the model signal also the observable version or better said the BehaviorSubject version cause that one is the closest to the signal. This would have the benefit then that we could still code RxJS inside the ts file while it would still be possible to use the new API.\r\n\r\nImagine we have the following function which adds to our signal the BehaviorSubject reference (almost same as toObservable function):\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ICustomSignal<T> extends ModelSignal<T>\r\n{\r\n    obs$: BehaviorSubject<T>;\r\n}\r\nexport function toCustomSignal<T>(source: ModelSignal<T>, options?: ToObservableOptions): ICustomSignal<T> {\r\n    !options?.injector && assertInInjectionContext(toCustomSignal);\r\n    const injector = options?.injector ?? inject(Injector);\r\n    let castedSource = source as ICustomSignal<T>\r\n\r\n    if(castedSource.obs$)\r\n        return castedSource;\r\n    \r\n    const subject = new BehaviorSubject<T>(source());\r\n    castedSource.obs$ = subject;\r\n    \r\n    let subscription = subject.subscribe(x => {\r\n        if (source() == x)\r\n            return;\r\n        source.set(x);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    const watcher = effect(\r\n        () => {\r\n            let value: T;\r\n            try {\r\n                value = source();\r\n            } catch (err) {\r\n                untracked(() => subject.error(err));\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n            untracked(() => subject.next(value));\r\n        },\r\n        { injector, manualCleanup: true },\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    injector.get(DestroyRef).onDestroy(() => {\r\n        subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n        watcher.destroy();\r\n        subject.complete();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return castedSource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inside the component:\r\n```ts\r\nsomeInput = model<string>('LOADING');\r\nsomeInputExtended = toCustomSignal(this.someInput);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI wonder if you would support such things, cause personally I don't see myself going away from RxJS. Or are the people using RxJS will never truly be first-class citizens in Angular?\r\n\r\nBesides, I would personally be more happy if you would not force me to write 2 lines of code, right now this is not possible:\r\n```ts\r\nsomeInput= toCustomSignal(model<string>('LOADING'));\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/35216938/6e035097-2877-40f7-a581-0f51a5b6ab22\">\r\n\r\nMaybe we could have simply a flag which enables this functionality, or the RxJS part provides a signal which is also having the BehaviorSubject part.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56809","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"A signal with BehaviorSubject prop is possible\" (#56809)"},{"Id":"2385637347","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T08:47:03","Actor":"bdorresteijn-visma","Number":"56805","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mark FormControlDirective as standalone","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nIt would be nice, if possible, to mark the FormControlDirective as a standalone component.

Description\r\n\r\nWhile I was working with the new inputs & outputs, I have encountered a small inconsistency when defining input and Host Attribute Token.\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\n`label = inject(new HostAttributeToken('label'));`\r\n`options = input<any[]>();`\r\n\r\nHostAttributeToken is kind OOP way and the input is more functional way.\r\n\r\nWhy not make it consistent and use functional way for both input and HostAttributeToken?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nGiven the function declaration for the inject and HostAttributeToken, I have come up with this solution.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function hostAttributeToken(attributeName: string, optional?: boolean): string | null {\r\n  if (optional === true) {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName), { optional }) as string | null;\r\n  }\r\n  else if (optional === false) {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName), { optional }) as string;\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName)) as string;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing it will be more natural in my opinion.\r\n`label = hostAttributeToken('label');`\r\n\r\nThis is the type definition.\r\n```\r\n**\r\n * @param token A token that represents a static attribute on the host node that should be injected.\r\n * @returns

This would also reduce the need for \"file watch filtering\".\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAccording to inotify man page angular watcher could use folder watches instead of watching file reducing the amount of watcher greatly (reusing a single inotify watcher per watched folder instead of one watcher file actual file).\r\n\r\nThe code would have to do the actual filtering on event reception to known if the item was watched (the event includes a file `name` attribute for folder watch allowing to known which file changed).\r\n\r\n```\r\nNAME         [top](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html#top_of_page)\r\n       inotify - monitoring filesystem events\r\nDESCRIPTION         [top](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html#top_of_page)\r\n       The inotify API provides a mechanism for monitoring filesystem\r\n       events.  Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to\r\n       monitor directories.  When a directory is monitored, inotify will\r\n       return events for the directory itself, and for files inside the\r\n       directory.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nThe name field is present only when an event is returned for a\r\n       file inside a watched directory; it identifies the filename\r\n       within the watched directory.  This filename is null-terminated,\r\n       and may include further null bytes ('\\0') to align subsequent\r\n       reads to a suitable address boundary.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe suggested alternative on the internet is to increase the sysctl limit for watchers at the cost of a kernel memory usage increase.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27982","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Reduce angular uses of file watcher by leveraging folder watcher (ex: ng serve)\" (#27982)"},{"Id":"2386323980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T14:13:04","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27980","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update @discovery/json-ext to v0.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27980","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update @discovery/json-ext to v0.6.0\" (#27980)"},{"Id":"2386331706","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T14:04:52","Actor":"bryanerayner","Number":"27981","RawContent":null,"Title":"rspack support would be revolutionary","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nAs of now, our build process for multiple Angular apps takes more than 12 minutes for each of our 20 apps we maintain for our enterprise product.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Revert the recent change to avoid bundling dependencies for node ([#&#8203;3819](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3819))\n\n    This release reverts the recent change in version 0.22.0 that made `--packages=external` the default behavior with `--platform=node`.  The default is now back to `--packages=bundle`.\n\n    I've just been made aware that Amazon doesn't pin their dependencies in their \"AWS CDK\" product, which means that whenever esbuild publishes a new release, many people (potentially everyone?) using their SDK around the world instantly starts using it without Amazon checking that it works first. This change in version 0.22.0 happened to break their SDK. I'm amazed that things haven't broken before this point. This revert attempts to avoid these problems for Amazon's customers. Hopefully Amazon will pin their dependencies in the future.\n\n    In addition, this is probably a sign that esbuild is used widely enough that it now needs to switch to a more complicated release model. I may have esbuild use a beta channel model for further development.\n\n-   Fix preserving collapsed JSX whitespace ([#&#8203;3818](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3818))\n\n    When transformed, certain whitespace inside JSX elements is ignored completely if it collapses to an empty string. However, the whitespace should only be ignored if the JSX is being transformed, not if it's being preserved. This release fixes a bug where esbuild was previously incorrectly ignoring collapsed whitespace with `--jsx=preserve`. Here is an example:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>\n\n    // Old output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo><Bar /></Foo>;\n\n    // New output (with --jsx=preserve)\n    <Foo>\n      <Bar />\n    </Foo>;\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The behavior follows the WebAssembly/ES module integration proposal. The usage of this feature requires the ability to use native async/await and top-level await. Due to this requirement, applications must be zoneless to use this new feature. Applications that use Zone.js are currently incompatible and an error will be generated if the feature is used in a Zone.js application. Manual setup of a WASM file is, however, possible in a Zone.js application if WASM usage is required. Further details for manual setup can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Loading_and_running\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief example of using a WASM file in the new feature with the integration proposal behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport { multiply } from './example.wasm';\r\n\r\nconsole.log(multiply(4, 5));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: TypeScript will not automatically understand the types for WASM files. Type definition files will need to be created for each WASM file to allow for an error-free build. These type definition files are specific to each individual WASM file and will either need to be manually created or provided by library authors.\r\n\r\nThe feature relies on an active proposal which may change as it progresses through the standardization process. This may result in behavioral differences between versions.\r\nProposal Details: https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/tree/main/proposals/esm-integration\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding zoneless applications, you can visit https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27973","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): support WASM/ES Module integration proposal\" (#27973)"},{"Id":"2383756526","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-01T22:21:22","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"27970","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: re-enable localize warning check","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] Other...

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Omit packages from bundles by default when targeting node ([#&#8203;1874](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1874), [#&#8203;2830](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2830), [#&#8203;2846](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2846), [#&#8203;2915](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2915), [#&#8203;3145](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3145), [#&#8203;3294](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3294), [#&#8203;3323](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3323), [#&#8203;3582](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3582), [#&#8203;3809](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3809), [#&#8203;3815](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3815))\n\n    This breaking change is an experiment. People are commonly confused when using esbuild to bundle code for node (i.e. for `--platform=node`) because some packages may not be intended for bundlers, and may use node-specific features that don't work with a bundler. Even though esbuild's \"getting started\" instructions say to use `--packages=external` to work around this problem, many people don't read the documentation and don't do this, and are then confused when it doesn't work. So arguably this is a bad default behavior for esbuild to have if people keep tripping over this.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now omit packages from the bundle by default when the platform is `node` (i.e. the previous behavior of `--packages=external` is now the default in this case). *Note that your dependencies must now be present on the file system when your bundle is run.* If you don't want this behavior, you can do `--packages=bundle` to allow packages to be included in the bundle (i.e. the previous default behavior). Note that `--packages=bundle` doesn't mean all packages are bundled, just that packages are allowed to be bundled. You can still exclude individual packages from the bundle using `--external:` even when `--packages=bundle` is present.\n\n    The `--packages=` setting considers all import paths that \"look like\" package imports in the original source code to be package imports. Specifically import paths that don't start with a path segment of `/` or `.` or `..` are considered to be package imports. The only two exceptions to this rule are [subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) (which start with a `#` character) and TypeScript path remappings via `paths` and/or `baseUrl` in `tsconfig.json` (which are applied first).\n\n-   Drop support for older platforms ([#&#8203;3802](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3802))\n\n    This release drops support for the following operating systems:\n\n    -   Windows 7\n    -   Windows 8\n    -   Windows Server 2008\n    -   Windows Server 2012\n\n    This is because the Go programming language dropped support for these operating system versions in [Go 1.21](https://go.dev/doc/go1.21#windows), and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.20 to Go 1.22.\n\n    Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the `esbuild` npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.21). That might look something like this:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\n        cd esbuild\n        go build ./cmd/esbuild\n        ./esbuild.exe --version\n\n    In addition, this release increases the minimum required node version for esbuild's JavaScript API from node 12 to node 18. Node 18 is the oldest version of node that is still being supported (see node's [release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) for more information). This increase is because of an incompatibility between the JavaScript that the Go compiler generates for the `esbuild-wasm` package and versions of node before node 17.4 (specifically the `crypto.getRandomValues` function).\n\n-   Update `await using` behavior to match TypeScript\n\n    TypeScript 5.5 subtly changes the way `await using` behaves. This release updates esbuild to match these changes in TypeScript. You can read more about these changes in [microsoft/TypeScript#58624](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58624).\n\n-   Allow `es2024` as a target environment\n\n    The ECMAScript 2024 specification was just approved, so it has been added to esbuild as a possible compilation target. You can read more about the features that it adds here: <https://2ality.com/2024/06/ecmascript-2024.html>. The only addition that's relevant for esbuild is the regular expression `/v` flag. With `--target=es2024`, regular expressions that use the `/v` flag will now be passed through untransformed instead of being transformed into a call to `new RegExp`.\n\n-   Publish binaries for OpenBSD on 64-bit ARM ([#&#8203;3665](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3665), [#&#8203;3674](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3674))\n\n    With this release, you should now be able to install the `esbuild` npm package in OpenBSD on 64-bit ARM, such as on an Apple device with an M1 chip.\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;ikmckenz](https://togithub.com/ikmckenz).\n\n-   Publish binaries for WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) preview 1 ([#&#8203;3300](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3300), [#&#8203;3779](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3779))\n\n    The upcoming WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) standard is going to be a way to run WebAssembly outside of a JavaScript host environment. In this scenario you only need a `.wasm` file without any supporting JavaScript code. Instead of JavaScript providing the APIs for the host environment, the WASI standard specifies a \"system interface\" that WebAssembly code can access directly (e.g. for file system access).\n\n    Development versions of the WASI specification are being released using preview numbers. The people behind WASI are currently working on preview 2 but the Go compiler has [released support for preview 1](https://go.dev/blog/wasi), which from what I understand is now considered an unsupported legacy release. However, some people have requested that esbuild publish binary executables that support WASI preview 1 so they can experiment with them.\n\n    This release publishes esbuild precompiled for WASI preview 1 to the `@esbuild/wasi-preview1` package on npm (specifically the file `@esbuild/wasi-preview1/esbuild.wasm`). This binary executable has not been tested and won't be officially supported, as it's for an old preview release of a specification that has since moved in another direction. If it works for you, great! If not, then you'll likely have to wait for the ecosystem to evolve before using esbuild with WASI. For example, it sounds like perhaps WASI preview 1 doesn't include support for opening network sockets so esbuild's local development server is unlikely to work with WASI preview 1.\n\n-   Warn about `onResolve` plugins not setting a path ([#&#8203;3790](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3790))\n\n    Plugins that return values from `onResolve` without resolving the path (i.e. without setting either `path` or `external: true`) will now cause a warning. This is because esbuild only uses return values from `onResolve` if it successfully resolves the path, and it's not good for invalid input to be silently ignored.\n\n-   Add a new Go API for running the CLI with plugins ([#&#8203;3539](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3539))\n\n    With esbuild's Go API, you can now call `cli.RunWithPlugins(args, plugins)` to pass an array of esbuild plugins to be used during the build process. This allows you to create a CLI that behaves similarly to esbuild's CLI but with additional Go plugins enabled.\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;edewit](https://togithub.com/edewit).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>istanbuljs/istanbuljs (istanbul-lib-instrument)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.3`](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/HEAD/packages/istanbul-lib-instrument/CHANGELOG.md#603-2024-06-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/compare/istanbul-lib-instrument-v6.0.2...istanbul-lib-instrument-v6.0.3)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   allow use of importAttributes Babel parser plugin ([#&#8203;786](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/issues/786)) ([a44a124](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/commit/a44a124a600a798165f157d643f1fdb095c74f95))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.39`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#8439)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.38...8.4.39)\n\n-   Fixed `CssSyntaxError` types (by [@&#8203;romainmenke](https://togithub.com/romainmenke)).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

To enable the optimization, script optimization must be enabled as well as an environment variable `NG_BUILD_OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS=1`. This build step uses `rollup` internally to process the build files directly in memory. The main bundling performs all resolution, bundling, and tree-shaking of the application. The chunk optimizer step then only needs to access the in-memory built files and does not need to perform any disk access or module resolution. This allows the step to be performed fairly quickly but it does add time to the overall production build. The `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF=1` environment variable can be used to view how long the step takes within a build via the `OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS` entry. In the future, this optimization step may be automatically enabled based on initial file entry count and size. There are several current known issues:\r\n1) Bundle budgets for named lazy chunks may not work as expected.\r\n2) The console output may not show names (files will be present) for lazy chunk files.\r\n3) The stats file (`--stats-json` option) will not exactly reflect the final written application files.

in my application. With a fresh Angular 18 setup, this works perfectly fine, even with AOT, but when switching to the webpack builder (which we unfortunately need for unrelated reasons), I'm getting trouble with not being able to use any imported modules (including, e.g., CommonModule).\r\n\r\nWithout AOT, everything works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/aueelis/dynamic-template-issue\r\n\r\nIn `main.ts`, I fetch the `dynamic-template.html`, which is then used to create a simple `DynamicComponent`. This is then declared in a `DynamicModule`, which is also importing the `CommonModule` to support `*ngIf`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <ng-template #dynamicContainer></ng-template>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  name = 'Angular';\r\n\r\n  @ViewChild('dynamicContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true })\r\n  dynamicContainer: ViewContainerRef = {} as ViewContainerRef;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\r\n    this.httpClient\r\n      .get('dynamic-template.html', { responseType: 'text' })\r\n      .subscribe((template) => this.useTemplate(template));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private useTemplate(template: string): void {\r\n    const { component, moduleRef } = this.createDynamic(template);\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.clear();\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.createComponent(component, {\r\n      environmentInjector: moduleRef.injector,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createDynamic(template: string): {\r\n    component: any;\r\n    moduleRef: NgModuleRef<any>;\r\n  } {\r\n    const component = this.createComponent(template);\r\n    const module = this.createModule(component);\r\n    const moduleRef = createNgModule(module, this.dynamicContainer.injector);\r\n\r\n    return { component, moduleRef };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createComponent(template: string) {\r\n    return Component({\r\n      template,\r\n    })(class DynamicComponent {});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createModule(component: any) {\r\n    return NgModule({\r\n      imports: [CommonModule],\r\n      declarations: [component],\r\n    })(class DynamicModule {});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, { providers: [provideHttpClient()] });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen switching from `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` (and renaming the option `browser` to `main` in `angular.json`, the application still compiles, but breaks during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic template for testing could be `<div *ngIf=\"true\">If you see this, it's working</div>`\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNG0303: Can't bind to 'ngIf' since it isn't a known property of 'div' (used in the 'DynamicComponent' component

The current recommended way of theming components requires writing a dedicated file with at least three mixins: `theme`, `color`, and `typography` (and `density`?). While this approach follows a good philosophy of separating concerns, it has some significant drawbacks:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Exponential Growth and Difficult Maintenance\r\n\r\nIn large projects with hundreds of components, having a separate theme for each component can become boilerplate-heavy and lead to tedious maintenance. For example, the [material.angular.io app theme](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io/blob/main/src/_app-theme.scss) imports and uses all themes scattered across the app. Scaling this approach to a much larger project would be painful and error-prone. The component-attached stylesheet is no longer the single source of truth.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Excessive Boilerplate\r\n\r\nCreating a new component requires writing a dedicated theme that we have to import and use in `styles.scss`. This adds unnecessary complexity to the development process.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Lack of Component View Encapsulation\r\n\r\nOne of Angular's cool features is view encapsulation, which prevents style collisions. However, since themes need to be applied in the main `styles.scss` file, encapsulation cannot be used. This forces us to rely on verbose CSS class names (e.g., `app-my-component-header-title`), whereas a simpler `header-title` would suffice when wrapped in an encapsulated stylesheet.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Dependence on SASS\r\n\r\nTo customize Angular Material, you have to use SASS, but some developers might prefer not to rely on it for various reasons. Additionally, `ng new` offers different stylesheet formats, which means forcing SASS can be limiting.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Alternative\r\n\r\nInspired by the new Material 3 `use-system-variables` capability, I propose using a set of CSS variables (e.g., `--sys-primary`, `--sys-body-large`, etc.) available globally for Angular Material and custom components, instead of relying on SASS mixins. Of course, we could consider having a schematics to help developer to generate those variables just like `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` does.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto listed those variables in [this comment](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29104#issuecomment-2126365863)\r\n\r\nAlso, using css variables only instead of SASS theme simplify overrides and remove the need of Angular components mixins (like `mat.button-theme($my-theme)`).\r\n\r\nHowever, I can understand we still need to import core styles. This could be easily addressed by registering the right css file in `angular.json` file in build `styles` option list.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n  \"src/styles.css\",\r\n  \"path/to/angular-material-component-core.css\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problems to Consider\r\n\r\n#### 1. Conditional Logic Based on Theme Type (Dark or Light)\r\n\r\nWe have to find a css alernative to `get-theme-type($theme)`.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\ncolor: if(mat.get-theme-type($theme) == dark, white, black);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNative CSS does not provide an `if` conditional operator, but the CSS `container` property could be a viable alternative (cf. https://stackoverflow.com/a/76327443).\r\n\r\n#### 2. Reading Palettes' Hues\r\n\r\nWithout SASS, palettes will not be available. However, this issue could be mitigated by adding more CSS variables (e.g., `--sys-primary-80`, `--sys-secondary-20`).\r\n\r\n### To sumarize\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to streamline the theming process in Angular Material by reducing boilerplate, enhancing maintainability, and leveraging modern CSS capabilities. It aligns with the broader trend of using CSS variables for theming and can simplify the theming experience for developers.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature request. I believe it can significantly improve the development workflow and theming consistency in Angular Material projects.\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe could replace the following code :\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// styles.scss\r\n\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n\r\n$my-theme: mat.define-theme((\r\n color: (\r\n    theme-type: light,\r\n    primary: mat.$violet-palette,\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// carousel.scss\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: 50%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel-button {\r\n    // Read the 50 hue from the primary color palette.\r\n    color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 50);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel {\r\n    // Get the large headline font from the theme.\r\n    font: mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-large, font);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin theme($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, color) {\r\n    @include color($theme);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, typography) {\r\n    @include typography($theme);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nby this lighter code in pure css : \r\n\r\n```css\r\n// styles.css\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  --sys-primary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-secondary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-tertiary: #xxxxxx;\r\n  --sys-error: #xxxxxx;\r\n  // and so on...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// carousel.css\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  font: var(--sys-headline-large);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: 50%;\r\n  color: var(--sys-primary-50);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// no more need for _carousel-theme.scss\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29363","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theming): Replace SASS-Based theming with global CSS variables \" (#29363)"},{"Id":"2384828859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-01T22:22:16","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"29361","RawContent":null,"Title":"POC: zoneless support via await until condition in harnesses","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29361","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"POC: zoneless support via await until condition in harnesses\" (#29361)"},{"Id":"2384470455","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-01T18:23:41","Actor":"clamli","Number":"29359","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatChipGrid): Focus order is not logical","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nMultiple labels are added in a custom grid.

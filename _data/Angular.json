While this approach offers flexibility, it also introduces repetitive work in cases where a component always requires deferred loading or hydration. By defining this configuration directly at the component level, we can make templates cleaner, streamline the component setup, and reduce repetitive declarations.\n\n**Problem**: For components that are consistently loaded or hydrated in a deferred manner, wrapping every instance in an @defer block becomes an additional task that could be avoided with a component-level setting. Such repetitive @defer blocks add to template complexity and can lead to more verbose code, particularly when applied to multiple components.\n\n**Proposed Solution**: Introduce a component-level configuration option for deferred loading and hydration within the component. This approach would allow developers to specify that a component should always be deferred, without needing to wrap each instance in @defer in the template.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Cleaner Templates**: Templates become easier to read and maintain as @defer blocks are no longer needed in the template for components that consistently require deferred loading.\n- **Reduced Redundancy**: Developers can specify deferred loading once at the component level instead of adding repetitive configuration in every usage.\n- **Improved Developer Experience**: Simplifies the setup process for deferred components, making the feature more approachable and less error-prone.\n\n**Conclusion**: A component-level deferred loading configuration would enhance Angular’s usability by reducing template complexity and making the deferred loading feature more streamlined. This aligns with Angular’s philosophy of reducing configuration burden in templates, leading to more maintainable and developer-friendly code.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI'm not certain what the best solution might be, but one possible approach that comes to mind is adding a defer configuration option directly to the component decorator.\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-lazy-component',\n  templateUrl: './lazy-component.component.html',\n  defer: {},  // Component-level setting for deferred loading/hydration\n})\nexport class LazyComponent { }\n```\n\nI understand that the Angular team is focused on reducing configuration within the component decorator. An alternative approach might be a `defer` function that accepts a configuration object as input, similar to functions like `afterNextRender` or `effect`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe currently supported `defer` block","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58643","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: Component-Level Deferred Loading/Hydration Configuration in Angular\" (#58643)"},{"Id":"2656784598","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-13T21:03:56","Actor":"szeinedd-nrel","Number":"58642","RawContent":null,"Title":"@ViewChildren undefined when used in an attribute directive","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nUsing `@ViewChildren` in an attribute directive to query for child components of an element using said directive results in the `@ViewChildren` property remaining undefined.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-4cfd6x?file=src%2Fsubject.directive.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe bug does not directly cause an error.

(Listing the contents of the _browser_ folder will list the application files.)\n\nOutput from `ng version`:\n\n```\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28852","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"3rdpartylicenses.txt is being created in the wrong folder\" (#28852)"},{"Id":"2655212516","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-13T11:42:10","Actor":"johannesnormannjensen","Number":"28851","RawContent":null,"Title":"esbuild: Wrong WARNING line numbers in output","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWrong WARNING / ERROR line numbers in output\n\nExample component: \n```\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst vlue = { hue: 0, saturation: 0, lightness: 0 };\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [RouterOutlet],\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrl: './app.component.scss'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'angapp';\n\n  field = !!(vlue.hue) ?? false;\n}\n\n```\n\nTerminal output: \n\n```\n> angapp@0.0.0 build\n> ng build\n\n\nDURATION[NG_READ_CONFIG]: 0.006434709s\nDURATION[NG_READ_CONFIG]: 0.006614965s\nDURATION[NG_CREATE_PROGRAM]: 0.405366621s\nDURATION[NG_ANALYZE_PROGRAM]: 0.026746010s\nDURATION[NG_FIND_AFFECTED]: 0.000203829s\nDURATION[NG_EMIT_TS]: 0.037194445s\nDURATION[NG_DIAGNOSTICS_TOTAL]: 0.031198823s\nDURATION[NG_EMIT_JS*]: 15.239371536s [count: 700; avg: 0.021770531s; min: 0.000534034s; max: 0.040325990s]\nDURATION[NG_EMIT_JS*]: 15.239371536s [count: 700; avg: 0.021770531s; min: 0.000534034s; max: 0.040325990s]\nDURATION[OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS]: 0.284208465s\nBrowser bundles        \nInitial chunk files     | Names               |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nmain-P3YWHZB2.js        | main                | 219.42 kB |                59.51 kB\npolyfills-FFHMD2TL.js   | polyfills           |  34.52 kB |                11.28 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css     | styles              |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                        | Initial total       | 253.94 kB |                70.79 kB\n\n\nServer bundles         \nInitial chunk files     | Names               |  Raw size\nserver.mjs              | server              |   1.11 MB |                        \nchunk-WHPWUB66.mjs      | -                   | 528.79 kB |                        \npolyfills.server.mjs    | polyfills.server    | 268.60 kB |                        \nchunk-TFNYX4J6.mjs      | -                   |  19.21 kB |                        \nchunk-5XUXGTUW.mjs      | -                   |   2.55 kB |                        \nrender-utils.server.mjs | render-utils.server |   1.46 kB |                        \nmain.server.mjs         | main.server         | 149 bytes |                        \n\nLazy chunk files        | Names               |  Raw size\nchunk-VCVCHJZV.mjs      | xhr2                |  12.07 kB |                        \n\nPrerendered 1 static route.\nApplication bundle generation complete.

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.27.1 - 08 Nov 2024\n\n-   The CodeQL Action now downloads bundles compressed using Zstandard on GitHub Enterprise Server when using Linux or macOS runners. This speeds up the installation of the CodeQL tools. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users.

The esbuild configuration pre-configured the builder with the angular-devkit/build-angular:application option. If I run ng serve with this configuration the microfrontend works, but unfortunately I would need the browser-esbuild option and this is where the problem arises.\nSo by configuring angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild and changing the key from options.browser to options.main and then starting ng serve I get the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n\nChanging again from options.main to options.browser (not noticing that it warns you by saying: the browser property is not allowed.) and running ng serve again gives me:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nAnother test I performed is deleting the options.main/options.browser key and running ng serve again gives me the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nEven initializing the microfrontend with --type remote gives the same problem\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nreproducing this error is simple: \n- make a new app\n- install @angular-architects/native-federation library (my version is 18.2.2)\n- initialize the microfrontend with ng g @angular-architects/native-federation:init --type host\n- change in angular.json file architect.esbuild.builder: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\n- change from options.browser to options.main\n- ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 22.0.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use angular native federation with builder configuration: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\" (#28837)"},{"Id":"2648281070","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T06:11:57","Actor":"SanderElias","Number":"28834","RawContent":null,"Title":"`ng update` breaks on \"private\" packages","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Description\n\nI'm unsure if this is a regression.

option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating **@angular** to v19, I’ve encountered a ton SCSS compiler deprecation warnings across many of my Angular projects. This issue occurs because the “_sass_” dependency in **@angular/build/package.json** was updated from “_1.77.6_” to “_1.80.6_”. As a temporary workaround, I reverted this dependency to “_1.77.6_” in the project’s node_modules directory, although this is - quite obvious - not ideal.\n\nIdeally, we should remove deprecated SCSS code in our scss files and 3rd party dependencies (this is where it becomes a nightmare). However, as a temporary solution to silence these deprecation warnings and be relieved when running “_ng s_“, it would be helpful to pass a “**stylePreprocessorOptions**” (already exists) flag via “_angular.json_“ into the Sass compiler.\n\nPlease note that in Nuxt/Vite and Ember, disabling these deprecation warnings is already possible, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67812380/disable-dart-sass-warnings-produced-by-external-theme-file) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78997907/the-legacy-js-api-is-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-dart-sass-2-0-0).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdditional option in “angular.json\". (Should default to false.)\n\n```\n\"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n  \"silenceDeprecations\": true\n},\n```\n\nThis should result in passing the flag \"--quiet-deps\" to the sass compiler. How to silence this warnings internally can be learned here: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#silencing-deprecations-in-dependencies\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDowngrade sass dep to “1.77.6“.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add style preprocessor option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19\" (#28829)"},{"Id":"2645257155","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T07:19:46","Actor":"zrsio4","Number":"28826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 18 build --watch does not remove previous files when output hashing is used","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nI realize the title is almost word for word the same as #5846, but since that is 7 years old and for version 4, I figure creating a new case is ok.

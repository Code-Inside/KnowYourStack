If you use the async pipe on the observable (`{{ observableData | async }}`) instead of using the signal, it works without any additional error handling. After converting to a signal, you are forced to pipe to an additional catchError that converts the error into a value. I've provided a minimum example below that illustrates the problem:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { NgModule, Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { toSignal } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';\r\nimport { Observable, catchError, throwError, of } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  template: `<div>{{ property }} | {{ signalData() }}</div>\r\n    <app-child [property]=\"property\"></app-child>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  property = 'No Errors';\r\n\r\n  observableData = new Observable<string>((observer) => {\r\n    observer.next('value 1');\r\n    setTimeout(() => observer.next('value 2'), 500);\r\n    setTimeout(() => observer.next('value 3'), 1000);\r\n    setTimeout(() => observer.error(new Error('error')), 1500);\r\n  }).pipe(\r\n    catchError((error) => {\r\n      console.info('setting property...');\r\n      this.property = 'Error Caught';\r\n      return throwError(() => error);\r\n    }),\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  signalData = toSignal(this.observableData);\r\n\r\n  // Uncomment the below and comment the above to see a working solution\r\n  // Ideally, this wouldn't be necessary\r\n\r\n  // signalData = toSignal(\r\n  //   this.observableData.pipe(catchError(() => of('error'))),\r\n  // );\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-child',\r\n  template: `<div>{{ property }}</div>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class ChildComponent {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  property!: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ChildComponent],\r\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\r\n  providers: [],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the attached link to a code sandbox to view the bug in your browser.\r\n\r\nA little bit more info: On errors, we dynamically create a component that shows the error message. While the component was created and visible in the dom with the correct template structure, all the component properties embedded in the template only showed their default values, even though we could see the data in the constructor when debugging. After looking around, we noticed that the OnInit lifecycle hook never ran, which we relied on to set our data. When we moved the data into the constructor and forced a change detection cycle manually, it started showing the data in the template, as desired. Triggering a change detection cycle manually did not trigger the OnInit lifecycle hook, but it did make our properties visible in the component.\r\n\r\nMy guess? When a signal throws an error, any changes that haven't been processed yet before the signal errored aren't ever processed. This fits with what we were seeing in our own project. While it is simple enough to handle errors, it would be nice if it didn't break change detection if we forget to handle them.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-16-change-detection-signals-bug-3tcgcc?file=%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts%3A1%2C1\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo error/exception\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.4\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.4\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.4\r\n@angular/material               16.2.6\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n![Using signalData without the additional catchError](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/41601975/fc3bef94-8e75-44c6-aaf0-8bbbae8245b9)\r\n![Using signalData with the additional catchError](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/41601975/796d0779-4372-43f3-8984-4dac8177ef99)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51949","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`toSignal` breaks Change Detection on Errors\" (#51949)"},{"Id":"1918401673","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T23:39:54","Actor":"Gkleinereva","Number":"51948","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add warning for localhost proxy","State":"open","Body":"Our team ran into the problem documented in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50121.

Confusingly (to many), the `<p>After</p>` does not render either. This is because Angular's template compiler doesn't wrap component instances in a `try/catch`, which leads to the error propagating upward and breaking any UI rendering past the thrown `constructor` error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n# The proposed solution\r\n\r\nTo solve for this issue, I'd like to propose (**and offer to implement**) the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@try {\r\n\t<error-throwing-component/>\r\n} @catch (e: any) {\r\n\t<handle-error [error]=\"e\"/>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would allow us to catch any `constructor` errors while allowing the rest of the components to be rendered as-expected. I would reasonably expect this to be compiled to some pseudo-code akin to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet attemptedRender = null;\r\ntry {\r\n\tattemtedRender = renderComponent(ErrorThrowingComponent)\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n\tcleanup(attemptedRender)\r\n\trender(HandleErrorComponent, {inputs: {error: e}})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n# Userland solutions\r\n\r\nWhile `<component/>` wouldn't be able to recover from the error in runtime, it's possible to wrap this component in a `try/catch` block by moving it to a `ViewContainerRef` `createComponent` call:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'error-catcher',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [NgIf],\r\n  template: `\r\n  <div *ngIf=\"error\">\r\n    <h1>There was an error</h1>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <ng-template #compTemp></ng-template>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nclass ErrorCatcher implements OnInit {\r\n  @ViewChild('compTemp') compTemp!: TemplateRef<any>;\r\n  @Input({ required: true }) comp!: any;\r\n\r\n  containerRef = inject(ViewContainerRef);\r\n\r\n  error: any = null;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    try {\r\n      this.containerRef.createComponent(this.comp);\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      this.error = e;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [ErrorCatcher],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>Before</p>\r\n    <error-catcher [comp]=\"comp\"/>\r\n    <p>After</p>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nclass AppComponent {\r\n  comp = ErrorComponent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can even expand this functionality to accept inputs and handle outputs mostly as expected:\r\n\r\n[Demo StackBlitz showing a user-land fix to the error boundary problem](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-error-boundary-userland-poc?embed=1&file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\n[Alternative demo using a structural directive instead](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-error-boundary-userland-poc-warktp?file=src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Fon-error.directive.ts)\r\n\r\nHowever, this comes with substancial issues:\r\n\r\n- The syntax and tooling are not consistent with other Angular components\r\n- Outputs and inputs are very loose typings now, which may lead to _more_ bugs, not less\r\n- Outputs are not bound in the same way, requiring weird `switch/case` style coding and manually typing\r\n\r\n# Prior art\r\n\r\nThis idea was directly inspired by [React's `ErrorBoundary` system](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary), which similarly handles errors thrown during the render function.\r\n\r\n> Note that neither this proposal, nor React's `ErrorBoundary` handle errors that occur in event handlers, only the runtime.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\r\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.\r\n    return { hasError: true };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\r\n    // Example \"componentStack\":\r\n    //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)\r\n    //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)\r\n    //   in div (created by App)\r\n    //   in App\r\n    logErrorToMyService(error, info.componentStack);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\r\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\r\n      return this.props.fallback;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this.props.children;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went

By using `data` and `resolve`, we do not have to add anything more to the router navigation pipeline to support this feature.\r\n\r\nCloses #44928\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I somehow fill the map (in the reproduction, with `mutate` in the component constructor).\r\n\r\nWhen I iterate over it in the template using `*ngFor=\"let id of map().keys()\"`, I get NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError. That alone is unexpected to me, I'm not doing any of the things that the documentation says may cause that error.\r\n\r\nIn trying to get rid of that error, I created `keys = computed(() => map().keys())`\r\nIterating over _that_ with `*ngFor=\"let id of keys()\"` gives... nothing. The Iterator is always \"empty\". This seems like a clear bug to me.\r\n\r\nI found I could circumvent both problems with `keys2 = computed(() => [...map().keys())]` and `*ngFor=\"let id of keys2()`. I assume however that this comes with a performance penalty. In the actual application I'm building, performance will likely be an issue, so I'd prefer not to have to rely on that workaround.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nNiki Herl\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to

The could be done by some kind of hook, like the `install` script that gets executed for all dependencies that have it when you `npm install` your application.\r\n\r\nThis should support updating Angular to an older version (`ng update @angular/cli@15 @angular/core@15`), as it would update `ng-bootstrap` to v14 instead of v15 and execute required code migrations for this version.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25920","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable a way to update packages that depend on Angular when `ng update` is ran\" (#25920)"},{"Id":"1918039375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T18:14:00","Actor":"johncrim","Number":"25919","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support multi-project workspaces with jest and karma tests","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nToday one can run `ng test` to run tests across all projects with a configured `test` builder, or `ng test <project>` to run tests in a single project. However if the monorepo contains projects with both jest and karma tests it gets pretty clunky to run both. \r\n\r\nAs Angular moves toward multiple test builders there should be support for running all tests globally for select types of tests.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally `ng test` would run all tests across all projects using all configured test builders, and it would be possible to configure multiple test builders for a single project. And then it would be possible to only run tests for a single test builder using a property, like `ng test --runner=karma`, where the runner value is defined by the builder.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe following can be added to angular.json for each project:\r\n```json\r\n\"projects\": {\r\n    \"mylib\": {\r\n      \"projectType\": \"library\",\r\n      \"root\": \"projects/mylib\",\r\n      \"sourceRoot\": \"projects/mylib/src\",\r\n      \"prefix\": \"lib\",\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n...\r\n        },\r\n        \"test-karma\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"projects/mylib/tsconfig.karma-spec.json\",\r\n            \"polyfills\": [\r\n              \"zone.js\",\r\n              \"zone.js/testing\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"include\": [\r\n              \"**/*.karma-spec.ts\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"codeCoverageExclude\": [\r\n              \"**/*.jest-spec.ts\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"test-jest\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:jest\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.jest-spec.json\",\r\n            \"polyfills\": [\r\n              \"zone.js\",\r\n              \"zone.js/testing\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"include\": [\r\n              \"**/*.jest-spec.ts\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch a configuration supports 2 test builders for the project, so `ng mylib:test-karma` and `ng mylib:test-jest` works, but I can no longer `ng test` to run all tests in the workspace. Of course I could avoid leave one of the builder using `test` in all my projects, but it is still a limitation. \r\n\r\nThe current lines in my package.json would have to be updated for each new project. The following is required for only 2 projects, and it would get unwieldy for 15-20 projects:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test:karma\": \"ng run mylib:test-karma --watch false && ng run myapp:test-karma --watch false\",\r\n    \"test:jest\": \"NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 ng run mylib:test-jest && NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 ng run myapp:test-jest\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis project (checkout the `dev/jest` branch) provides an example:\r\nhttps://github.com/johncrim/ng16-yarn-pnp/tree/dev/jest\r\n\r\n(Note also that running `yarn test:jest` runs all the jest tests 2x, presumably because the `tsconfig.jest-spec.json` references test files from multiple projects. Obviously this can be fixed with tsconfig files in each project)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25919","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support multi-project workspaces with jest and karma tests\" (#25919)"},{"Id":"1916712730","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T15:33:00","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25914","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.21.9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.21.8` -> `v2.21.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.21.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.21.8...v2.21.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.21.8...v2.21.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

configurations may need to be adjusted to prevent infinite\n    redirects where additional redirects were previously ignored after an\n    absolute redirect occurred.\n-   The `setupTestingRouter` function has been removed. Use\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` or `provideRouter` to setup the `Router` for\n    tests instead.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### animations\n\n-   The `AnimationDriver.NOOP` symbol is deprecated, use `NoopAnimationDriver` instead.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

At the same time, you realize it can use Angular 16's new self-closing tags:\r\n\r\n`<some-component (onClick)=\"doSomething($event)\" />`\r\n\r\nYou save this.  The compiler will still error out, stating now that:\r\n\r\n> X [ERROR] NG9: Property 'doThis' does not exist on type 'SomeCompnent'. [plugin angular-compiler]\r\n\r\nNowhere in the code does it now reference the \"doThis\" mistake.  Everything is saved.\r\n\r\nBut it won't compile anymore.  It requires stopping the \"`ng serve`\" and re-running it.  Then it works fine.\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n> X [ERROR] NG9: Property 'doThis' does not exist on type 'SomeCompnent'.

Lately, I've encountered an issue where the Nx Console doesn't function as expected. Simultaneously, I've been experiencing a slow initiation of the terminal in VSCode, accompanied by the error message 'Resolving shell environment fails.'\r\n\r\nThis situation prompted me to investigate the possibility of a problem with the environment variables in my .zshrc configuration file. Upon reviewing my user configuration, I suspect that a particular command in my bash file may be causing these issues. I can't recall when I added that command, but I noticed a significant improvement after either removing or commenting out that particular line.\r\n\r\nI've come across a related issue on GitHub at https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25608. Unfortunately, the discussion there seems a bit confusing, and I'm unable to add any comments.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I've created a new issue to address this problem and offer a solution. This way, we can help others who might be facing the same issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nOpen a new Window on MacOs and this will continue for about 2 minutes. <img width=\"585\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/43192276/0171138b-110e-423a-b994-91c9e8e691c3\">\r\nHere is the related bash config \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n...\r\n# Load Angular CLI autocompletion.\r\nsource <(ng completion script)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nOS:MacOS Ventura 13.5.2 (Macbook Air Apple M1)\r\nThe result after running `ng version`:\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.4\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: undefined\r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1602.4 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         16.2.4 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   16.2.4 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cli                 16.2.4 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          16.2.4 (cli-only)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25910","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MacOS ZSH terminal stuck due to ng completion script\" (#25910)"},{"Id":"1915334649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-27T12:08:42","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25908","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25908","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies\" (#25908)"},{"Id":"1915317339","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-27T11:24:01","Actor":"twilker","Number":"25907","RawContent":null,"Title":"Debugging Angular library not possible in application through `npm link`","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a standard Angular 16 library and application in two different workspaces / repositories.

It seems when importing modules in the module declaration it does import the modules declarations. For example when I import the browser module it does not import NgIf, NgFor etc etc and when I import NgSelect it does not import any of its Schema or components. I am building the app without using angular-cli as I am currently migrating an app from angularjs to angular and moving it to use angular-cli would be an issue.\r\n\r\nI have set up the webpack config like\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst path = require('path'),\r\nAngularWebpackPlugin = require('@ngtools/webpack'),\r\nwebpack = require('webpack'),\r\nHtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'),\r\nWebpackDevServer = require('webpack-dev-server');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    entry: {\r\n        'test': { import: \"./app/app.module.ts\", filename: 'js/[name].bundle.min.js' },\r\n    },\r\n    mode: 'none',\r\n    output: {\r\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, \"dist\"),\r\n        clean: true\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: {\r\n        //extensions: ['.ts', '...'],\r\n        extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js', '.mjs', '.json']\r\n    },\r\n    optimization: {\r\n    },\r\n    plugins: [\r\n        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\r\n            moment: 'moment'\r\n        }),\r\n        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n            title: 'Test',\r\n            template: './app/index.hbs',\r\n            cache: false,\r\n            hash: true,\r\n            inject: false\r\n        }),\r\n        new AngularWebpackPlugin.AngularWebpackPlugin({\r\n            'tsconfig': 'tsconfig.json',\r\n            //\"compilerOptions\": {},\r\n            \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n            'jitMode': true\r\n        })\r\n    ],\r\n    module: {\r\n        rules: \r\n            [\r\n                { \r\n                    test: /\\.hbs$/i, \r\n                    use: \"handlebars-loader\",\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/, \r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\r\n                    loader: '@ngtools/webpack',\r\n                     include: /app[\\\\/]/,\r\n                    exclude: [ /node_modules/ ]                \r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[cm]?js$/,\r\n                    use: {\r\n                      loader: 'babel-loader',\r\n                      options: {\r\n                        cacheDirectory: true,\r\n                        compact: false,\r\n                        plugins: ['@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel'],\r\n                      },\r\n                      \r\n                    },\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.template\\.html$/,\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n                    use: \r\n                        [\r\n                            {\r\n                                loader: 'raw-loader',\r\n                                options: \r\n                                {\r\n                                    esModule: false,\r\n                                },\r\n                            }\r\n                        ],   \r\n                }, \r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.css$/i,\r\n                    exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n                    use: \r\n                        [  \r\n                            {\r\n                                loader: 'css-loader',\r\n                                options: {\r\n                                    import: false,\r\n                                    url: false,\r\n                                    modules: false\r\n                                }\r\n                            }    \r\n                        ]\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n        },\r\n        devServer: {\r\n            static: {\r\n              directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\r\n              watch: true\r\n            },\r\n            host: \"localhost\",\r\n            compress: true,\r\n            port: 5000,\r\n            server: 'https',\r\n            open: true,\r\n            liveReload: false,\r\n            hot: true,\r\n            client: {\r\n                overlay: true,\r\n                progress: true,\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the angular test app is\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\nimport 'zone.js';\r\n\r\nimport { NgSelectModule } from '@ng-select/ng-select';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    declarations: [\r\n        AppComponent\r\n    ],\r\n    imports: [\r\n        BrowserModule,\r\n        NgSelectModule,\r\n    ],\r\n    providers: [\r\n    ],\r\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)  \r\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));

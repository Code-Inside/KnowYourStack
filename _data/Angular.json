When used in the Input of a custom Component, CHangeDetectorRef resolves to that component instead of the hosts template.\r\n```html\r\n<hwe-rte-viewer [value]=\"description$ | async\"\r\n  [disabled]=\"(generalDisabled$ | async) || !([hasPermission$, 'WRITE'] | fnCall | async)\"\r\n  (onStartEditing)=\"onStartEditing($event)\"\r\n  (update)=\"onEditDescription($event)\"\r\n  editButtonTooltip=\"{{'PROPERTIES.GENERAL.DESCRIPTION_EDIT' | translate}}\">\r\n</hwe-rte-viewer>\r\n```\r\nThe FnCallPipe gets the folowing ChangeDetectorRef:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1051009/93484920-c8a92300-f902-11ea-8aef-5abd21c63111.png)\r\nAs you can also see (L156), the code is generated as `ɵɵdirectiveInject(ChangeDetectorRef)` instead of `ɵɵinjectPipeChangeDetectorRef()`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-8x6a4f\r\n\r\nYou can see, it works with uncompiled code, but not with the included library ngx-function-expression, which uses cdRef exactly like the TestPipe.

Currently, things are not working well with Angular 10 because the lock file path is hard-coded into the node_modules directory, and ngcc seems to randomly fail when it sometimes finds a lock file already in place.\r\n\r\nThe location of the lock file is hard-coded in https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d1ea1f4c7f3358b730b0d94e65b00bc28cae279c/packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/locking/lock_file.ts#L11\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this could either be configurable, or not inside node_modules, but instead in a tmp directory near where the ng build command is being executed.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nError: Lock found, but no process with PID 40 seems to be running.\r\n(If you are sure no ngcc process is running then you should delete the lock-file at /builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/__ngcc_lock_file__.)\r\n    at new TimeoutError (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/locking/async_locker.js:18:51)\r\n    at AsyncLocker.<anonymous> (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/locking/async_locker.js:111:47)\r\n    at step (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:140:27)\r\n    at Object.next (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:121:57)\r\n    at /builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:114:75\r\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Object.__awaiter (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:110:16)\r\n    at AsyncLocker.create (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/locking/async_locker.js:68:28)\r\n    at AsyncLocker.<anonymous> (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/locking/async_locker.js:51:59)\r\n    at step (/builds/core-build/vmw-ngx-components/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:140:27)\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: NGCC failed.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n\r\n10","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38875","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"can't run multiple ngcc builds in parallel from a single node_modules\" (#38875)"},{"Id":"703012765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T19:18:57","Actor":"mgechev","Number":"38874","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add upcoming angular conferences","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/11.0.0-next.1...11.0.0-next.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **common:** do not round up fractions of a millisecond in `DatePipe` ([#&#8203;38009](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38009)) ([26f2820](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/26f2820)), closes [/www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15](https://togithub.com//www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1//issues/sec-15) [#&#8203;37989](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37989)\n-   **common:** mark locale data arrays as readonly ([#&#8203;30397](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/30397)) ([6acea54](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6acea54)), closes [#&#8203;27003](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/27003)\n-   **compiler:** source span for microsyntax text att should be key span ([#&#8203;38766](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38766)) ([8f349b2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8f349b2))\n-   **router:** Fix arguments order for call to shouldReuseRoute ([#&#8203;26949](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/26949)) ([3817e5f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3817e5f)), closes [#&#8203;16192](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/16192) [#&#8203;16192](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/16192)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** `TemplateTypeChecker` operation to get `Symbol` from a template node ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([c4556db](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4556db))\n-   **compiler-cli:** Add ability to get `Symbol` of `Template`s and `Element`s in component template ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([cf2e8b9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/cf2e8b9))\n-   **compiler-cli:** Add ability to get `Symbol` of AST expression in component template ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([f56ece4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f56ece4))\n-   **compiler-cli:** add ability to get symbol of reference or variable ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([19598b4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/19598b4))\n-   **compiler-cli:** define interfaces to be used for TemplateTypeChecker ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([9e77bd3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9e77bd3))\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** only emit directive/pipe references that are used ([#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)) ([077f516](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/077f516))\n-   **compiler-cli:** optimize computation of type-check scope information ([#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)) ([297c060](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/297c060))\n-   **router:** use `ngDevMode` to tree-shake error messages in router ([#&#8203;38674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38674)) ([db21c4f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/db21c4f))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** This change corrects the argument order when calling\n    RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute. Previously, when evaluating child\n    routes, they would be called with the future and current arguments would\n    be swapped. If your RouteReuseStrategy relies specifically on only the future\n    or current snapshot state, you may need to update the shouldReuseRoute\n    implementation's use of \"future\" and \"current\" ActivateRouteSnapshots.\n-   **common:** The locale data API has been marked as returning readonly arrays, rather\n    than mutable arrays, since these arrays are shared across calls to the\n    API. If you were mutating them (e.g. calling `sort()`, `push()`, `splice()`, etc)\n    then your code will not longer compile. If you need to mutate the array, you\n    should now take a copy (e.g. by calling `slice()`) and mutate the copy.\n-   **common:** When passing a date-time formatted string to the `DatePipe` in a format that contains\n    fractions of a millisecond, the milliseconds will now always be rounded down rather than\n    to the nearest millisecond.\n\nMost applications will not be affected by this change. If this is not the desired behaviour\nthen consider pre-processing the string to round the millisecond part before passing\nit to the `DatePipe`.\n\n#### 10.1.2 (2020-09-16)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** detect pipes in ICUs in template binder ([#&#8203;38810](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38810)) ([ec2dbe7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ec2dbe7)), closes [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)\n-   **core:** clear the `RefreshTransplantedView` when detached ([#&#8203;38768](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38768)) ([edb7f90](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/edb7f90)), closes [#&#8203;38619](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38619)\n-   **localize:** ensure that `formatOptions` is optional ([#&#8203;38787](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38787)) ([a47383d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a47383d))\n-   **router:** Ensure routes are processed in priority order and only if needed ([#&#8203;38780](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38780)) ([9c51ba3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9c51ba3)), closes [#&#8203;38691](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38691)\n-   **upgrade:** add try/catch when downgrading injectables ([#&#8203;38671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38671)) ([5de2ac3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5de2ac3)), closes [#&#8203;37579](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37579)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** only emit directive/pipe references that are used ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([5658405](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5658405))\n-   **compiler-cli:** optimize computation of type-check scope information ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([ebede67](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ebede67))\n-   **ngcc:** introduce cache for sharing data across entry-points ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([58411e7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/58411e7))\n-   **ngcc:** reduce maximum worker count ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([ea36466](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ea36466))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When the application it is modified at any point, and CLI recompile it, the application crash and it shows the following error in browser console:\r\n\r\nError: Type AppComponent is part of the declarations of 2 modules: AppModule and AppModule! Please consider moving AppComponent to a higher module that imports AppModule and AppModule. You can also create a new NgModule that exports and includes AppComponent then import that NgModule in AppModule and AppModule.\r\n\r\nI have read that this error should appear in case the component is declared in two modules, but in the case it is saying that a component is being declared at the same module.

For some of the examples such as **\"Comparison Ranges\"**, **\" Setting the selected date\"**, **\" Changing the datepicker colors\"** etc, there are multiple datepickers used. The programmatic label for calendar icon is not unique to Screen readers, since the aria-label is the same for all.\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the Date picker documentation: https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/\r\n2. Navigate to one of the sections that has multiple date picker fields mentioned above.\r\n3. Run JAWS/VoiceOver/NVDA (any screen reader can be used)\r\n4. Verify whether the calendar icon communicates unique accessible names or provide a way to update it (Issue)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nThere needs to be a way to provide unique labels for the calendar icons, if there are more than one date picker fields used in the page. The aria-label for the calendar icon has a value of \"Open calendar\". There needs to be an alternate way for Screen readers users to differentiate the calendar icon associations to the input field. Using the component as is in the application, there is no means to update the aria-label for the calendar icons.\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"Angular Material - Date Picker - Labels not unique for calendar icons\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287261/93385730-a2b54d00-f834-11ea-9e9d-e312d8cbad14.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nIf there are multiple date picker fields, Screen readers will render the same redundant labels making it difficult for Screen readers to differentiate.

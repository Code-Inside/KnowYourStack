Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nReactive Forms are currently not strongly typed. This leads to a suboptimal developer experience and does not catch common mistakes (e.g. typos).\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #13721\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThere are (/have been) multiple attempts to make FormArray, FormControl and FormGroup type safe. My proposal is different compared to the already existing ones: Instead of directly making these three classes type safe, I have introduced three new classes: StrictFormArray, StrictFormControl and StrictFormGroup (inheriting from their non-strict variants).  \r\nDevelopers have to define a separate \"form model\" that describes the structure of the form. Once this has been done, you get lots of benefits, including support for code suggestions/autocompletion, warnings when accessing non-existing controls, etc.\r\n\r\nBenefits compared to other approaches:\r\n- Guaranteed not to be a breaking change\r\n- Developers can gradually migrate to this optional API\r\n- StrictFormControls can still hold objects and not only primitive values\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n- Developers need to define a separate form model, so they have to type more (pun intended)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI was running the tests on a pretty slow computer, so many just timed out (`FirefoxHeadless failed 2 times (timeout). Giving up.`) Hoping for CI to provide the results.\r\n\r\nSince my PR basically only includes a new model, I did not know how if I had to create new tests. If so, I would be happy about a small explanation/example on how these tests should look like. My thoughts: I am literally only forwarding calls to the super classes, so there isn't be much that could break.\r\n\r\n(And one small thing: Most of the examples from the docs are based on ones of the respective non-strict version.)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38906","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add strict reactive forms api\" (#38906)"},{"Id":"704863846","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-19T11:20:54","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"38905","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(docs-infra): add unit tests for rxjs examples","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds missing unit tests for all rxjs examples from the docs.\r\n\r\nCloses #28017\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(docs-infra): add unit tests for rxjs examples\" (#38905)"},{"Id":"704804862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-19T05:14:10","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"38904","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(zone.js): monkey patches queueMicrotask()","State":"open","Body":"Close #38863\r\n\r\nMonkey patches `queueMicrotask()` API, so the callback runs in the zone\r\nwhen scheduled, and also the task is run as `microTask`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nZone.current.fork({\r\n  name: 'queueMicrotask',\r\n  onScheduleTask: (delegate: ZoneDelegate, curr: Zone, target: Zone, task: Task) => {\r\n    logs.push(task.type);\r\n    logs.push(task.source);\r\n    return delegate.scheduleTask(target, task);\r\n  }\r\n}).run(() => {\r\n    queueMicrotask(() => {\r\n      expect(logs).toEqual(['microTask', 'queueMicrotask']);\r\n      expect(Zone.current.name).toEqual('queueMicrotask');\r\n      done();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38904","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(zone.js): monkey patches queueMicrotask()\" (#38904)"},{"Id":"704596568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-18T23:55:58","Actor":"atscott","Number":"38902","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): refactor ast spans test to be more human readable","State":"closed","Body":"The current tests print out the span numbers, which are really difficult to verify\r\nsince it requires manually going to the template string and looking at what\r\ncharacters appear within those indexes.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

([#&#8203;38009](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38009)) ([26f2820](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/26f2820)), closes

**common:** mark locale data arrays as readonly ([#&#8203;30397](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/30397)) ([6acea54](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6acea54)), closes [#&#8203;27003](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/27003)\n-   **compiler:** source span for microsyntax text att should be key span ([#&#8203;38766](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38766)) ([8f349b2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8f349b2))\n-   **router:** Fix arguments order for call to shouldReuseRoute ([#&#8203;26949](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/26949)) ([3817e5f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3817e5f)), closes

operation to get `Symbol` from a template node ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([c4556db](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4556db))\n-   **compiler-cli:** Add ability to get `Symbol` of `Template`s and `Element`s in component template ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([cf2e8b9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/cf2e8b9))\n-   **compiler-cli:** Add ability to get `Symbol` of AST expression in component template ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([f56ece4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f56ece4))\n-   **compiler-cli:** add ability to get symbol of reference or variable ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([19598b4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/19598b4))\n-   **compiler-cli:** define interfaces to be used for TemplateTypeChecker ([#&#8203;38618](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38618)) ([9e77bd3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9e77bd3))\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** only emit directive/pipe references that are used ([#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)) ([077f516](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/077f516))\n-   **compiler-cli:** optimize computation of type-check scope information ([#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)) ([297c060](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/297c060))\n-   **router:** use `ngDevMode` to tree-shake error messages in router ([#&#8203;38674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38674)) ([db21c4f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/db21c4f))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** This change corrects the argument order when calling\n    RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute. Previously, when evaluating child\n    routes, they would be called with the future and current arguments would\n    be swapped. If your RouteReuseStrategy relies specifically on only the future\n    or current snapshot state, you may need to update the shouldReuseRoute\n    implementation's use of \"future\" and \"current\" ActivateRouteSnapshots.\n-   **common:** The locale data API has been marked as returning readonly arrays, rather\n    than mutable arrays, since these arrays are shared across calls to the\n    API. If you were mutating them (e.g. calling `sort()`, `push()`, `splice()`, etc)\n    then your code will not longer compile. If you need to mutate the array, you\n    should now take a copy (e.g. by calling `slice()`) and mutate the copy.\n-   **common:** When passing a date-time formatted string to the `DatePipe` in a format that contains\n    fractions of a millisecond, the milliseconds will now always be rounded down rather than\n    to the nearest millisecond.\n\nMost applications will not be affected by this change. If this is not the desired behaviour\nthen consider pre-processing the string to round the millisecond part before passing\nit to the `DatePipe`.\n\n#### 10.1.2 (2020-09-16)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** detect pipes in ICUs in template binder ([#&#8203;38810](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38810)) ([ec2dbe7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ec2dbe7)), closes [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539) [#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)\n-   **core:** clear the `RefreshTransplantedView` when detached ([#&#8203;38768](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38768)) ([edb7f90](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/edb7f90)), closes [#&#8203;38619](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38619)\n-   **localize:** ensure that `formatOptions` is optional ([#&#8203;38787](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38787)) ([a47383d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a47383d))\n-   **router:** Ensure routes are processed in priority order and only if needed ([#&#8203;38780](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38780)) ([9c51ba3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9c51ba3)), closes [#&#8203;38691](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38691)\n-   **upgrade:** add try/catch when downgrading injectables ([#&#8203;38671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38671)) ([5de2ac3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5de2ac3)), closes [#&#8203;37579](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37579)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** only emit directive/pipe references that are used ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([5658405](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5658405))\n-   **compiler-cli:** optimize computation of type-check scope information ([#&#8203;38843](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38843)) ([ebede67](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ebede67))\n-   **ngcc:** introduce cache for sharing data across entry-points ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([58411e7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/58411e7))\n-   **ngcc:** reduce maximum worker count ([#&#8203;38840](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38840)) ([ea36466](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ea36466))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For some of the examples such as **\"Comparison Ranges\"**, **\" Setting the selected date\"**, **\" Changing the datepicker colors\"** etc, there are multiple datepickers used. The programmatic label for calendar icon is not unique to Screen readers, since the aria-label is the same for all.\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the Date picker documentation: https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/\r\n2. Navigate to one of the sections that has multiple date picker fields mentioned above.\r\n3. Run JAWS/VoiceOver/NVDA (any screen reader can be used)\r\n4. Verify whether the calendar icon communicates unique accessible names or provide a way to update it (Issue)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nThere needs to be a way to provide unique labels for the calendar icons, if there are more than one date picker fields used in the page. The aria-label for the calendar icon has a value of \"Open calendar\". There needs to be an alternate way for Screen readers users to differentiate the calendar icon associations to the input field. Using the component as is in the application, there is no means to update the aria-label for the calendar icons.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"942\" alt=\"Angular Material - Date Picker - Labels not unique for calendar icons\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287261/93607645-9a295780-f997-11ea-85d0-c78a875b2575.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nIf there are multiple date picker fields, Screen readers will render the same redundant labels making it difficult for Screen readers to differentiate.

This new API aims to explore how signals can be leveraged to create a more declarative, intuitive, and reactive way of handling forms.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this new signal-based approach are:\r\n\r\n*   **Signal-centric Design:** Place signals at the core of the forms experience, enabling a truly reactive programming model for form state and logic.\r\n*   **Declarative Logic:** Allow developers to define form behavior, such as validation and conditional fields, declaratively using TypeScript. This moves logic out of the template and into a typed, testable schema.\r\n*   **Developer-Owned Data Model:** The library does not maintain a copy of data in a form model, but instead read and write it via a developer-provided `WritableSignal`, eliminating the need for applications to synchronize their data with the form system.\r\n*   **Interoperability:** A key design goal is seamless interoperability with existing reactive forms, allowing for incremental adoption.\r\n*   **Bridging Template and Reactive Forms:** This exploration hopes to close the gap between template and reactive forms, offering a unified and more powerful approach that combines the best aspects of both.\r\n\r\nThis initial version of the experimental API includes the core building blocks, such as the `form()` function, `Field` and `FieldState` objects, and a `[control]` directive for binding to UI elements. It also introduces a schema-based system for defining validation, conditional logic, and other form behaviors.\r\n\r\nNote: This is an early, experimental API. It is not yet complete and is subject to change based on feedback and further exploration.\r\n\r\nCloses #63293","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63408","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add experimental signal-based forms\" (#63408)"},{"Id":"3357174595","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-26T21:39:00","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"63407","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): rename private access utilities","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63407","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(forms): rename private access utilities\" (#63407)"},{"Id":"3352951971","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-26T20:20:46","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63381","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): Add experimental support for the Navigation API","State":"closed","Body":"The navigation API is part of interop 2025.

The requirements are:\n1. Structure: backdrop > container > content\n2. The container animation must be longer than the backdrop animation \n3. I need to know when the animations (both enter and leave) have finished\n\n### 1. `animate.leave` doesn't emit animationend\nReferring to the comment (https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/62212#discussioncomment-13595428), the preferred way to react to animation events is now through native browser events. Unfortunately, in the case of `animate.leave`, it seems that neither `animationend` nor `animationcancel` is emitted.\n\n### 2. Nested animations\nI want to add animations to the 'backdrop ' and 'container'. I've tested two ways to achieve my goal:\n1. Nested attributes `animate`\n```\n<backdrop animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n    <container animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n        ...content\n    </container>\n</backdrop>\n```\n2. Nested styles with animation\n```\n<style>\n    backdrop.enter { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.enter > container { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.leave { animation: ... }\n    backdrop.leave > container { animation: ... }\n</style>\n\n<backdrop animate.enter=\"...\" animate.leave=\"...\">\n    <container>\n        ...content\n    </container>\n</backdrop>\n```\n\nIn the first approach, `animate.enter` works correctly, but `animate.leave` for the `container` does not fire at all.\nIn the second attempt, the enter and leave animations for the `container` are interrupted.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how this situation with nested animations should work, but I think the more natural approach is the first one, and the nested 'animate' should also be notified when the parent is destroyed. The question remains whether a nested animation should prevent its parent from being destroyed.\n\nI am aware that I can achieve this with `(animate)` or a second approach with animations of equal duration.\n\n### 3. Class-based animation termination\nAccording to documentation (https://angular.dev/guide/animations#event-bindings-functions-and-third-party-libraries):\n\n> If you don't call animationComplete() when using [animate.leave](https://angular.dev/api/animations/animate#leave), Angular calls the function automatically after a four-second delay.\n\nThis information is incomplete, as animations based on CSS classes also terminate after 4 seconds. This can be misleading, as the documentation suggests that the timeout only serves as a safeguard against a missing call `animationComplete()`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/kyent3r4?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.2.0\nNode: 22.17.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\n\nAngular: 20.2.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2002.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.2.0\n@angular-devkit/core            20.2.0 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.2.0\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.0\n@angular/cli                    20.2.0\n@schematics/angular             20.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"nested animations don't behave as expected\" (#63388)"},{"Id":"3353173477","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-25T20:48:34","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"63387","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): wrap `checkNoChanges` body in `if (ngDevMode)` for better tree-shaking","State":"open","Body":"The `checkNoChanges` method previously used an early-return guard:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  if (!ngDevMode) return;\r\n  // dev-only code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn production builds, `ngDevMode` is replaced with `false`, so the guard compiles to `return;`.

Which is defined in `@angular/build` package. It's good to understand that karma uses the di library for it's dependency injection. The `AngularPolyfillsPlugin` is defined in such a way. The type is set to `factory` and a function is provided, which is run by karma. All is fine so far, however karma expects the factory function to return a reporter. This is currently not happening. It just returns undefined.\n\nWhen using the `karma test explorer` plugin for `Visual Code` karma will load all defined reporters in the MultiReporter defined in `multi.js` in the karma project class. This will access the adapters property of every reporter and push to it.\n\nThe problem is, the factory function of the  `angular-polyfills` reporter returns undefined. Therefor kamra crashes on startup if run with multiple reporters, which it does in case of the `Karma Test Explorer` extension. If the factory function would return `{ adapters:[] }` all works fine and `Karma Test Explorer` is all happy again, because now karma does not crash when executed. \n\nHowever I am not an expert at all in karma reporters and the di library. So it is very well possible, some other solution, change is more appropriate to fix this issue. And I am fully aware karma is deprecated, but because there is no stable, non experimental replacement available just yet, I would really really appreciate it, if this plugin get fixed so karma will work again in scenarios other as `ng test`.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.6\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.5.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.6\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.6\n@angular/build               20.2.0\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.0\n@angular/cli                 20.1.6\n@schematics/angular          20.1.6\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31039","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Karma reporter:angular-polyfills factory does not return a reporter which breaks karma in some situations\" (#31039)"},{"Id":"3355447356","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-26T13:45:50","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31038","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: removing WSL for a simpler, more performant approach","State":"closed","Body":"We've been using a complex workflow with WSL to run our E2E tests on CI.

We have this scenario:\n\n- foo.com/en has the compiled i18n version of the `en` locale\n- foo.com/sv has the compiled i18n version of the `sv` locale\n- foo.com has an Express proxy server `server.proxy.mjs` that creates a route for `/en` and `/sv`:\n\n```\nimport { app as appEN } from './server/en/server.mjs';\nimport { app as appSV } from './server/sv/server.mjs';\n\nserver.use('/en', appEN());\nserver.use('/sv', appSV());\n```\n\nThere are two main problems I've encountered when trying to get this to work:\n\n1. Including the proxy file for compilation\n2. Writing it to `dist/apps/public` instead of `dist/apps/public/browser/<locale>` using the glob pattern in `targets.build.options.assets` will lead to an error saying you're not allowed to write to files outside of the output path\n\nI briefly looked at the `targets.build.options.scripts` but that seems more for external third party scripts that would normally go inside the `<head>` tag.\n\nWhat I've been forced into doing is have a `server.proxy.mjs` file that I have to copy over with a separate script after the build is done, that I can then start in Docker with `CMD [\"node\", \"./dist/apps/public/server.proxy.mjs\"]`.\n\nThere are pretty obvious cons here:\n\n- No type safety\n- Having to use a separate script entirely just to copy over the file to the dist\n- Having import statement to each locale's compiled server app like `import { app as appSV } from './server/sv/server.mjs';` that doesn't exist before you build, in order to set up a route for it using `server.use('/sv', appSV());`, so using a `.ts` file doesn't work even if you were to get the rest of the file to compile.\n\nThere are likely more that I've encountered and forgotten at this point.\n\nI've also tried to manually compile this with tools like `tsc` and `esbuild` but I cannot do so without getting error after error or completely wrong outputs in the dist folder.\n\nI feel like it shouldn't have to be this painful to make i18n work with SSR when you require a proxy.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince the problem is not one thing, but rather several, the solution must take this into consideration.\n\nIt would be really nice if I could have this inside `angular.json`:\n\n```\n  \"name\": \"public\",\n  ...\n  \"i18n\": {\n    \"sourceLocale\": \"en\",\n    \"locales\": {\n      \"sv\": \"apps/public/src/i18n/sv.json\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"i18nProxyServer\": \"apps/public/server.proxy.ts\" // Perhaps this could even be inside the \"i18n\" field as a \"proxyServer\" field instead\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis would do two things:\n1. Include `apps/public/server.proxy.ts` for compilation\n2. _Somehow_ give access to the correct import statement for each locale in order to create the route. Ideally you would be able to call a method imported from `@angular/localize` that could give you this information, or something that could be replaced at build time similar to how `$localize.locale` works. Something that would allow you to do like:\n\n```\n  // geti18nImports would already know what project it is, and where to look in dist folder\n  import { geti18nImports } from '@angular/localize';\n\n  // Would return something like [{ code: 'en', importPath: () => import('./server/en/server.mjs').default }]\n  const allLocales = geti18nImports();\n\n  // From here you can simply loop over each locale and create a route for it\n  for (const locale of allLocales) {\n    server.use(`/${locale.code}`, await locale.importPath());\n  }\n```\n\nor with the `$localize.locale` methodology:\n\n```\nserver.use('/en', await $localize.importPath('en').default);\nserver.use('/sv', await $localize.importPath('sv').default);\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone in terms of solutions to the proxy problem. But we've also considered having a country select page at foo.com that can link to each locale, but since that's also extremely difficult to do with i18n without creating an entirely separate application, we've been forced out of that option.\n\nI struggle to see any alternative solutions to the problems mentioned, but I'm hoping to hearing what the team's thought around this topic is.\n\nI've seen comments in the past that this is more related to hosting rather than the framework, but if the framework doesn't allow you to host the application(s) in a clean and streamlined way, I think that's problem that needs urgent solving.\n\nI am open to hearing alternative solutions from the team, whether about a new solution entirely or a way to go about this that already exists.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31037","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Better i18n + SSR support (allow proxy server to be included in build)\" (#31037)"},{"Id":"3355113400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-26T11:32:32","Actor":"PieterjanDeClippel","Number":"31036","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): Spec standalone check (defaults to true now) (#31035)","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I noticed that problems started from versions higher then v11.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open latest documentation of the stepper: https://material.angular.dev/components/stepper/overview\n(at the time of writing, it's v20.2.0)\n2.

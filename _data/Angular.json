The implementation works fine in the Angular 18 browser build system, but it fails to catch exceptions in the new Angular 18 build system.\n\nHere’s a simplified version of my CustomErrorHandler:\n\n\n```\nimport { ErrorHandler, Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Subject } from 'rxjs';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {\n  private onUnhandledException = new Subject();\n  onUnhandledException$ = this.onUnhandledException.asObservable();\n  isErrorHandled = false;\n\n  handleError(errorObj) {\n    if (this.isErrorHandled) {\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    this.onUnhandledException.next(errorObj);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn my Handler.service.ts, I subscribe to the onUnhandledException$ observable:\n\n```\nconstructor(\n  @Inject(ErrorHandler) private errorHandler: CustomErrorHandler,\n  private zone: NgZone\n) {\n  this.errorHandler.onUnhandledException$.subscribe({\n    next: (error) => {                \n      this.shutdownApplication();\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIssue: When an exception is thrown from the backend, it correctly calls handleError() and emits the exceptions in the Angular 18 browser build system.

It seems that the vite dev server follows the behavior of `AngularNodeAppEngine` and is blocking us from upgrading to v19.\n\nSomething odd is that `AngularNodeAppEngine` will render `/` as `test` but `/asdfasdf` as `404 not found`. `CommonEngine` renders `test` for both of these paths.\n\nSome debugging found that https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/249f9dc26caa4f3fe3cf9799588955cd27f51791/packages/angular/ssr/src/routes/ng-routes.ts#L606 is likely to blame. It flattens the route tree in a way that the nested wildcard route gets overridden by the non-nested one during the insert into the final route tree https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/249f9dc26caa4f3fe3cf9799588955cd27f51791/packages/angular/ssr/src/routes/ng-routes.ts#L722\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`AngularNodeAppEngine` - https://github.com/griest024/ng19-server-routing\n`CommonEngine` - https://github.com/griest024/ng19-server-routing/tree/common-engine\n\n1. run `npx ng b && npm run serve:ssr:19-dev-server-routes`\n2. navigate to `/asdfasdfasdf` or any other route that is not `/` or `/not-found`\n3. See that the rendered component is different.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.5\nNode: 18.20.5\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                    19.1.5\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.5\n@schematics/angular             19.1.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`AngularNodeAppEngine` has different unknown path routing behavior than `CommonEngine`\" (#29539)"},{"Id":"2819348692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-29T21:18:05","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29538","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): support per component updates of multi-component files","State":"open","Body":"The HMR component update candidate analysis has been improved to now perform more fine-grained checks for cases where more than one component is present in a single TypeScript file.

Created a local copy of @angular/build in our project.\n2. Updated the vite version to 6.0.9 in the local copy's package.json.\n3. Modified our main package.json to use the local copy of @angular/build.\n\nThis approach allowed us to use a non-vulnerable version of vite without waiting for an official update to @angular/build.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n## Steps to Reproduce (for verification)\n\n1. Create a new Angular App via Angular/CLI\n2. Run `npm audit` to confirm \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nng version  \nNode.js version v23.5.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

Update the vite dependency in @angular/build to version 6.0.9 or later.\n2. Release a new version of @angular/build with this security fix.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the hard work and dedication of the Angular team in maintaining such a robust and feature-rich framework. Your commitment to security and continuous improvement is commendable. We hope this report helps in further enhancing the security of the Angular ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

I would also expect that the open state is kept when only part of the tree is changed (in the example one subtree is removed, the other persists) and a trackby function is given.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nTree is closed and not interactive anymore.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18/19\n- CDK/Material: 18/19\n- Browser(s): all\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30403","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-tree): CDK Tree can't be opened when trackBy function is used after update of datasource\" (#30403)"},{"Id":"2814386843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-28T07:18:07","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"30400","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: updates buttons with icons a11y recommendations","State":"closed","Body":"Updates Buttons with icons documentation to recommend that any icon button be a minimum of 48x48 to be fully accessible and easily clickable on smaller screens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30400","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: updates buttons with icons a11y recommendations\" (#30400)"},{"Id":"2813890271","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T19:35:00","Actor":"clamli","Number":"30399","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatRadioButton): The `required` attribute is used on a radio button","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen used in a radio group, the `required` attribute is used on a radio button. All the radio buttons under the group have `required` attributes. This attribute should not be used on individual radio buttons, because that creates illogical meta-data, which may be confusing for assistive technology users. It's not the individual controls that are required, it's the group as a whole that must have one choice made from it.\n\nCode reference: https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/third_party/javascript/angular_components/src/material/radio/radio.ts;l=250-257;bpv=1;bpt=1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a radio button is used inside a radio group, if the group is required and does not have a default selection, then add `aria-required=\"true\"` to the wrapping element, not `aria-required/required` to the individual controls. We can leave it unchanged when a radio button is used outside a radio group, though I am unsure if that is a valid use case. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `required` attribute is applied to each radio button in a group.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30399","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatRadioButton): The `required` attribute is used on a radio button\" (#30399)"},{"Id":"2812901932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T16:21:18","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30394","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to Angular 19.1 stable","State":"closed","Body":"Updates to the stable version of Angular 19.1.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30394","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to Angular 19.1 stable\" (#30394)"},{"Id":"2813179792","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T16:18:17","Actor":"gonzalad","Number":"30398","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(table): localize aria-sort attribute","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThe aria-sort value is hardcoded in MatSortHeader  to none, ascending or descending.\n\nCould the material library provide a way to localize its value (i.e. german, french, etc...) ?\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/a08eeebf6b334e00a491496829e3838d0616258a/src/material/sort/sort-header.ts#L242-L248\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30398","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(table): localize aria-sort attribute\" (#30398)"},{"Id":"2813139044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T14:41:49","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30397","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/sidenav): fix sidenav not working (#30390)","State":"closed","Body":"fixes broken example for responsive sidebar which included routerLink directive but is missing router module which prevents sidebar from opening by removing directive as it serve no purpose\r\n\r\nfixes #30307","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30397","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(material/sidenav): fix sidenav not working (#30390)\" (#30397)"},{"Id":"2812990069","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T13:09:54","Actor":"naaajii","Number":"30396","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: clear input field whenever a selection is made in chips autocomplete example","State":"open","Body":"fixes #30339","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30396","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: clear input field whenever a selection is made in chips autocomplete example\" (#30396)"},{"Id":"2812939024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T12:48:12","Actor":"naaajii","Number":"30395","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): trigger CD when form gets reassigned","State":"open","Body":"fixes the issue we were not marking component for changes when form is reassigned making it not update UI for required asterisk\r\n\r\nfixes #29066","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30395","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/form-field): trigger CD when form gets reassigned\" (#30395)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-01-31T03:30:02.6901962Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1651}

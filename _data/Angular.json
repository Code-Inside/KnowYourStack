Description\r\n\r\nI am trying to extend an abstract class on `:host` selector and it works well until my abstract class has some nested selector styles.\r\nImagine this:\r\n```scss\r\n%test-hover {\r\n  color: green;\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    color: gray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n:host {\r\n  @extend %test-hover;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt generates this:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100] {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut should generate this:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100] {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n[_nghost-dxc-c100]:hover {\r\n  color: gray;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever it works fine when the nested selector does not have `&`.\r\n```scss\r\n%test-hover {\r\n  color: green;\r\n  :hover {\r\n    color: gray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n:host {\r\n  @extend %test-hover;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nProduces

That is, duplicate navigations can happen and\r\nrouting should still complete successfully.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that, when this duplicate navigation occurs, all angular resolves and guards are running twice for the route.  As a result of upgrading to @angular/router@13.2.6, all of our resolves are running twice, making duplicate server requests for many of our pages. In one instance where this was found, it actually completely broke navigation as the second network request of the same payload will always error out. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n@angular/router: 13.2.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI was quite shocked that this change specifically was not at all documented in the changelog for 13.2.6, as this seems very breaking to me.

If you don't provide a PAT token, Scorecards will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` available in the workflow. Due to limitations of the permissions model and GitHub APIs, be aware of the following limitations:\n\n1.  Without a PAT, the Branch-Protection is not supported, so it will be disabled. You will not receive alerts for this check.\n2.  Scorecards only supports PAT on private repositories. If you want to install Scorecards on a private repository, you still need to use a PAT.\n\nFor more information, visit the [README.md](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/v1.1.0#readme)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;rohankh532](https://togithub.com/rohankh532) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112)\n-   [@&#8203;justaugustus](https://togithub.com/justaugustus) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126)\n-   [@&#8203;jamietanna](https://togithub.com/jamietanna) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145)\n-   [@&#8203;jonasbb](https://togithub.com/jonasbb) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129)\n-   [@&#8203;azeemshaikh38](https://togithub.com/azeemshaikh38) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10pm on monday,before 4am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Only non-mutating requests (GET and HEAD) are cached.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to think that a PUT request will be relayed through the service worker to the API (but not cached), and that the response also will on the way back.\r\n\r\nWhat really happens is that the service worker responds with a 504 Gateway Timeout. If I bypass the service worker, I get a status code 0 (which is what I was expecting because I read it somewhere in the Angular docs I think, though I can't find it again).\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on how one is supposed to handle detecting that the app is missing connection?\r\n- Are you supposed to bypass the service worker to be able to detect this?\r\n- If not, is a 504 response code from the service worker expected for a PUT method when offline? Or am I missing something?\r\n- Is 504 a better way of detecting network issues than 0 (as it seems like code 0 is a generic error code)?\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this behavior would be documented on the referred page. If this isn't related to the Angular implementation of the service worker, but more a question about how service workers are supposed to work in general, let me know. I couldn't find any good resources on the subject.\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/service-worker-config\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Arguments like `noBuild`, `noSilent`, `noDotFiles` no longer work, but `buildTarget` and `dryRun` do. I assume this is related with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22778 and the fact that Yargs supports `--no-flags`. In the past, the word `no` had no meaning, now it has one: https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/main/docs/tricks.md#negate\r\n\r\nIn Angular 13 i was able write `no-build` as an argument and it was used as it-is, but now this is interpreted as the negation of `build` – which is an unknown argument. This breaks a couple of builders that all share some code/ideas and use the same argument called `no-build`.\r\n\r\n* [@netlify-builder/deploy](https://github.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder/blob/b915395041d61d460f3a312c1a9c7cc9a683cda2/src/deploy/schema.json#L17)\r\n* [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages#no-build)\r\n* as well as [ngx-deploy-docker](https://github.com/kauppfbi/ngx-deploy-docker), [ngx-deploy-npm](https://github.com/bikecoders/ngx-deploy-npm), and [ngx-deploy-ftp](https://github.com/bohoffi/ngx-deploy-ftp)\r\n* there could be more...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nPlease follow our [README for contributors](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/blob/master/docs/README_contributors.md), which is essentially:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the project\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   git clone https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages.git\r\n   cd angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Install the dependencies\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd src\r\n   npm install\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Build the project:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm run build\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Create a local npm link:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd dist\r\n   npm link\r\n   ```\r\n \r\n 5. Go to a new folder and create a fresh angular project:\r\n \r\n    ```sh\r\n    ng new test\r\n    cd test\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n6. Add the local version of `angular-cli-ghpages`.\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm link angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n7. Now execute the `ng-add` schematic.\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ng add angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n6. This will work, but will complain about a missing git configuration (which is fine here)\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ng deploy\r\n   ng deploy --dry-run\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n6. But this will NOT work, same for all other arguments with a \"no\" in the name\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ng deploy --no-build\r\n   ```   \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>ng deploy --no-build\r\nError: Unknown argument: build\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 14.0.2\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23397","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression on command line arguments parser\" (#23397)"},{"Id":"1275806647","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T19:16:41","Actor":"devversion","Number":"23399","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: ensure ng-dev command works on windows","State":"closed","Body":"Apparently the `ng-dev` command does not work with Git Bash on windows\r\nbecause of the environment variable being set.

It doesn't happen every time, but often enough. There's no noticeable pattern / precondition.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen **opening** the dialog the content appears blank for ~5 seconds. Actually the component is rendered but only partially, e.g. the `mat-form-field` and the `input` is there, but not the `mat-label`. Same with some attributes and other parts like `mat-dialog-title`, which is there but has no content yet. The content is just a simple text from a pure pipe.\r\nI've checked this by quickly getting the `outerHTML` of the `overlay-container` during and after the blank phase.\r\n\r\nThen after those ~5 seconds everything is displayed and working.\r\nYou can also see that the blank dialog starts the close animation before the proper dialog is shown.

In addition the MDC version living under `material-experimental/mdc-core` still exists as well. The plan when moving MDC components out of material-experimental is:\r\n   1. The non MDC theme should be moved from core all-themes to legacy-core all-themes\r\n   2. The MDC theme should be added to core all-themes\r\n   3.

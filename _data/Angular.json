This option currently controls the extraction and emit of Angular class metadata. This emitted information is only needed in AOT mode when using certain TestBed APIs. However, AOT mode is currently not available for unit testing within the Angular CLI. As a result, the metadata is not used within CLI generation applications and in particular production applications. Without this option, the CLI needs to manually perform a code transform to remove the metadata and also replicate TypeScript's import eliding. This is can be a complicated operation and must be continually kept up to date with any changes to both the Angular compiler and TypeScript. The introduction of this new option alleviates these concerns.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a bonus cleanup commit that removes some leftover ngcc related code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50604","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): add internal compiler option to control class metadata emit\" (#50604)"},{"Id":"1745233575","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-07T19:47:22","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"50600","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): error when reading compiled input transforms metadata in JIT mode","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes an error that surfaced in #50580 where the compiler was throwing an error in JIT mode when reading the result of `compileDirectiveDeclaration`.

As more developers start using input transform they might expect these usecases to work.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport transform function with complex typing\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMaybe allow only few preset transform function like coerceToBoolean.

I have come across Issue angular/angular#49194, which suggests to use `ngc --noEmit`. This solution seems to work fine, except we are using scss for our styles and this results in errors such as:\r\n```output\r\nCouldn't resolve resource vars_mixins from /path/to/component/some.component.scss\r\n```\r\nThese errors seem to be caused by shorthand imports such as\r\n```scss\r\n@import 'vars_mixins';\r\n```\r\nand can be fixed by using absolute file paths and file extensions. However, this is not an option for style files imported from `node_modules` which will usually include shorthand imports such as the one shown above (e.g. bootstrap).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to work around this issue? It seems that preprocessor options are only defined in `angular.json`, which means I would have to run the preprocessor step manually before running `ngc` to get this working?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIdeally there should be a way to run a simple type check with the angular CLI similar to what tools like [svelte-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-check) achieve.\r\n\r\n###

the end saving a report at the root folder (outside of src).\r\nthis report causes reloading, while its not part of the project, and not consumed by any module.\r\n\r\ncan we limit the detected parts to be only from the \"src\" folder?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nng serve\r\ncreate or save a file which is outside of the project, and not consumed by any part of the project.\r\nsee esbuild

Right-click on a range (two-handle) slider. It will mark one handle as focused (ripple is displayed)\r\n2. Close the context menu (by clicking outside)\r\n3. Click anywhere else on the page, including other focusable elements\r\n4. Go back to the focused slider and try to drag the other handle (which is currently not focused)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After (3), the focus ripple disappears from the slider.\r\n- In (4), you can normally click/drag the slider handle\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The slider's handle remains focused no matter what you do with the rest of the page.\r\n- The other handle of the slider does not react to click/drag.

When a formcontrol is used with a \"mat-radio-group\" it will always have the state \"touched\" when rendered on the server. When I want to show validation messages only for form controls that were actually touched this will result in a short flicker of the validation message when loading the page initially. The same problem also occurs for \"mat-slide-toggle\", but not for normal input fields.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nCannot include reproduction link, since this is requiring Angular universal and a node server.\r\n\r\nComponent\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'page',\r\n  templateUrl: './page.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./page.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class PageComponent extends BaseComponent {\r\n  protected formGroup = new FormGroup({\r\n    productKey: new FormControl<string | null>(null, Validators.required)\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML\r\n```\r\n<form [formGroup]=\"formGroup\">\r\n  <mat-radio-group formControlName=\"productKey\">\r\n    <mat-radio-button value=\"'A'\">1</mat-radio-button>\r\n  </mat-radio-group>\r\n  {{ formGroup.controls.productKey.touched }}\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n\"formGroup.controls.productKey.touched\" should never be \"true\" when the page is loaded.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n\"formGroup.controls.productKey.touched\" is\"true\" when the page is initially loaded from the server (Reloaded page, opened directly), then when the browser script is loaded it is set to false. This results in a short flicker, since the values are different. When the page is initially loaded by the browser (Through navigation) the value is false which is correct.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material:15.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27234","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-radio-group): FormControl is always touched on server side\" (#27234)"},{"Id":"1740221894","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-04T17:29:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27231","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 5.1","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the repo to TypeScript 5.1 to resolve the snapshot check failures.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27231","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to TypeScript 5.1\" (#27231)"},{"Id":"1739912902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-03T21:08:58","Actor":"exo-pla-net","Number":"27230","RawContent":null,"Title":"Material Tabs + No Template Caching => Broken Virtual Scroll","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nIf you attempt a ***cdkVirtualFor** with a **templateCacheSize: 0**, the Virtual Scroll will break when you include a **Material Tab** in the repeated element.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz ](https://stackblitz.com/edit/el4pji?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-template-cache-example.ts,src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-template-cache-example.html,src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-template-cache-example.css)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

However, our accessibility team is wary of asking users to change a default setting in NVDA for this.\r\nBased on that, internally we have proposed this may be an NVDA problem, but we were asked to start here since NVDA is so widely used.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ahmyck\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click into the date field\r\n2. Tab over to the dialog-open button\r\n3.

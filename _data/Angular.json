This issue specifically arises when using nested form groups with `formGroupName`.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Create an Angular component with a form using reactive forms.\n2. Import `ReactiveFormsModule` before `FormsModule` in the component.\n3. Define a nested form structure using `formGroupName` and `formControlName`.\n4. Attempt to bind the nested form group and control in the template.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe form should initialize without errors, and nested form controls should be accessible and functional.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nAn error is thrown: \"formControlName must be used with a parent formGroup directive.\" This error occurs due to the import order of `ReactiveFormsModule` and `FormsModule` when using nested form groups.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- The issue is specific to the import order and the use of nested form groups.\n- Reversing the import order (importing `FormsModule` before `ReactiveFormsModule`) resolves the issue.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, inject } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from \"@angular/forms\";\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-form',\n    standalone: true,\n    imports: [\n        ReactiveFormsModule,\n        FormsModule,\n    ],\n    template: `\n        <form [formGroup]=\"formGroup\">\n            <form formGroupName=\"fg\">\n                <input formControlName=\"i\">\n            </form>\n        </form>\n    `\n})\nexport default class FormComponent {\n    formBuilder = inject(FormBuilder);\n\n    formGroup: FormGroup;\n\n    constructor() {\n        this.formGroup = this.formBuilder.group({\n            fg: this.formBuilder.group({\n                i: ''\n            })\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 15.2.11\nNode: 20.15.1 (Unsupported)\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.5.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 15.2.10\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.11 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.11\n@angular/cdk                    15.2.9\n@angular/cli                    15.2.11\n@schematics/angular             15.2.11\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58177","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"formControlName must be used with a parent formGroup directive' when importing ReactiveFormsModule before FormsModule\" (#58177)"},{"Id":"2584849038","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T06:49:30","Actor":"rajeevmehta-dev","Number":"58184","RawContent":null,"Title":"Importing a module script failed.,STACK=undefined in production Dist.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am encountering an issue in my production build.

This allows messages to be a bit more durable to insignificant whitespace changes. For example, reformatting the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div i18n>Hello, {{ name }}!</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInto:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div i18n>Hello, {{\r\n  name\r\n}}!</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs a whitespace-only change which has no visible effect to translators. Therefore we trim whitespace before extracting messages and normalize it to a standard format (`{{name}}`).\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the functionality for ignoring placeholder expressions entirely (originally added as part of dab722f9c899d775bb886a1d5beb5970f79c4cd8). Ideally, we wouldn't take placeholders into account at all, since whether an expression is `{{foo}}` or `{{bar}}` is also irrelevant to the translator. However doing so causes some challenges with TC, so we can't go that far just yet (see http://b/367255149#comment10). Therefore this PR rolls back that particular feature and replaces it with this one which trims expression whitespace instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58176","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): trim expression whitespace when `preserveSignificantWhitespace === false`\" (#58176)"},{"Id":"2582346054","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T23:50:07","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"58174","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): clean up event contract once hydration is done","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we also clean up the event contract once the hydration is done, as this removes event listeners registered through the container manager, since listeners registered on the `document.body` are never removed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58174","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): clean up event contract once hydration is done\" (#58174)"},{"Id":"2582133965","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T20:27:25","Actor":"willemtoerien","Number":"58172","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animations not working for ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n# Current behavior\n\nAnimations won't work for components that has encapsulation set to ShadowDom.\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nAnimations should work regardless of the encapsulation.\n\nYou'll see that the animations won't work.

It also occurs sometimes during regular builds/`ng test`, especially when other concurrent jobs put load on the system.\r\n\r\nBy adding lots and lots of logging, I found the root cause, which is a race condition when the sass worker manages to call `findFileUrl` again in between `Atomics.store(..., 0, 1)` and `Atomics.notify(..., 0)` invocations - I left more details as a comment.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe race no longer causes failing builds. After being notified, the worker checks again that the signal is not set to 0, and waits for another `notify` if necessary, which will be the correct one.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nI verified that the second `Atomics.wait(..., 0, 0)` actually does something meaningful, by logging the return value. Under load, I observed two instances where the return value was `\"ok\"`, indicating that the signal was 0 at the time of the second `wait`, and the build would therefore have aborted without the change.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28630","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular/build): avoid race condition in sass importer\" (#28630)"},{"Id":"2586960056","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T20:48:16","Actor":"acohenOT","Number":"28629","RawContent":null,"Title":"npm ci command fails with version 18.2.8","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nother\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.2.7\n\n### Description\n\nUsing command `npm ci` on a clean Angualr 18.2.8 project, the command fails with an error.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.

`selector.unify()` and `@extend` combine selectors:\n\n    -   The relative order of pseudo-classes (like `:hover`) and pseudo-elements\n        (like `::before`) within each original selector is now preserved when\n        they're combined.\n\n    -   Pseudo selectors are now consistently placed at the end of the combined\n        selector, regardless of which selector they came from. Previously, this\n        reordering only applied to pseudo-selectors in the second selector.\n\n-   Tweak the color transformation matrices for OKLab and OKLCH to match the\n    newer, more accurate values in the CSS spec.\n\n-   Fix a slight inaccuracy case when converting to `srgb-linear` and\n    `display-p3`.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** `math.unit()` now wraps multiple denominator\n    units in parentheses. For example, `px/(em*em)` instead of `px/em*em`.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Use `@parcel/watcher` to watch the filesystem when running from JavaScript and\n    not using `--poll`. This should mitigate more frequent failures users have\n    been seeing since version 4.0.0 of Chokidar, our previous watching tool, was\n    released.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix `SassColor.interpolate()` to allow an undefined `options` parameter, as\n    the types indicate.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Properly pass missing color channel values to and from custom functions.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

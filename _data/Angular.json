The `babel` with the plugin is not very fast. I'd love to only run `esbuild` and drop the `babel` portion of the code.\r\n\r\nI see that `@angular/dev-infra-private/shared-scripts/angular-linker` is being used in the code internally. It looks like this code can be used to run in an `esbuild` environment.\r\n\r\nUnless I missed something, I don't see that the Angular project is providing a public `esbuild` version of the linker plugin to be able to convert all the code to Ivy compatible usage for Angular 13.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this should be possibly by looking at [this code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/devtools/tools/esbuild/esbuild-spec.config.mjs)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is a way that I have not found.

partial declarations","State":"open","Body":"In v14, the partial compilation output of components have changed in a way\r\nthat prevents older versions of Angular to compile the partial declarations\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we used to emit used directives/components in separate arrays called\r\n`components` and `directives`, and used pipes in a property called `pipes`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nTestComponent.ɵcmp = i0.ɵɵngDeclareComponent({\r\n  minVersion: \"12.0.0\",\r\n  version: \"13.3.0\",\r\n  type: TestComponent,\r\n  selector: \"ng-component\",\r\n  ngImport: i0,\r\n  template: ``,\r\n  isInline: true,\r\n  directives: [{ type: i1.SomeDir, selector: \"[some-dir]\" }],\r\n  components: [{ type: i1.SomeCmp, selector: \"some-cmp\" }],\r\n  pipes: { 'async': i2.AsyncPipe },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the `version` property indicates which exact compiler\r\nversion was used to compile the component, but the `minVersion` allows older\r\nversions of the compiler/Angular linker to \"link\" the partial declaration to\r\nits final AOT compilation output.\r\n\r\nIn v14, the used directives, components and pipes are now emitted together\r\ninto a single array under the `dependencies` property:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nTestComponent.ɵcmp = i0.ɵɵngDeclareComponent({\r\n  minVersion: \"12.0.0\",\r\n  version: \"13.3.0\",\r\n  type: TestComponent,\r\n  selector: \"ng-component\",\r\n  ngImport: i0,\r\n  template: ``,\r\n  isInline: true,\r\n  dependencies: [\r\n    { kind: \"directive\", type: i1.SomeDir, selector: \"[some-dir]\" },\r\n    { kind: \"component\", type: i1.SomeCmp, selector: \"some-cmp\" },\r\n    { kind: \"pipe\", type: i2.AsyncPipe },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change has been made in support of standalone components, but it does mean\r\nthat older compiler versions can no longer link these partial declarations\r\nas desirable as none of the components, directives and pipes would be included\r\nin the AOT-compiled code.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the `minVersion` property, we hint to older compiler versions that\r\nthey are not capable of processing the partial declaration. This allows reporting\r\nan error at compile time instead of resulting in runtime failures due to missing\r\ncomponents, directives and pipes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45782","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): increase minimum version of partial declarations\" (#45782)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1219584327","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-29T01:58:06","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23056","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove \"build\" requirement of \"test\" circleci job","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23056","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove \"build\" requirement of \"test\" circleci job\" (#23056)"},{"Id":"1219449790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T23:34:54","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23055","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update node to m1 compatible v16","State":"open","Body":"This sure would be nice :/\r\n\r\nnpm also updated to v7 due to: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3623 although that doesn't seem to fix it","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23055","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update node to m1 compatible v16\" (#23055)"},{"Id":"1219165441","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T19:17:07","Actor":"twerske","Number":"23054","RawContent":null,"Title":"schematic to add font inlining for a new font family","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request?

[`v14.0.0-next.15`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next15-2022-04-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.14...14.0.0-next.15)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   Adds new required class member that any implementors of the LocationStrategy will need to satisfy.\n    Location does not depend on PlatformLocation anymore.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Keyframes names are now prefixed with the component's \"scope name\".\n    For example, the following keyframes rule in a component definition,\n    whose \"scope name\" is host-my-cmp:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) foo { ... }\n\n    will become:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) host-my-cmp_foo { ... }\n\n    Any TypeScript/JavaScript code which relied on the names of keyframes rules\n    will no longer match.\n\n    The recommended solutions in this case are to either:\n\n    -   change the component's view encapsulation to the `None` or `ShadowDom`\n    -   define keyframes rules in global stylesheets (e.g styles.css)\n    -   define keyframes rules programmatically in code.\n\n##### router\n\n-   When a guard returns a `UrlTree`, the router would previously schedule\n    the redirect navigation within a `setTimeout`. This timeout is now removed,\n    which can result in test failures due to incorrectly written tests.\n    Tests which perform navigations should ensure that all timeouts are\n    flushed before making assertions. Tests should ensure they are capable\n    of handling all redirects from the original navigation.\n\n##### bazel\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [68597bb0ca](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/68597bb0ca958445655653a0a3cb206c01c7e0b3) | feat | speed up dev-turnaround by bundling types only when packaging ([#&#8203;45405](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45405)) |\n| [970a3b5c70](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/970a3b5c70fee29aa40945836ebeb464d75438e4) | fix | add this_is_bazel marker ([#&#8203;45728](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45728)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [31d7c3bd71](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/31d7c3bd71fdab3fef1b4615ecb8124fe6c165bd) | feat | add getState method to LocationStrategy interface ([#&#8203;45648](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45648)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4d6a1d6722](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4d6a1d672210219328b33f4f96210870563066ee) | fix | scope css keyframes in emulated view encapsulation ([#&#8203;42608](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/42608)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [5771b18a98](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5771b18a989c3c75d713ffb75cd7c047c63e4090) | feat | add the `bootstrapApplication` function ([#&#8203;45674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45674)) |\n| [5a10fc4f82](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5a10fc4f8287d448c88ce2f6c97c48307af34af1) | feat | implement standalone directives, components, and pipes ([#&#8203;45687](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45687)) |\n\n##### localize\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a50e2da64a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a50e2da64a4297d1bc994a267203c2097da2efaf) | fix | ensure transitively loaded compiler code is tree-shakable ([#&#8203;45405](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45405)) |\n\n##### router\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [dea8c86cd5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dea8c86cd57f8e1720634928805f9ea0ba8f0baa) | feat | add ariaCurrentWhenActive input to RouterLinkActive directive ([#&#8203;45167](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45167)) |\n| [4962a4a332](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4962a4a3324d5972f364d768b38b21a33fdb7d7c) | feat | Allow `loadChildren` to return a `Route` array ([#&#8203;45700](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45700)) |\n| [50004c143b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/50004c143ba9b1e041c7b30caf98f6582d3d26d4) | feat | Support lazy loading standalone components with `loadComponent` ([#&#8203;45705](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45705)) |\n| [7b367d9d90](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7b367d9d908e15222645a45e2ba133b9d9da76b7) | refactor | Remove unnecessary setTimeout in UrlTree redirects ([#&#8203;45735](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45735)) |\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\nAlex Rickabaugh, Andrew Kushnir, Andrew Scott, George Kalpakas, Joey Perrott, Michal Materowski, Paul Gschwendtner, Pawel Kozlowski, Sumit Arora and dario-piotrowicz\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components</summary>\n\n### [`v14.0.0-next.12`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next12-plastic-keyboard-2022-04-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/14.0.0-next.11...14.0.0-next.12)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### material\n\n-   `mat.define-dark-theme` no longer accepts `$primary`, `$accent` and `$warn`.\n    Pass a single config map instead.\n-   `mat.define-light-theme` no longer accepts `$primary`, `$accent` and `$warn`.\n    Pass a single config map instead.\n-   Custom Material themes should no longer access `primary`, `accent`, `warn`,\n    `is-dark`, `foreground` and `background` from the theme map, but instead use the actual `color`\n    configuration (`mat.get-color-config($theme)`).\n-   Passing a color configuration directly to a `-theme` mixin\n    is not supported.

Web Components embedded remotely won't know where to load from.","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [X] build\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nApologies for not following the format. Upon upgrading to Angular 13, we found out that deployUrl had been deprecated in favor of baseHref and / or APP_BASE_HREF. So part of our migration consisted in removing deployUrl in our Web Components SPA that is used by our affiliates to embed our Web Components into their web sites. We already had baseHref (in project.json) and APP_BASE_HREF (in AppModule) \r\n\r\nproject.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"configurations\": {\r\n  \"production\": {\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"https://elements.iko.travel/\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nproviders: [\r\n   {\r\n      provide: APP_BASE_HREF,\r\n      useValue: environment.baseHref,\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nenvironment.prod.ts \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  baseHref: 'https://elements.iko.travel/',\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ndefined alongside deployUrl so migration involved only removing deployUrl from ./apps/web-components/project.json (We use Nx).\r\n\r\nImmediately after a release to production, we were notified that our Web Components were no longer loading properly. We looked at one of the sites and could see it was trying to load our modules locally to the affiliate site.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nA page is hosted here: https://life.rocks/and/then/some. It contains one of our Web Components. Our WC would try to load assets from that same URL like so: \r\n`https://life.rocks/and/then/some/897.js`\r\n\r\nOnce we reverted back to deployUrl, everything worked as it should again. baseHref and APP_BASE_HREF had no effect on where libraries were loaded from.\r\n\r\nPlease make very sure before removing deployUrl that it does not cause this type of error to occur.\r\n\r\nWe could easily spin up this error in staging upon request but it would maybe be worth a quick look in your codebase to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnx report\r\n\r\n >  NX   Report complete - copy this into the issue template\r\n\r\n   Node : 16.14.2\r\n   OS   : darwin arm64\r\n   yarn : 1.22.18\r\n\r\n   Angular / CLI: 13.3.3\r\n   nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/angular : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/cypress : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/detox : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/devkit : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/express : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/jest : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/js : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/linter : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/nest : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/next : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/node : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-cloud : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-plugin : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react-native : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/schematics : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/storybook : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/web : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/workspace : 13.10.3\r\n   typescript : 4.6.3\r\n   rxjs : 7.5.5\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Community plugins:\r\n   \t @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome: 0.10.2\r\n   \t @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap: 12.0.2\r\n   \t @ngneat/transloco: 4.0.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/data: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/effects: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/entity: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/router-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store-devtools: 13.1.0\r\n   \t angular-calendar: 0.29.0\r\n   \t @compodoc/compodoc: 1.1.19\r\n   \t @jscutlery/semver: 2.22.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/schematics: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @storybook/angular: 6.4.22\r\n```\r\n\r\n🍺\r\nBjorn\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23033","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Do not deprecate deployUrl.

deps: [BackendService]\r\n};\r\n```\r\nWhich works well but requires providing the provider yourself in root which is not tree shakable\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n```ts\r\nconst token = new InjectionToken<A>('Token 2', {\r\n  providedIn: 'root',\r\n  factory: () => new A(inject(BackendService)),\r\n});\r\n```\r\nWhich requires manually newing with factory which isn't the best...\n\n###

In my opinion this would be a perfect match.\r\nAnd as you can see in #5689 there is a need for reactive `@Input`\r\n@mgechev closed this issue because it would mean more coupling to RxJS. (Which is totally understandable)\r\n\r\nNowadays both features (`@Input` and `Signal`) reside in @angular/core. So lets get that going\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImagine how cool this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, computed, SignalInput, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-demo-input-signal',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      Sum is {{sum()}}\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoInputSignalComponent {\r\n\r\n  @SignalInput()\r\n  num1 = signal<number>(0);\r\n  \r\n  @SignalInput()\r\n  num2 = signal<number>(0);\r\n\r\n\r\n  sum = computed(() => this.num1() + this.num2());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is a trivial example, but often times I need to do a calculation or backend-lookup using two `@Input` values. Yes it is possible to pass complex values to `@Input` but thats kinda ugly.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing Signals for `@Inputs` is currently very verbose:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, computed, Input, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-demo-input-signal',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      Sum is {{sum()}}\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoInputSignalComponent {\r\n\r\n  num1Signal = signal<number>(0);\r\n  num2Signal = signal<number>(0);\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set num1(value: number) {\r\n    this.num1Signal.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get num1(): number {\r\n    return this.num1Signal();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set num2(value: number) {\r\n    this.num2Signal.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get num2(): number {\r\n    return this.num2Signal();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sum = computed(() => this.num1Signal() + this.num2Signal());\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: Reactive @Inputs with signals\" (#50190)"},{"Id":"1699029522","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T11:53:06","Actor":"bagbag","Number":"50189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signals - interoperability with non-angular libraries","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI develop a library which is shared between server and client and does not depend on angular. I would like to use angulars signals in there.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to separate signals from the rest of angular (like preact does it), but I don't think that this will happen for various reasons, which was also stated in the RFC if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nSo my idea was to just copy the signals implementation, remove zone.js stuff in `effect()`, use `queueMicrotask()` instead of `ApplicationRef.tick()` as the scheduling. use that implementation for the server and the implementation in angular for the client. I actually did that to be able to use signals in angular v15 and it worked flawless (but of course without native support in templates).\r\n\r\nIn order for the signals created in the library code to work in angular and vice versa they must be created by angular.  My basic idea for that (not the actual code):\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as Angular from '@angular/core';\r\nimport * as ExtractedSignals from './extracted-signals';\r\n\r\nexport let signal: signalFn = throwNotConfigured as any;\r\nexport let computed: computedFn = throwNotConfigured as any;\r\n\r\nif (isAngular()) {\r\n  signal = Angular.signal; // @angular/core signal\r\n  computed = Angular.computed; // @angular/core computed\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  signal = ExtractedSignals.signal; // extracted signal\r\n  computed = ExtractedSignals.computed; // extracted computed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is to now import signal/computed etc. from that file and use that throughout the shared library and server code. When running in an angular app, it is technically the same (runtime behaviour) as if it was imported from `@angular/core`, but the types differ. When running outside an angular app it still works the same (except for effect scheduling) without depending on angular.\r\n\r\nThis seems to work well except for one part: types. The `SIGNAL` symbols from the two `Signal` types are obviously incompatible, as they are `unique symbol`s. So I can't pass signals from angular to the library and vice versa, even though they are identical at runtime.\r\n\r\nIs there someone with an idea on how to solve this without changes to angular?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to mark `[SIGNAL]` as optional. But this will probably have unwanted side-effects like allowing to pass plain functions to `Signal` parameters.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type Signal<T> = (() => T) & {\r\n    [SIGNAL]?: unknown;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to use an `interface` instead of a type to be able to use typescripts declaration merging.\r\nBoth `@angular/core` and the shared library export it this way (`SIGNAL` is not exported in the current version):\r\n```ts\r\nexport const SIGNAL: unique symbol;\r\n\r\nexport interface Signal<T> {\r\n  (): T;\r\n  [SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumer of angular and the shared library then merges them:\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module 'shared-library' {\r\n  interface Signal<T> {\r\n    [AngularCore.SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare module '@angular/core' {\r\n  interface Signal<T> {\r\n    [SharedLibrary.SIGNAL]: unknown;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA thought that just appeared while I wrote that:\r\nIt actually would be enough if angular exports the `SIGNAL` symbol. Then I could merge one way, so that the libary `Signal` also have that symbol. But this way the library code would lack that extra bit of type safety if used standalone.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nSome `any`s in the glue-code and implicit type coercion, either using functions or types when passing library signals to angular and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBut this is out of question for me, as it's a bad DX and may reduces type safety.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50189","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals -

To remove the need to have different proxy configuration files for the two servers, the entries will now be normalized to regular expressions when using the Vite server.

So `task-123` is actually `task123`:\r\n<img width=\"819\" alt=\"CleanShot 2023-05-08 at 13 48 53@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/905328/236816236-db3dccab-743d-43ba-b171-7d6309e49e1c.png\">\r\n\r\nSo what I'd like to do would be one of these:\r\n```\r\nng g c TodoItemTask-123\r\nng g c TodoItemTask123 --selector app-todo-item-task-123\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut both commands get rejected with `Selector \"app-todo-item-task-123\" is invalid`:\r\n<img width=\"602\" alt=\"CleanShot 2023-05-08 at 13 46 29@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/905328/236815815-b1191559-ad0e-4418-9776-83d27473df1a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like if `ng g c TodoItemTask-123` was allowed and generates files like:\r\n```\r\ntodo-item-task-123.component.ts\r\n              ^ having the dash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nRenaming all the files and updating the NgModule by hand afterwards.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25164","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"generators: allow dash `-` in selector before a number\" (#25164)"},{"Id":"1698618854","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-08T07:50:07","Actor":"kisamoto","Number":"25155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Jest test runner not compatible with test tables (`it.each(...`)","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile trying the experimental Jest test runner (by modifying `angular.json` as detailed in the [blog post](https://blog.angular.io/moving-angular-cli-to-jest-and-web-test-runner-ef85ef69ceca)), to write [Jest test tables](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout).\r\n\r\nFirst, Typescript complains that `.each` does not exist.

One comment [#16779 comment ](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16779#issuecomment-579183693) stated it was not meant for files outside of bundles.  If I'm not mistaken, styles are part of the bundle.\r\n\r\nThe problem: I'm using a styles package that I don't have control over.  It has a less variable for setting the base-href path for the assets.  \r\n- When I serve it up at `/`, everything is fine\r\n- When I serve it up at  `/some-path` I have to update this less variable to /some-path/assets\r\n\r\nNow I have different configurations when I'm running the app locally and when I'm deploying it at /some-path on a server and angular fileReplacements doesn't support this scenario.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to be able to replace any file at the src root level for different configurations.  This would allow me to have:\r\n\r\n- styles.base.less (all my imports and global styles)\r\n- styles.less (import styles.base.less and modify the less variable)\r\n- styles.local.less (import styles.base.less, no variable modification, use this to replace styles.less in local config)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n- Considered fileReplacement above ^\r\n- Considered putting a file in assets, but I believe .less is a preprocessor on css and it would only copy the file\r\n- Considered webpack.config.js but again it would just copy the file without doing the pre-processing\r\n- Considered running a script right before build.

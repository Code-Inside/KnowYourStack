This can cause code to be migrated incorrectly and doesn't handle cases like import aliases. I've switched it to use the existing tooling for detecting decorated classes.\r\n* The migration was trying to migrate directives, even though they don't support the `imports` field.\r\n* The migration was detecting `TestBed.configureTestingModule` calls using a raw string match which is very fragile and can be broken by the user's formatting.\r\n* There were syntax errors in the unit tests.\r\n* There were type checking errors in the unit tests, for example none of them were importing the Angular decorators that they were migrating.\r\n\r\nThere's more room for improvement, but this should resolve the most glaring issues without having to rewrite too much.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(migrations): resolve multiple structural issues with HttpClient migration\" (#55557)"},{"Id":"2264632079","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-26T16:31:52","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55553","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs cleanup.","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits. \r\n\r\nfixes angular#54227\r\nfixes angular#50943\r\nfixes angular#49566\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55553","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Docs cleanup.\" (#55553)"},{"Id":"2264556814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-26T16:29:41","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55550","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update app-shell to reflect actual content","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #55507\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55550","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update app-shell to reflect actual content\" (#55550)"},{"Id":"2265782293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-26T13:26:42","Actor":"rosostolato","Number":"55560","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone Component Exports","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow standalone components to export other components to be accessed from within.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app-tab-group',\r\n  exports: [TabComponent], // export `app-tab` to be accessed as a child of `app-tab-group`\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\nexport class TabGroupComponent { }\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app-my-component',\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent], // only import TabGroup and TabComponent will come along\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-tab-group>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 1</app-tab>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 2</app-tab>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 3</app-tab>\r\n    </app-tab-group>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, `TabGroupComponent` would act as a module and you won't need to import `TabComponent` every time you want to use them.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to create a module and export both components, but you will still be chained to ng modules.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.6`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next6-2024-04-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-next.5...18.0.0-next.6)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### animations\n\n-   Deprecated `matchesElement` method has been removed from `AnimationDriver` as it is unused.\n\n##### core\n\n-   `async` has been removed, use `waitForAsync` instead.\n\n##### http\n\n-   By default we now prevent caching of HTTP requests that require authorization . To opt-out from this behaviour use the `includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders` option in `withHttpTransferCache`.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```ts\n    withHttpTransferCache({\n      includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders: true,\n    })\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   Deprecated `StateKey`, `TransferState` and `makeStateKey` have been removed from `@angular/platform-browser`, use the same APIs from `@angular/core`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   `getCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleCurrencyCode`, `getLocaleCurrencyName`, `getLocaleCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleDateFormat`, `getLocaleDateTimeFormat`, `getLocaleDayNames`, `getLocaleDayPeriods`, `getLocaleDirection`, `getLocaleEraNames`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriodRules`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriods`, `getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek`, `getLocaleId`, `getLocaleMonthNames`, `getLocaleNumberFormat`, `getLocaleNumberSymbol`, `getLocalePluralCase`, `getLocaleTimeFormat`, `getLocaleWeekEndRange`, `getNumberOfCurrencyDigits`\n\n##### http\n\n-   `HttpClientModule`, `HttpClientXsrfModule` and `HttpClientJsonpModule`\n\n    As mentionned, those modules can be replaced by provider function only.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [bcce85af72](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bcce85af72a82634f60b31d66a5ef42ecd844ce8) | refactor | remove deprecated `matchesElement` from `AnimationDriver` ([#&#8203;55479](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55479)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d34c033902](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d34c033902b4e7543796de6c57d0cfd09093eb43) | refactor | Deprecate Local Data API functions ([#&#8203;54483](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54483)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7a16d7e969](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7a16d7e969eaf5a9475ffdd21a4bf637ce523856) | fix | don't type check the bodies of control flow nodes in basic mode ([#&#8203;55360](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55360)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a730f09ae9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a730f09ae9e729da79a3e0951e15e0139ef67713) | feat | Add a public API to establish events to be replayed and an attribute to mark an element with an event handler.

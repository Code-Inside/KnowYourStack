In order to fix this, the compiler has to run a transformer that converts this information into something like:\r\n```ts\r\nMyCmp.ctorParameters = () => [\r\n   { type: MyService }\r\n];\r\n```\r\nCf. https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3a60063a54d850c50ce962a8a39ce01cfee71398/packages/compiler-cli/src/transformers/downlevel_decorators_transform/downlevel_decorators_transform.ts\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that it slows down community initiatives of integrating Angular with other tools. e.g. Vite, Vitest, SWC...\r\nThis forces tools to hack their way through. For instance, jest-preset-angular downloads the internal CLI transformer: https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/blob/f24156ea1f7532c02c44d8d023b54623a4bccccd/scripts/prebuild.js#L9\r\n\r\n## `inject()` to the rescue\r\n\r\nThe good news is that an app using only `inject()` instead of constructor param types to retrieve dependencies will not need this transformer:\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n myService = inject(MyService);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with using `inject()` function this way is that it doesn't allow injecting dependencies manually. This means that all tests will need the `TestBed` or similar to control dependencies resolution.\r\nTo allow manual instantiation, the current alternative would be something **non-explicit, verbose and error-prone** like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n   // let's not do this\r\n  constructor(myService?: MyService) {\r\n    this.myService = myService ?? inject(MyService);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCompiler should bypass type-based dependency injection when a default value is set and the given type can't be resolved.\r\nThis would allow the following syntax which currently works if this transformer is disabled:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n  constructor(private myService = inject(MyService)) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the following advantages:\r\n- ✨ constructor parameters transformer is not needed anymore... so easier integration with existing tools\r\n- ✨ manual instantiation is still possible\r\n- ✨ all the benefits of `inject`: type-inference, consistent way of injecting class-based & injection-token based deps: `locale = inject(LOCALE_ID)`, controlling options (e.g. optional, self) through flags instead of decorators.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUse `inject()` and never instantiate manually.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47606","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow `inject()` usage as constructor parameter properties default\" (#47606)"},{"Id":"1393958513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-03T00:44:06","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"47604","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add a migration to remove `relativeLinkResolution` usages","State":"open","Body":"As of Angular v15, the deprecated `relativeLinkResolution` config option of the Router is removed.

The migration worked fine, but when I tried to use it, nothing seemed to work at all.\r\n\r\nI believe I have everything setup correctly as my IDE (WebStorm) is flagging things I expect, but `ng lint` says everything is fine which is not true. `ng lint --fix` also has zero impact.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nng lint and ng lint --fix should do what is expected.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\nI have been following the below threads on the subject\r\n- https://dev.to/eneajaho/configure-prettier-and-eslint-with-angular-526c\r\n- https://medium.com/acute-angular/migrating-angular-projects-from-tslint-to-eslint-and-prettier-cd87eea9ffcd#:~:text=TSLint%20has%20been%20deprecated%20for,support%20(VS%20Code)%20too.\r\n- https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24010","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng lint\" (#24010)"},{"Id":"1396291142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-04T16:45:30","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24008","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): remove `ngOnInit` from component template","State":"closed","Body":"This commit removes the `constructor` and `ngOnInit` as most of the users prefer to add this manually if needed.\r\n\r\nCloses #23678\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24008","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): remove `ngOnInit` from component template\" (#24008)"},{"Id":"1395949051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-04T15:28:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24002","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): drop support for Node.js versions older than 14.20","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nfeat(@angular/cli): drop support for Node.js versions older than 14.20\r\n    \r\nNode.js 14.20 and newer support generating UUID using the crypto module.

Previously the `*` was required to be at the end of the pattern. It lets you do something like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"exports\": {\n        \"./features/*\": \"./features/*.js\",\n        \"./features/*.js\": \"./features/*.js\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild now supports these types of patterns too.\n\n-   Fix subpath imports with Yarn PnP ([#&#8203;2545](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2545))\n\n    Node has a little-used feature called [subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) which are package-internal imports that start with `#` and that go through the `imports` map in `package.json`. Previously esbuild had a bug that caused esbuild to not handle these correctly in packages installed via Yarn's \"Plug'n'Play\" installation strategy. The problem was that subpath imports were being checked after Yarn PnP instead of before. This release reorders these checks, which should allow subpath imports to work in this case.\n\n-   Link from JS to CSS in the metafile ([#&#8203;1861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1861), [#&#8203;2565](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2565))\n\n    When you import CSS into a bundled JS file, esbuild creates a parallel CSS bundle next to your JS bundle. So if `app.ts` imports some CSS files and you bundle it, esbuild will give you `app.js` and `app.css`. You would then add both `<script src=\"app.js\"></script>` and `<link href=\"app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">` to your HTML to include everything in the page. This approach is more efficient than having esbuild insert additional JavaScript into `app.js` that downloads and includes `app.css` because it means the browser can download and parse both the CSS and the JS in parallel (and potentially apply the CSS before the JS has even finished downloading).\n\n    However, sometimes it's difficult to generate the `<link>` tag. One case is when you've added `[hash]` to the [entry names](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#entry-names) setting to include a content hash in the file name. Then the file name will look something like `app-GX7G2SBE.css` and may change across subsequent builds. You can tell esbuild to generate build metadata using the `metafile` API option but the metadata only tells you which generated JS bundle corresponds to a JS entry point (via the `entryPoint` property), not which file corresponds to the associated CSS bundle. Working around this was hacky and involved string manipulation.\n\n    This release adds the `cssBundle` property to the metafile to make this easier. It's present on the metadata for the generated JS bundle and points to the associated CSS bundle. So to generate the HTML tags for a given JS entry point, you first find the output file with the `entryPoint` you are looking for (and put that in a `<script>` tag), then check for the `cssBundle` property to find the associated CSS bundle (and put that in a `<link>` tag).\n\n    One thing to note is that there is deliberately no `jsBundle` property mapping the other way because it's not a 1:1 relationship. Two JS bundles can share the same CSS bundle in the case where the associated CSS bundles have the same name and content. In that case there would be no one value for a hypothetical `jsBundle` property to have.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.5`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0265-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0264v0265-2022-09-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.4...v0.26.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   update typescript definition file to contain `replaceAll()` ([#&#8203;224](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/224)) ([45a4921](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/45a49214ba244b906f4d20450debc8edcc06e2a8))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.17`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8417)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.16...8.4.17)\n\n-   Fixed `Node.before()` unexpected behavior (by Romain Menke).\n-   Added TOC to docs (by Mikhail Dedov).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I'm working on a project where feature is usually split into multiple directories, for example:\r\n\r\nprojects/libs/feature-name/\r\n- app\r\n- shared\r\n- model\r\n- store\r\n\r\nAfter migration when I try to create a library with a such scheme it is no longer possible, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n$ npx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model                                                                                                                                                                                           ‹ruby-2.6.6›\r\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \"/name\" must match pattern \"^(?:@[a-zA-Z0-9-*~][a-zA-Z0-9-*._~]*/)?[a-zA-Z0-9-~][a-zA-Z0-9-._~]*$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that there is a workaround that when we make a path alias to projects/libs/feature-name it will work, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx ng generate library @feature-alias/model                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this project its very inconvenient since we have 100 different features and we would need to alias almost each one of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```bash\r\n# create empty workspace\r\n ng new my-workspace --create-application false\r\n# in that workspace create a library with nested directories\r\ncd my-workspace/my-project\r\nnpx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path

Until we manually tab inside the panel. _Please see the attached video 1_.\r\n\r\n2) When the focus is inside the panel, on the first option and we swipe backwards (swipe to left), the focus goes to the last element on the page (last element on the footer of the host page). _Please see the attached video 2_.\r\n\r\nThough I only documented iOS here, the issue also exists on Android (tested with Pixel 2 + Android 11). In Android swiping in either direction, left  when on the first option and right when on the last option, will cause the focus to leave the panel and enter the content behind while the panel is still open.\r\n\r\nVideo 1:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13901527/193904148-52b7e842-25e5-44d6-835a-83aeaeecec7b.MOV\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo 2:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13901527/193904171-b5c59c89-8e8e-4c63-8bc2-b56db659f993.MOV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Use swipes, tab and double tab to interact with one of the mat-select controls and its options panel.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n1) With Voice Over turned on, On double tab of the mat-select control, after the drop down panel opens, the selected option or the first option must have being focused.\r\n\r\n2) With Voice Over turned on and dropdown panel open, while swaping backwards, the focus must not go into the background content.

It does work in a button, but buttons are not desirable within a form for my use case.\r\n\r\nSample Code:\r\n`<a id=\"testId\" tabindex=\"-1\" mat-icon-button>\r\n            <mat-icon svgIcon=\"Help\"></mat-icon>\r\n</a>\r\n`\r\n\r\nGenerated HTML in browser:\r\n`<a _ngcontent-wbb-c454=\"\" id=\"testId\" tabindex=\"0\" mat-icon-button=\"\" class=\"mat-focus-indicator mat-icon-button mat-button-base\" aria-disabled=\"false\"><span class=\"mat-button-wrapper\"><mat-icon _ngcontent-wbb-c454=\"\" role=\"img\" svgicon=\"Help\" class=\"mat-icon notranslate mat-icon-no-color\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ng-reflect-svg-icon=\"Help\" data-mat-icon-type=\"svg\" data-mat-icon-name=\"Help\"><svg id=\"iHelp\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 22 22\" fit=\"\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" focusable=\"false\"><defs><style> #iHelp .a{fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:2px;} </style></defs><g transform=\"translate(1 1)\"><circle class=\"a\" cx=\"10\" cy=\"10\" r=\"10\"></circle><path class=\"a\" d=\"M9.09,9a3,3,0,0,1,5.83,1c0,2-3,3-3,3\" transform=\"translate(-2 -2)\"></path><line class=\"a\" x2=\"0.01\" transform=\"translate(10 15)\"></line></g></svg></mat-icon></span><span matripple=\"\" class=\"mat-ripple mat-button-ripple mat-button-ripple-round\" ng-reflect-disabled=\"false\" ng-reflect-centered=\"true\" ng-reflect-trigger=\"\"></span><span class=\"mat-button-focus-overlay\"></span></a>`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

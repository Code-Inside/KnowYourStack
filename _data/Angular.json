I then use the loadTranslations() method to load the file.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that when I run ng extract-i18n, the computeDigest() function generates the message id. When the application starts, loadTranslations() calls computeMsgId(), which generates message id in the same format as that rendered to \"simple JSON\" translation files when extracting messages. However, in my case, the extract generates different ids for the same string in xliff2 vs JSON formats, which is causing the warnings. (Not for all strings, but for some).\r\n\r\nI have created a JSON object from xliff 2 extracted messages and compared it to the one extracted with JSON, and there were a couple of discrepancies: \r\n\r\n1.\r\nFor the next template:\r\n```html\r\n<p>text {{ test1 }}</p>\r\n<p>text {{ test2 }}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nxliff2 extractor produced two records, while json extractor created only one record\r\n\r\n2.\r\nxliff 2 generates a different id compared to JSON for the same string in some cases. I have around 300 differences out of approx. 4500 strings. I looked through closed problems and saw that there was a problem with mapping for xliff 1.2 and some legacy id migration, but I am working with Angular 14 and xliff 2 format so I hoped this shouldn't be a problem anymore...\r\n\r\nAt this stage I can only see 2 solutions to my problem:\r\n1. Using simple JSON format during extract, which is not ideal for the translation team as it doesn't have context implemented.\r\n2. Using custom ids, which I am trying to avoid as it would require another pass through the code base.\r\n\r\nCould someone please verify that at this stage there is nothing else that can be done?\r\nIt just seems odd that the ids are different... \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\ntemplate.html:15 No translation found for \"7324656422629038198\" (\" No results found yet. \").\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.5\r\nNode: 16.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.2.0 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------       \r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.4\r\n@angular/material               14.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48786","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"i18n: No translation found for \"id\"\" (#48786)"},{"Id":"1549924507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-19T20:49:53","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48785","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Use of $any() has no runtime incidence.","State":"open","Body":"Some users are woried about `$any()` as function calls are to be avoided in templates.

In it there is an `AppComponent` with the following code to log relevant info:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor(platformLocation: PlatformLocation, locationStrategy: LocationStrategy) {\r\n    console.log(\"platformLocation.href:\", platformLocation.href);\r\n    console.log(\"platformLocation.getBaseHrefFromDOM():\", platformLocation.getBaseHrefFromDOM());\r\n    console.log(\"platformLocation.pathname:\", platformLocation.pathname);\r\n    console.log(\"locationStrategy.path():\", locationStrategy.path());\r\n    console.log(\"locationStrategy.getBaseHref():\", locationStrategy.getBaseHref());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf in `AppModule` the RouterModule is imported as `RouterModule.forRoot([])` and I visit `localhost:4200/subfolder/` the following is logged in console:\r\n```\r\nplatformLocation.href: http://localhost:4200/subfolder/\r\nplatformLocation.getBaseHrefFromDOM(): /subfolder/\r\nplatformLocation.pathname: /subfolder/\r\nlocationStrategy.path(): /subfolder/\r\nlocationStrategy.getBaseHref(): /subfolder/\r\n```\r\nwhich is what is to be expected. However when RouterModule import is changed to `RouterModule.forRoot([], {useHash: true})` and the same URL is visited, the log is as follows:\r\n```\r\nplatformLocation.href: http://localhost:4200/subfolder/\r\nplatformLocation.getBaseHrefFromDOM(): /subfolder/\r\nplatformLocation.pathname: /subfolder/\r\nlocationStrategy.path(): <empty string>\r\nlocationStrategy.getBaseHref(): <empty string>\r\n```\r\nNotice that `locationStrategy.getBaseHref()` returns an empty string, when one would expect that it would be `/subfolder/, same as in previous case as the same base-url is configured\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 16.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular packages 15.1.1\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48783","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HashLocationStrategy returns empty string for LocationStrategy.getBasePath()\" (#48783)"},{"Id":"1549501770","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-19T20:16:14","Actor":"PetrJajtner","Number":"48779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug in ngClass klass property","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe setter of ngClass directive named klass accepts value of type string but transpiled code checks only `null` and not `undefined` on https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_class.ts line 77 (committed 5f21c6d on Dec 9, 2022).\r\n\r\n`this.initialClasses = value != null ? value.trim().split(WS_REGEXP) : EMPTY_ARRAY;`\r\n\r\nSome libraries (especially PrimeNG) sets the initial value to `undefined` and therefore the app is crashing.

overwritten:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/61e69c87e6b577f1c5a71fb5c39c3bd6125c4b91/packages/router/src/router.ts#L169-L171\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/61e69c87e6b577f1c5a71fb5c39c3bd6125c4b91/packages/router/src/router.ts#L977-L987\r\n\r\nFor the moment the best way is to use an own provide for the ROUTER_CONFIG injection token.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd new settings to Router config\r\n\r\n```\r\n provideRouter(APPLICATION_ROUTES, withRouterConfig({\r\n        errorHandler: (error: any) => console.error('Router Error Occured', error)\r\n    })),\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThere is non if you want to fluent API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48759","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"provideRouter: there is no option for

However, further refactoring will be possible as additional capabilities are added in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use esbuild 0.17 incremental API in esbuild builder\" (#24561)"},{"Id":"1537343962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-18T03:19:02","Actor":"Socolin","Number":"24562","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow ng serve to listen on unix socket","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nI'm working on multiple project and playing around with ports to avoid conflict, or being force to stop a project to start a new one is annoying, I would like to be able to start `ng serve` on an unix socket (Also [available on windows](https://batsov.com/articles/2022/01/20/unix-sockets-are-now-supported-on-windows))\r\nThis would allow me to dispatch through nginx to the expected project based on the domain name (I added domain in my `/etc/hosts` file)\r\n\r\nA nice things is that the ports are not an issue anymore, I only need nginx to listen on 80/443 and then I don't have to find a new unused port for each project.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAllow `--host` syntax like `unix:///var/run/angular-serve.sock`\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24562","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow ng serve to listen on unix socket\" (#24562)"},{"Id":"1533493856","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-17T18:20:09","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24554","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency minimatch to v6 - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [minimatch](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch) | devDependencies | major | [`5.1.2` -> `6.1.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/minimatch/5.1.2/6.1.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>isaacs/minimatch</summary>\n\n### [`v6.1.2`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.1.1...v6.1.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.1.1...v6.1.2)\n\n### [`v6.1.1`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.1.0...v6.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.1.0...v6.1.1)\n\n### [`v6.1.0`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.4...v6.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.4...v6.1.0)\n\n### [`v6.0.4`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.3...v6.0.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.3...v6.0.4)\n\n### [`v6.0.3`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.2...v6.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.2...v6.0.3)\n\n### [`v6.0.2`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.1...v6.0.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.1...v6.0.2)\n\n### [`v6.0.1`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)\n\n### [`v6.0.0`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.5...v6.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.5...v6.0.0)\n\n### [`v5.1.5`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.4...v5.1.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.4...v5.1.5)\n\n### [`v5.1.4`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.3...v5.1.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.3...v5.1.4)\n\n### [`v5.1.3`](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.2...v5.1.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/isaacs/minimatch/compare/v5.1.2...v5.1.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

belongs to.\r\n\r\nWhat it DOESN'T say is that if the column name has any symbols in it like dots or backslashes or anything that the [_setNameInput method in CdkColumnDef](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/623b0c94e90f83ba1a91d93137ebad6622e12bdd/src/cdk/table/cell.ts#L139) would consider not CSS friendly, the harness will instead return that column's name with all of the offending characters replaced with dashes\r\n\r\n**Example:** \r\n\r\nLet's say that I've defined row template as [per point 3 in MatTable's Getting Started](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview#3-define-the-row-templates) section, and one of the columns is called _\"bar.tar\"_\r\n\r\n`columnsToDisplay = ['foo', 'bar.tar'];`\r\n\r\nLater on I'm writing tests and using test harnesses to get a list of that table's columns\r\n\r\n```\r\n// cells is of type MatCellHarness[]\r\nconst columnNames = await parallel(() => cells.map(cell => cell.getColumnName()));\r\n// columnNames is ['foo', 'bar-tar']\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand, it's because the cell harness uses the [cell's own CSS class](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/31a754c90405ac3a21858cdd038d56aa7375fabc/src/material/table/testing/cell-harness.ts#L23) to deduct its column's name, which is fair enough, but I do strongly think that this behaviour should be documented\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation

The resulting background color is a light gray. This can make some label text colors more difficult to read than necessary including the default custom theme set up by the ng add setup script for @angular/material.\r\n\r\nOddly enough if I enable auto dark mode in Chrome's flags it decides to change this white background into a black one which looks much better (this is what initially sent me on this rabbit hole because I forgot it was on and doing things as it does).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mftvsq\r\n\r\nMaterial docs site has the same problem; focus either input field in the first example while using either of the provided dark themes:\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/input/overview\r\n\r\nI first reproduced using the command line tools:\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. ng new <project> (no routing)\r\n2. cd <project>\r\n3. ng add @angular/material (custom theme, enable animations)\r\n4. change the theme to dark mode in styles.scss.\r\n5. add mat input and mat form field modules to app.module.ts\r\n6. add a mat input to app.component which uses a mat-label.\r\n7. ng serve and check it out\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe label should remain readable while the input is focused.\r\n\r\nIMO the focus overlay for input/select/textarea should be less opaque white or should be black (\"surface\" color?) instead to avoid lowering contrast with text color. Not sure if light theme needs adjustment as well, I think it was more readable.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the label and underline should be white instead of primary color for maximum readability.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the material guidelines have to say about this if anything.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe text is difficult to read while the input is focused as the background becomes a light gray and the label color is primary.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 111.0.5532.2 and 108.0.5359.126\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):  Windows 11 22H2 and Windows 10 21H2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26441","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theming): dark theme input labels are hard to read with the built-in custom theme template\" (#26441)"},{"Id":"1535285878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-16T17:36:22","Actor":"maximumCallStackSizeExceeded","Number":"26440","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk-drag-drop, cdk-tree): FireFox (mouseenter) not working with cdkDrag","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n## Different behavior with cdkDrag and  (mouseenter) between Chrome and Firefox\r\n\r\n```\r\n        <cdk-nested-tree-node *cdkTreeNodeDef=\"let node\" \r\n                              (mouseenter)=\"onMouseEnter(node)\" (mouseleave)=\"onMouseLeave(node)\">\r\n            <div\r\n                    cdkDrag\r\n                    (cdkDragStarted)=\"dragStarted()\" (cdkDragEnded)=\"dragEnded()\"\r\n                    (cdkDragDropped)=\"dragDropped()\"\r\n                    (click)=\"selectEntity(node)\"\r\n            >\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chrome: (mouseenter) event is triggered successfully, after (cdkDragStarted)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122812012/212735599-6cd192e4-c6a1-4750-b038-36f1e03524a8.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Firefox: same logic fails\r\n\r\n\r\n![FireFox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122812012/212735793-b76e86e6-191f-4727-9394-ab3ac554394e.gif)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

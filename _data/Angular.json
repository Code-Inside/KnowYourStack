E.g. in one worker, it may be the actual `.ts` file inside the source tree, while in the other, the file may be inside `blaze-out`.\r\n\r\nTsurge currently expects project relative paths to be passed around. Those project relative paths are currently only based on the single root directory. Hence paths inside `blaze-out` would actually not be recognizable.\r\n\r\nThe fix idea here is that we always respect root directories when computing a project relative path. Think of the computed path as the unique path you'd also get when importing from your project root. You'd always get to the same file.\r\n\r\nThis is perfect for passing between workers, assuming those are the same project; but just sub-compilation units. The root dirs are expected to *match*. This is a fine assumption in 1P and 3P; and guaranteed.\r\n\r\nOne risk I could see is that later on, when we write replacements for such a relative path in 3P, it may be possible that the file actually resides in an actual root directory and not in\r\n`<primaryRoot>/<relative-path>`. We should probably try to safely get back to the absolute path when writing replacements.

(A hard reload with Ctrl-F5 does not help). Also, going into a private window seems to help.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I've never been able to reproduce this issue myself (the site is [BoardGamegGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)) but the reports are quite consistent, if not super frequent. It may be the case that some users run into this problem more than other users, but I can't say that for sure. The fact that cache clearing solves the issue seems to suggest that something about how Firefox is caching is causing it to cache some corrupt file, with cascading consequences, but that is purely conjecture on my part. \r\n\r\nThis may be related to angular/angular#44780, which we also reported, although note that that dates back to when Angular was using Webpack. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nIt is possible that you might run into this browsing the Angular portions of https://boardgamegeek.com\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\r\nNode: 18.20.4\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Intermittent module load errors in Firefox only\" (#28361)"},{"Id":"2511146966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-06T20:48:21","Actor":"tsteuwer-accesso","Number":"28365","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support where *browser* static assets (js,css,assets) are pulled from","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, we're running to a lot of \"Chunk loading errors\" when using CI/CD with Angular and Angular's SSR. The reason for this is because our CDN reaches out to origin to get static assets, which are served from SSR. As soon as a new build goes out, the CDN is cleared, and the new assets are now live.\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with people currently on the site as lazy-loaded chunks that are still wanting to be requested in the users browser will try to go back to origin, only for the CDN to find out they no longer exists because chunk file hashes changed, and trigger the \"Chunk loading errors\" we're constantly seeing.\r\n\r\nIn order for users to fix this, they must do a hard-refresh, something we do not want our users to have to go through, especially since we're an international company and at any point in time, we can have people millions of people on in any of our regions.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to configure where **browser** static assets are pulled. One solution we thought of is to be able to change the URL where browser assets are pulled from. Think of it like this:\r\n\r\n1.) Build 5000 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5000/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n2.) Build 5001 triggers. We somehow prefix in the CLI that **browser ** assets should be loaded from `https://my.cdn.com/5001/`. We then upload all the browser assets from the build to the `/5000` directory in our CDN.\r\n\r\nIf user was currently on 5000, the static assets from the `/5000` folder can still be loaded from our domain. If the user refreshes, and we had cleared our CDN, they would start getting `/5001` requests because the main html changed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, we're thinking about just doing a find and replace on any `./chunk` string in the output dist for `/browser` and doing this ourselves. I'm not sure if the Google team has ran into this, I'm sure they have, but I would also welcome any other solutions you guys come up with.

(Angular build time)\r\nthe Get completes and provides the index.html and starts loading the app resources.\r\n\r\nAs I write this up, I am starting to think that the error about not finding the file specified is a red herring.\r\nPerhaps there is a difference between the output from browser and browser-esbuild, and that whatever the SpaServices is looking for, that was written out from browser, is not being written out by browser-esbuild, so SpaServices is still waiting for something before it will proxy (or whatever) and return index.html (ie. still waiting for Angular to startup on localhost:4200)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nsee above\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/19.0.0-next.2...19.0.0-next.3)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### cdk\n\n-   -   Since `cdk.high-contrast` targets a media query instead of a class, the specificity of the styles it emits is lower than before.\n-   -   Virtual scrolling lists now have proper type checking which can reveal some previously-hidden compilation errors.\n\n    -   fix(cdk/scrolling): adds ngTemplateContextGuard\n    implements ngTemplateContextGuard for CdkVirtualForOf directive\n\n##### material\n\n-   -   `mixinColor` and `CanColor` have been removed. Use a host binding instead.\n    -   `mixinDisableRipple` and `CanDisableRipple` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinDisabled` and `CanDisable` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinInitialized` and `HasInitialized` have been removed. Use a `Subject` that emits in `ngOnInit` instead.\n    -   `mixinTabIndex` and `HasTabIndex` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n\n##### material\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [90eea1bf70](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/90eea1bf7084ea7098676ca9988624802f27884c) | fix | **core:** Allow system variables to be formatted for opacity ([#&#8203;29665](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29665)) |\n| [edce90652a](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/edce90652ade6715b4404db284f684b1b511fae4) | fix | **core:** delete deprecated APIs ([#&#8203;29651](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29651)) |\n| [4771931c2f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/4771931c2f334be1edc2b7764921d6539808317e) | fix | **core:** Fix incorrect color role mappings ([#&#8203;29655](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29655)) |\n| [9333de0537](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/9333de0537e7b905407999820bf283f4943c986b) | fix | **tooltip:** remove old IE workaround ([#&#8203;29674](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29674)) |\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [f4a02adb77](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/f4a02adb779968ab1e696aa93dc69b62e7a18929) | feat | **a11y:** use native media query for high contrast detection ([#&#8203;29678](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29678)) |\n| [5439460d1f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/5439460d1fe166f8ec34ab7d48f05e0dd7f6a946) | fix | **scrolling:** adds ngTemplateContextGuard ([#&#8203;27276](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/27276)) |\n\n##### multiple\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b3a9062edf](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/b3a9062edf8863250ddd462e5abe009fbc46243b) | fix | ripples not showing up in some cases ([#&#8203;29672](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/29672)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

`AngularNodeAppEngine` for handling pages static headers**\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new `getHeaders` method to the `AngularAppEngine` and `AngularNodeAppEngine` classes, designed to facilitate the retrieval of HTTP headers based on URL pathnames for statically generated (SSG) pages.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst angularAppEngine = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\r\n\r\napp.use(express.static('dist/browser', {\r\n  setHeaders: (res, path) => {\r\n    // Retrieve headers for the current request\r\n    const headers = angularAppEngine.getHeaders(res.req);\r\n\r\n    // Apply the retrieved headers to the response\r\n    for (const { key, value } of headers) {\r\n      res.setHeader(key, value);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `getHeaders` method is used within an Express application to dynamically set HTTP headers for static files. This ensures that appropriate headers are applied based on the specific request, enhancing the handling of SSG pages.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**feat(@angular/ssr): introduce `AngularNodeAppEngine` API for Node.js integration**\r\n\r\nExpose a variant of `AngularAppEngine` tailored for Node.js.

`meta.feature-exists` function is now deprecated. This deprecation is\n    named `feature-exists`.\n\n-   Fix a crash when using `@at-root` without any queries or children in the\n    indented syntax.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Backport the deprecation options (`fatalDeprecations`, `futureDeprecations`,\n    and `silenceDeprecations`) to the legacy JS API. The legacy JS API is itself\n    deprecated, and you should move off of it if possible, but this will allow\n    users of bundlers and other tools that are still using the legacy API to\n    still control deprecation warnings.\n\n-   Fix a bug where accessing `SourceSpan.url` would crash when a relative URL was\n    passed to the Sass API.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Explicitly expose a `sass` executable from the `sass-embedded` npm package.\n    This was intended to be included in 1.63.0, but due to the way\n    platform-specific dependency executables are installed it did not work as\n    intended. Now users can run `npx sass` for local installs or just `sass` when\n    `sass-embedded` is installed globally.\n\n-   Add linux-riscv64, linux-musl-riscv64, and android-riscv64 support for the\n    `sass-embedded` npm package.\n\n-   Fix an edge case where the Dart VM could hang when shutting down when requests\n    were in flight.\n\n-   Fix a race condition where the embedded host could fail to shut down if it was\n    closed around the same time a new compilation was started.\n\n-   Fix a bug where parse-time deprecation warnings could not be controlled by\n    the deprecation options in some circumstances.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n###

This configuration can lead to incorrect content being served, particularly in scenarios involving lazy-loaded modules or Angular routes with dots in their paths.\r\n\r\n### Current Problem:\r\n**1. Static File and SSR Route Handling:**\r\n\r\n* The server uses server.get('**', express.static(...)) and server.get('**', ...) for static files and SSR routes, respectively. This configuration causes every request to go through the static file middleware, including those intended for Angular SSR.\r\n* As a result, some routes can inadvertently serve the `index.html` file or other static assets, leading to incorrect `Content-Type` headers, especially for JavaScript files (e.g., lazy-loaded modules; the `main*.js` and `chunk*.js` files).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0f9744-2440-4f9f-986e-4e3f4b9afa6f)\r\n(I cant show the response, but it's the `index.html` content)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076e746-28cb-489f-ad5e-5e55291668ce)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Lack of Distinction Between Static Files and Angular Routes:**\r\n\r\nRequests that are intended to be handled by Angular’s SSR engine may be incorrectly intercepted by the static file middleware if the requested path contains dots or other file-like patterns. This can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect content delivery.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution:\r\n**1. Static Files Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '**',\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: 'index.html',\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '*.*', // This ensures only files with extensions are served by express.static\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: false, // Do not look for index.html in the browserDistFolder\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. SSR Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\n* Static assets should be served with correct Content-Type headers.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badccd98-83a0-4b3d-a26f-3223472ee1b8)\r\n\r\n* Angular routes should be correctly handled by SSR, regardless of whether they contain dots or other special characters.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n> Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

However, I’ve encountered an issue specifically in Firefox: when the context menu opens, the selected text is unexpectedly unselected.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, it appears that Firefox may automatically deselect text when focus shifts to elements outside the text container. While this behavior might be a limitation inherent to Firefox, I believe it is worth documenting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the official CDK context menu example includes mocked \"copy\" and \"cut\" options, which exacerbates this issue.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior something that can be addressed, or is it an inherent limitation of how Firefox handles text selection and focus?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: cf. https://material.angular.io/cdk/menu/examples\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2505485383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T14:08:36","Actor":"GiftLanga","Number":"29690","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …","State":"open","Body":"…input\r\n\r\nAdds the `updateNativeInput` field to the autocomplete trigger to update the native input element when the autocomplete is within a form field.\r\n\r\nFixes #29388.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …\" (#29690)"},{"Id":"2504966843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T10:42:16","Actor":"MaiGhoneim","Number":"29689","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n8.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nwhen enabling drag and drop in angular material table from columns headers for reoreder columns, cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" do not working in angular 18 \r\ni attached my code in the following link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. trying to drag any column header\r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nwhen dragging column header should be drag and drop only horizontail and in x direction\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ncolumn header drag and drop to everywhere\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table\" (#29689)"},{"Id":"2504621459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T08:14:12","Actor":"iFederx","Number":"29687","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): mat tab content not visible if tab is switched during animation of parent div","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you have a div animated that contains a mat-tab-group and you change tab during parent div's animation, the tab content will be invisible.\r\nLast version tested: angular 16.2.1.

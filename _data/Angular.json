In order to achieve that, it uses a server-side DOM implementation (currently [domino][1]).\r\n\r\nFor rendering on the server to work as closely as possible to running the app on the browser, we need to make DOM globals (such as `Element`, `HTMLElement`, etc.), which are normally provided by the browser, available as globals on the server as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `@angular/platform-server` achieves this by extending the `global` object with the DOM implementation provided by `domino`. This assignment happens in the [setDomTypes()][2] function, which is [called in a `PLATFORM_INITIALIZER`][3]. While this works in most cases, there are some scenarios where the DOM globals are needed sooner (i.e. before initializing the platform). See, for example, #24551 and #39950 for more details on such issues.\r\n\r\nThis commit provides a way to solve this problem by exposing an side-effect-ful entry-point (`@angular/platform-server/shims`), that shims the `global` object with DOM globals. People will be able to import this entry-point in their server-rendered apps before bootstrapping the app (for example, in their `main.server.ts` file).\r\n(See also [#39950 (comment)][4].)\r\n\r\nIn a future update, the [`universal` schematics][5] will include such an import by default in newly generated projects.\r\n\r\n##\r\nCloses #39950.\r\n\r\nRelated to angular/angular-cli#19869.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/domino\r\n[2]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/0fc8466f1be392917e0c/packages/platform-server/src/domino_adapter.ts#L17-L21\r\n[3]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/0fc8466f1be392917e0c/packages/platform-server/src/server.ts#L33\r\n[4]: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39950#issuecomment-747598403\r\n[5]: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/cc51432661eb4ab4b6a3/packages/schematics/angular/universal","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40559","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-server): allow shimming the global env sooner\" (#40559)"},{"Id":"792656188","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-25T17:09:09","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"40544","RawContent":null,"Title":"TEST - feat(platform-server): expose method for shimming global env","State":"closed","Body":"WIP","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40544","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"TEST - feat(platform-server): expose method for shimming global env\" (#40544)"},{"Id":"793559675","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-25T17:06:45","Actor":"saifabusaleh","Number":"40558","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Missing code sample in Basics of testing components","State":"open","Body":"# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGo to: https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-basics\r\nGo to By.css() section\r\nYou will see: `The code sample is missing for testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts#import-by`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/testing-components-basics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15147809/105738961-44198180-5f40-11eb-921a-2aa104df0ac7.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: Missing code sample in Basics of testing components\" (#40558)"},{"Id":"793541174","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-25T16:44:16","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"40557","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(zone.js): do not error when build `zone.js` on Windows","State":"open","Body":"In older versions of `bazelbuild/rules_nodejs`, the `npm_package.pack` rule does not work on Windows.

The first and the last work as expected; the middle one (where the `*ngFor` is over a calculated expression `displayedWords()`) does not.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect drag-and-drop in the middle drop-list to work in exactly the same as the first and the last one, changing the order of the words in all three lists.\r\n\r\nFailing that, I would at least expect to see a compile error here, or a warning on the JavaScript console, or (at a very minimum) clear and prominent warnings in [the documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) that drop-lists won't work if they are based on calculated expressions.\r\n\r\nSince the programmer has taken explicit responsibility (via a `cdkDropListDropped` function) for applying the appropriate update to the underlying data structure when list items are dragged and dropped, I don't see any reason in principle why this shouldn't work.\r\n\r\nIn the last drop-list, this is addressed by converting the list source into a member on the component. However, this requires the programmer to manually update that member whenever the underlying `words` array changes. This is inconvenient and error-prone, and undermines the automated data flow and change detection which is a key benefit of Angular.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe top and bottom drop-lists work as expected (items can be dragged and dropped, and this updates the underlying `words` array, causing the order of words in all three cards to change). However, dragging and dropping in the middle card has no effect whatsoever. It's as if it wasn't a `cdkDropList` at all.\r\n\r\nThere are no compile errors or warnings, or JavaScript console messages warning that something might be wrong. The intended drop-list just silently doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI don't see anything in [the documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) that states that this type of pattern should not work.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 11.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 11.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Reproduced on Firefox 84.0.2 on Ubuntu and Chrome 87.0.4280.141 on MacOS\r\n\r\n#### Possibly related issues\r\n\r\nThis issue may be the same as https://github.com/angular/components/issues/13340 - I'm not sure, as the wording of that issue is not clear to me.

configurable or not writable) the patched logic swallowed it\nand only console.log was produced. This behavior used to hide real errors,\nso the logic is now updated to trigger original errors (if any). One exception\nwhere the patch remains in place is <code>document.registerElement</code>\n(to allow smooth transition for code/polyfills that rely on old behavior in legacy browsers).\nIf your code relies on the old behavior (where errors were not thrown before),</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

It seems like the `--build` option is completely ignored. \r\nWe have a relatively big monorepo with a dozen projects/libraries in Angular and NestJS and we're utilizing `ngc --noEmit` as a tool to verify validity of typescript and templates as automatic check on our pull requests. However that seems to not pickup the `tsconfig` files of all the subprojects. No matter what I do it refuses to recognize cypress types in the e2e test files as it has its own tsconfig, but this same problem is present when simply  running `tsc --noEmit`.\r\n\r\nHowever typescript compiler also provides `references` and `--build` options which allow us to specify the project tree and make `tsc` build each subproject with its own config. This is very desirable but, alas, it seems like `ngc` does not support it.\r\n\r\nFor example for\r\n```\r\n  \"references\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"tsconfig.app.json\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n`tsc --build` provides this result:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15785773/200295966-a1931ca3-2665-40ce-a1e0-49055ce5daf7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.8\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.8\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47984","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ngc --build does not do anything\" (#47984)"},{"Id":"1438025897","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-07T09:17:21","Actor":"TheBlckbird","Number":"47983","RawContent":null,"Title":"Option to use AssemblyScript instead of TypeScript","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_I don’t know_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI don’t know if this is possible, but it would be pretty cool if you could compile into Webassembly instead of JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nhttps://www.assemblyscript.org/\r\nBut I don’t know if this is good enough to use\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWhat should I write here?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47983","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Option to use AssemblyScript instead of TypeScript\" (#47983)"},{"Id":"1437515978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-06T19:40:30","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"47982","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): avoid using `getMutableClone` API if targeting ES2015 and later","State":"open","Body":"Using default imports for DI types currently results in a printed deprecation message when using TypeScript 4.8 and later, as the compiler uses the deprecated `ts.getMutableClone` API to cause TypeScript to retain a default important that is only used in type-only locations.

This also allows for a workaround to a Zone.js/Node.js v18 problem where the TypeScript dynamic import workaround involving the Function constructor to ensure a native dynamic import expression will cause a failure when running on Node.js v18.10.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 484cda5f9ee90ab17807eb7f5cfb4a40ea6cd264)\r\n\r\n\r\nPatch version of https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24042 which is needed to address https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47872","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): isolate zone.js usage when rendering server bundles\" (#24192)"},{"Id":"1438704450","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-07T17:12:53","Actor":"clydin","Number":"24194","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): update sourcemaps when rebasing Sass url() functions in esbuild builder","State":"open","Body":"When using the experimental esbuild-based browser application builder with Sass and sourcemaps, the final sourcemap for an input Sass stylesheet will now contain the original content for any `url` functions that were rebased to support bundling.

This allows the bundler to locate and process any resource files such as images or fonts used within the stylesheet.\r\nThe implementation of the rebasing functionality uses a series of custom Sass importers to transform the input stylesheets (from import or use rules) when they are loaded from the file system. However, for the Sass compiler to use the load functionality of an importer, the `canonicalize` function (used to resolve an import) of the same importer must return a resolved path to the requested stylesheet. To support this requirement, all stylesheet resolution has been implemented in three new importers: relative, module, and load path. An additional benefit of these resolvers is that they have been implemented to minimize the volume of filesystem calls and also cache directory entry information (currently per request) to further reduce file system access. The reduction in filesystem calls provides a small performance benefit for projects containing a large amount of Sass file imports.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24185","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): rebase Sass url() values when using esbuild-based builder\" (#24185)"},{"Id":"1437931698","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-07T13:13:00","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24190","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It looks like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    const value = { foo: 1, bar: false } satisfies Record<string, number | boolean>\n    console.log(value.foo.toFixed(1)) // TypeScript knows that \"foo\" is a number here\n    ```\n\n    Before this existed, you could use a cast with `as` to check that a value satisfies a less specific type, but that removes any additional knowledge that TypeScript has about that specific value:\n\n    ```ts\n    const value = { foo: 1, bar: false } as Record<string, number | boolean>\n    console.log(value.foo.toFixed(1)) // TypeScript no longer knows that \"foo\" is a number\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about this feature in [TypeScript's blog post for 4.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9-rc/#the-satisfies-operator) as well as [the associated TypeScript issue for this feature](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/47920).\n\n    This feature was implemented in esbuild by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Fix watch mode constantly rebuilding if the parent directory is inaccessible ([#&#8203;2640](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2640))\n\n    Android is unusual in that it has an inaccessible directory in the path to the root, which esbuild was not originally built to handle. To handle cases like this, the path resolution layer in esbuild has a hack where it treats inaccessible directories as empty. However, esbuild's watch implementation currently triggers a rebuild if a directory previously encountered an error but the directory now exists. The assumption is that the previous error was caused by the directory not existing. Although that's usually the case, it's not the case for this particular parent directory on Android. Instead the error is that the directory previously existed but was inaccessible.\n\n    This discrepancy between esbuild's path resolution layer and its watch mode was causing watch mode to rebuild continuously on Android. With this release, esbuild's watch mode instead checks for an error status change in the `readdir` file system call, so watch mode should no longer rebuild continuously on Android.\n\n-   Apply a fix for a rare deadlock with the JavaScript API ([#&#8203;1842](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1842), [#&#8203;2485](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2485))\n\n    There have been reports of esbuild sometimes exiting with an \"all goroutines are asleep\" deadlock message from the Go language runtime. This issue hasn't made much progress until recently, where a possible cause was discovered (thanks to [@&#8203;jfirebaugh](https://togithub.com/jfirebaugh) for the investigation). This release contains a possible fix for that possible cause, so this deadlock may have been fixed. The fix cannot be easily verified because the deadlock is non-deterministic and rare. If this was indeed the cause, then this issue only affected the JavaScript API in situations where esbuild was already in the process of exiting.\n\n    In detail: The underlying cause is that Go's [`sync.WaitGroup`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#WaitGroup) API for waiting for a set of goroutines to finish is not fully thread-safe. Specifically it's not safe to call `Add()` concurrently with `Wait()` when the wait group counter is zero due to a data race. This situation could come up with esbuild's JavaScript API when the host JavaScript process closes the child process's stdin and the child process (with no active tasks) calls `Wait()` to check that there are no active tasks, at the same time as esbuild's watchdog timer calls `Add()` to add an active task (that pings the host to see if it's still there). The fix in this release is to avoid calling `Add()` once we learn that stdin has been closed but before we call `Wait()`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.27.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.27.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.26.0...v8.27.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`f14587c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f14587c42bb0fe6ec89529aede045a488083d6ee) feat: new `no-new-native-nonconstructor` rule ([#&#8203;16368](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16368)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n-   [`978799b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/978799bd5c76fecf4ce8f17d89ad6c9f436c3228) feat: add new rule `no-empty-static-block` ([#&#8203;16325](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16325)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n-   [`69216ee`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/69216ee69c7172e847b64e0e934b5121a34d0ea3) feat: no-empty suggest to add comment in empty BlockStatement ([#&#8203;16470](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16470)) (Nitin Kumar)\n-   [`319f0a5`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/319f0a5491598825bbd528c6d1fc12771056a74c) feat: use `context.languageOptions.ecmaVersion` in core rules ([#&#8203;16458](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16458)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`c3ce521`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/c3ce5212f672d95dde3465d7d3c4bf99ff665f8b) fix: Ensure unmatched glob patterns throw an error ([#&#8203;16462](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16462)) (Nicholas C.

The problem is that the naming is also used in the class names generated by `typography-hierarchy`. These changes aim to avoid breakages by:\r\n1. Introducing a `legacy-typography-hierarchy` mixin that keeps the old behavior.\r\n2. Migrating users to the legacy mixin in `ng update`.\r\n3. Migrating users to the new version in `ng generate`. \r\n4. Renaming all usages of the legacy classes in templates and Sass files to the new ones.\r\n\r\nIn the process of writing the migration for the legacy typography, I found an issue where as a side-effect of PostCSS's behavior to re-run processors whenever an AST is mutated, we were applying the same migrations multiple times. This hadn't shown up until now, because all the migrations are independent, but in the `typography-hierarchy` we have a case where some legacy and non-legacy classes are being swapped. This led to wrong output and was causing the integration tests to time out. I've resolved the issue by:\r\n1. Wrapping these conflicting classes in a special value so that they aren't migrated incorrectly on the first pass. The special value is removed at the end of the migration.\r\n2. Adding some code in the `StyleMigrator` to avoid processing the same AST node with the same migration more than once.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've also included a couple of additional commits to fix the typography demo in the dev app and to reorganize a few schematic tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25929","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle typography hierarchy in MDC migration\" (#25929)"},{"Id":"1434749549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-06T10:26:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25921","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): clean up map-get usages","State":"closed","Body":"The global `map-get` function is deprecated.

I've used this mechanism in the past, to create wrapper components around scrollable content, regardless of the concrete implementation.\r\n\r\nBut with #24394, the provider declaration of `CdkVirtualScrollViewport` changed and unless I'm missing something, is now broken: it expects a provider for `CdkVirtualScrollable`, which the factory claims can be null, but isn't declared as an optional dependency for the provider factory. At the same time, `CdkVirtualScrollable` isn't really the correct injection token: as far as I see, it's provided via a new `VIRTUAL_SCROLLABLE` token (as seen in the new `CdkVirtualScrollableElement` directive)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: CdkScrollable,\r\n      useFactory: (\r\n        virtualScrollable: CdkVirtualScrollable | null,\r\n        viewport: CdkVirtualScrollViewport,\r\n      ) => virtualScrollable || viewport,\r\n      deps: [CdkVirtualScrollable, CdkVirtualScrollViewport],\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nexport class CdkVirtualScrollViewport extends CdkVirtualScrollable implements OnInit, OnDestroy\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the dependency for the provider factory needs to be changed to \r\n```\r\ndeps: [[new Optional(), new Inject(VIRTUAL_SCROLLABLE)], CdkVirtualScrollViewport],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-3hbcp2?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n2.

This is problematic for a few reasons:\r\n* It makes refactoring hard, because there are circular dependencies. (For example, `FormGroup` extends `AbstractControl`, and `AbstractControl.parent` is `FormGroup|FormArray`, so the classes are permanently coupled together.)\r\n* The code is less tree-shakable, because forms classes refer \"down the tree\". If you want `AbstractControl`, you get the symbols for its descendants as well.\r\n* There are several places where `AbstractControl` accepts `FormGroup|FormArray`, which is non-extensible. Abstracting this away will allow better support for custom `AbstractControl` implementations.\r\n\r\nIn this change, I add a new abstract class to the hierarchy. `AbstractControlCollection` is an `AbstractControl` that contains other form controls inside, and `FormArray` and `FormGroup` extend this new class.

Ideally, this should be included as a note in the documentation, for instance a comment in the Usage notes section would be useful.\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Now it only accepts `Observable<Tree>`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/37a06a7c37f5b4286d58b475e6e12c86f00fac5b/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/engine/interface.ts#L234-L237\r\n\r\nThe current problem with `Rule` accepting only `Observable<Tree>` it that it accepts only the `Observable` from rxjs of a fixed version `6.6.7` (at the moment of writing) which is hardcoded in `dependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics`:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c2737dd51ab68a538a317fc0d7a377032d346b53/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/package.json#L20\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I'm writing custom schematics in my repo, while having any slightly different version of `rxjs` installed, e.g. `6.6.3`, then I get an error about incompatible variants of the interface `Subscriber` - between my installed version in `node_modules` and the fixed version from `node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs` (which is derived from the interface `Rule`)\r\n\r\nExample of custom schematics for minimal reproduction:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Rule, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\nimport { of } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nexport function migrate(): Rule {\r\n  return (tree: Tree) => {\r\n    return of(tree);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message in detail:\r\n```\r\n(parameter) _context: SchematicContext\r\nType '(tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'Rule'.\r\n  Type 'Observable<Tree>' is not assignable to type 'void | Rule | Tree | Observable<Tree> | Promise<void | Rule>'.\r\n    Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable\").Observable<import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/tree/interface\").Tree>'.\r\n      The types of 'source.operator.call' are incompatible between these types.\r\n        Type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic' is not assignable to type '(subscriber: import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>, source: any) => import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/types\").TeardownLogic'.\r\n          Types of parameters 'subscriber' and 'subscriber' are incompatible.\r\n            Type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>' is not assignable to type 'import(\"/Users/krzysztof/code/develop-ng13/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Subscriber\").Subscriber<any>'.\r\n              Property 'isStopped' is protected but type 'Subscriber<T>' is not a class derived from 'Subscriber<T>'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- expose `Promise<Tree>` as a return type of `Rule`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- workaround on my side: return `Promise<Rule | void>` instead of `Promise<Tree>`\r\n- workaround on Angular's side: move `rxjs` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in `package.json` of `@angular-devkit/schematics` and relax the version to `^6.6.0` (but still.. what if somebody is using rxjs7 in their repo?)\r\n- I'm opened to your other suggested ideas or workarounds","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22783","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`Rule` from `@angular-devkit/schematics` should accept return type `Promise<Tree>`\" (#22783)"},{"Id":"1153249501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T14:11:21","Actor":"eng-dibo","Number":"22776","RawContent":null,"Title":"[@angular-devkit/build-angular] Cannot convert undefined or null to object","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

(even if my package.json requires v^7.4.0)\r\n\r\nthis makes the following line typely wrong if used inside an angular project (probably you may need to use a function or extend a class that uses rxjs.Observable from v7.4.0, but your root node_modules has rxjs v6.6.7)\r\n```\r\nimport { Observable} from 'rxjs';\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservable from both versions (i.e 6.6.7 and 7.4.0) are not compatible because there are many [breaking changes](https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary) between those versions, for example, `_isScalar` is removed from Observable at v7.0.0\r\n\r\n> the property _isScalar is missing in Observable\r\n\r\nthis specially happens in monorepos, where the angular project is a workspace inside that monorepo and there is another workspace that extends its functionality.\r\nin this case, the package managers may choose to install rxjs@6.6.7 in the root dir, and rxjs@7.4.0 inside the package's node_module dir.\r\n\r\n**my suggestion** is to update dependencies in @angular-devkit packages to remove that breaking changes between rxjs versions\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Ex. using `—-sourceMap` instead of `—-source-map` will result in an error. \r\n- `ng update`, `—-migrate-only` option no longer accepts a string of migration name, instead use `-—migrate-only -—name <migration-name>`.\r\n- `-—help json` help has been removed.\r\n\r\nCloses #20976, closes #16614 and closes #16241\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPending tasks that will be addressed in seperate PRs.\r\n- Replace parser in Schematics and Architect CLI.\r\n- Remove left over usages of old `Command` and `SchematicCommand`.\r\n- Validate changes in AIO docs generation.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): replace command line arguments parser \" (#22778)"},{"Id":"1150603196","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-25T18:35:15","Actor":"clydin","Number":"22774","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove unneeded JsonObject type casting","State":"closed","Body":"The use of the `@angular-devkit/core` `JsonObject` type is no longer needed to satisfy the type requirements of `@angular-devkit/architect` package builder creation functions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22774","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove unneeded JsonObject type casting\" (#22774)"},{"Id":"1150614728","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-25T16:41:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"22775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): remove unused `INITIAL_COMMIT_MESSAGE` text file","State":"closed","Body":"This file is no longer used.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): remove unused `INITIAL_COMMIT_MESSAGE` text file\" (#22775)"},{"Id":"1150306401","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-25T16:40:43","Actor":"nathan30","Number":"22772","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 13 - ng build-watch inifinity loop","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

This is the compiled result:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n[_ngcontent-uly-c97]:is(.foo) {}\r\n[_ngcontent-uly-c97]:is(.foo, .bar[_ngcontent-uly-c97], .baz)[_ngcontent-uly-c97] {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Example 2\r\n\r\nWhen used before or after `:host`, the number of items *inside* of `:is` unexpectedly affects the presence of an  `[_ngcontent]` qualifier *outside* of `:is`. The qualifier is missing for 1 item, but added for >1 item. This component CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:is(.foo) :host {}\r\n:is(.foo, .bar) :host {}\r\n\r\n:host :is(.foo)  {}\r\n:host :is(.foo, .bar)  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiles to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:is(.foo)   [_nghost-kfp-c134] {}\r\n[_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo, .bar)   [_nghost-kfp-c134] {}\r\n\r\n[_nghost-kfp-c134]   [_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo)  {}\r\n[_nghost-kfp-c134]   [_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo, .bar)[_ngcontent-kfp-c134]  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yc96o6?file=src/app/app.component.css demonstrates a live reproduction of this issue.\r\n\r\nFor my specific use case, I had a selector that looked like`:is(a, b, c) :host`. I was able to work around the problem by rewriting it to either of `:host-context(a, b, c) :host` or `a :host, b :host, c :host` (both compile to the same output). But in general, using `:is` and `:where` seems either unsupported or broken. If it's unsupported, I think it would be helpful if the compiler threw an error because the current behavior is hard to predict and does not seem useful.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yc96o6?file=src/app/app.component.css\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nI'm not using `ng`, so I can't provide `ng version` output.

jest tests to be run with `ng test`. The problem is that in zone.js there is a line of code that breaks most of the tests. On line https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/zone.js/lib/jest/jest.ts#L78:\r\n`return proxyZone.run(testBody, null, arguments as any);`\r\nthe test context is lost by passing `null` instead of `this`. In other places in the same file `this` is kept but on this line `null` is passed instead. Changing the mentioned line to:\r\n`return proxyZone.run(testBody, this, arguments);`\r\nfixes all tests.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '$injector')\r\n\r\n      at Function.Object.<anonymous>.module.$$cleanup (node_modules/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js:3279:32)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous>.module.$$afterEach (node_modules/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js:3274:14)\r\n      at ZoneDelegate.Object.<anonymous>.ZoneDelegate.invoke (node_modules/zone.js/bundles/zone-testing-bundle.umd.js:407:30)\r\n      at ProxyZoneSpec.Object.<anonymous>.ProxyZoneSpec.onInvoke (node_modules/zone.js/bundles/zone-testing-bundle.umd.js:3765:43)\r\n      at ZoneDelegate.Object.<anonymous>.ZoneDelegate.invoke (node_modules/zone.js/bundles/zone-testing-bundle.umd.js:406:56)\r\n      at Zone.Object.<anonymous>.Zone.run (node_modules/zone.js/bundles/zone-testing-bundle.umd.js:167:47)\r\n      at Object.wrappedFunc (node_modules/zone.js/bundles/zone-testing-bundle.umd.js:4250:34)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 12.2.15\r\nNode: 16.14.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.15\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1202.15\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.2.15\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.2.15\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.2.15\r\n@angular/cdk                    12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular             12.2.15\r\ntypescript                      4.2.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45675","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"zone.js breaks jest tests\" (#45675)"},{"Id":"1207608547","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-19T01:26:57","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"45674","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add `bootstrapApplication` function","State":"open","Body":"Note: this is a draft as it relies on some missing functionality (such as a standalone injector service and other standalone components public API).\r\n\r\nThis commit implements the `bootstrapApplication` function that allows bootstrapping an application and pass a standalone component as a root component.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45674","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): add `bootstrapApplication` function\" (#45674)"},{"Id":"1206875571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-18T21:10:23","Actor":"kaznovac","Number":"45666","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(router): fix mdn links in router guide","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The `aotSummaries` fields were completely unused, so you can just drop them from the TestBed APIs usage.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [598b759d33](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/598b759d33221cc2bbfad4895ca0d2499a0547f8) | fix | avoid errors with extremely long instruction chains ([#&#8203;45574](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45574)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [9add714b13](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9add714b13740db621eb2b200d72be74cc7eb630) | refactor | remove deprecated `aotSummaries` fields in TestBed config ([#&#8203;45487](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45487)) |\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\n4javier, Andrew Kushnir, Andrew Scott, Dylan Hunn, Jason Hendee, Jessica Janiuk, Kristiyan Kostadinov, Michael-Doner, Michal Materowski and Virginia Dooley\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v14.0.0-next.12`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next12-2022-04-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.11...14.0.0-next.12)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### forms\n\n-   Forms classes accept a generic.\n\n    Forms model classes now accept a generic type parameter.

Folks have to run `ng e2e` to see the supported testing frameworks and after that run `ng add [solution]`. Alternatively, for linting they have to run `ng lint` to get ESLint installed, but none of the tools comes by default.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo better inform developers about the integrations we provide, we can update our setup experience. When folks create a new project we can show two prompts:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Which end-to-end testing framework you want to use:\r\n  - Cypress\r\n  - Nightwatch\r\n  - WebDriver\r\n  - None\r\n- Do you want ESLint? (Y/n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf folks select `None` and `n` they should still be able to add e2e/linting to their projects with `ng add [schematics]`.

 return MatTable;\r\n    }(table.CdkTable));\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems like something is broken with the handling of the ... operator?\r\n\r\nThe ES6 equivalent code is:\r\n/**\r\n * Wrapper for the CdkTable with Material design styles.\r\n */\r\nclass MatTable extends CdkTable {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super(...arguments);\r\n        /** Overrides the sticky CSS class set by the `CdkTable`.

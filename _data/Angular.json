There are many tickets directly or indirectly touching the point (for example I opened one in the past https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55027 related to ngOnChange). \r\n\r\nThe thing is: there's nothing currently missing in terms of functionalities, but I believe the current way of implementing some patterns requires effects in a particular shape. And IMHO this opens up the opportunity to provide a standard solution at framework level and update the \"scary\" doc on the effect usage 😅. \r\n\r\n## Pattern example\r\nHere is a very common case: I'd like to create a service powered by signals where any time some parameters change, there's a new fetch of items. The implementation should take advantage of the reactive pattern.\r\n\r\nThis is a common request easily implementable with observables. Here is a possible version with signals: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-lt4skr\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nLet's focus on the important part of the code from the stackbliz: \r\n```typescript\r\n    \r\n  // service prop\r\n  //\r\n  // 1) I need a reactive condition: wants to track only param changes\r\n  //\r\n  // 2) when params changes, I want to fetch data and\r\n  // signal.write items. At the same time I don't want\r\n  // to have other signals.read causing potential problems\r\n  // (not interested in anything else than params).\r\n  //\r\n  // 3) effects are always executed once: but I actually\r\n  // don't want to fetch data based on the initial value\r\n  // of params... only when updateParams is called.\r\n  // So, I need a check in order to skip\r\n  // the first execution.\r\n  //\r\n  private paramsDidChange = effect(() => {\r\n    this.params();\r\n\r\n    untracked(() => {\r\n      if (!this.skipCallback) {\r\n        this.loading.set(true);\r\n        this.fetchItems(this.params())\r\n          .then((items) => this.items.set(items))\r\n          .catch((err) => this.error.set(err))\r\n          .finally(() => this.loading.set(false));\r\n      }\r\n      this.skipCallback = false;\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // consumers of the service call this public method\r\n  // triggers the reactive chain\r\n  //\r\n  updateParams(params: { textSearch: string }): void {\r\n    this.params.set({ textSearch: params.textSearch });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nOr in few words (there might be slightly different alternatives): \r\n```typescript\r\n  private paramsDidChange = effect(() => {\r\n    \r\n    // reactive condition to track\r\n    this.params();\r\n\r\n    // can signal.write and signal.read without issues\r\n    untracked(() => {\r\n      // skip the first effect iteration\r\n      if (!this.skipCallback) {\r\n\r\n        // signal.write has the same risks of creating loops like with obs\r\n      }\r\n      this.skipCallback = false;\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n```\r\nIMHO this code is kind of unavoidable and not straightforward to address developer needs. \r\n\r\n## Proposal: introduce a dedicated watch func\r\nWith a dedicated watch func, the code above could be better written like this: \r\n```typescript\r\n// params is the only condition to track\r\nprivate paramsDidChange = watch(this.params(), () => {\r\n  // can signal.write and signal.read without issues\r\n\r\n  // lazy execution\r\n  // by default, the callback is not immediately executed\r\n  // a dedicated flag can toggle the behaviour \r\n});\r\n```\r\nNow, you might argue that the effect-pattern above is not really used. But I kind of disagree with this statement: it's just hidden down the chain of code. Some examples: \r\n\r\n- angular [toObservable](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/rxjs-interop/src/to_observable.ts), \r\n- ngrx-signal-store [rxMethodFn](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/main/modules/signals/rxjs-interop/src/rx-method.ts)\r\n\r\nThis is also a common pattern proposed by [vue.js: watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers.html). In general, I frankly don't know how I could solve the very common problem above without using it. \r\n\r\nIMHO the usage of effects cannot be rare (as stated by the doc) because of the missing watch func. And the current usage is not ideal. \r\n\r\nFinally: thanks a lot for the amazing work you're doing! Angular rocks more than ever before and it's a pleasure to work with it. Bravi! \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a watch (or equivalent) func targeting the common pattern\r\n```typescript\r\n  private paramsDidChange = effect(() => {\r\n    \r\n    // reactive condition to track\r\n    this.params();\r\n\r\n    // can signal.write and signal.read without issues\r\n    untracked(() => {\r\n      // skip the first effect iteration\r\n      if (!this.skipCallback) {\r\n\r\n        // signal.write has the same risks of creating loops like with obs\r\n      }\r\n      this.skipCallback = false;\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep using effect","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55592","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(signal_effect with explicit deps): introduce a new \"watch\" func having explicit signal_deps and skipFirstCallback\" (#55592)"},{"Id":"2271371590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-30T12:41:05","Actor":"Joozty","Number":"55590","RawContent":null,"Title":"PromiseRejectionEvent not fired","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nzone.js\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe PromiseRejectionEvent is not triggered when zone.js is included on the webpage.

Attribute - no change watching but no binding too. Limited to only compile time strings.\r\n2. Input - signal based and can change over time.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing is the in between. A way to pass an input but without change watching.\r\n\r\nThe idea came from inputs I can't or don't want to handle when they change. Currently using ngOnChanges first change check I throw an error if it gets changed after first time.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA way to declare on time input. Something like:\r\n`a = input.oneTime<string>()` and will be just a string. If changed after first time will throw an error.\r\nIt will also make performance better (I think?) as no need for signal or tracking.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCheck in ngOnChanges for first change and throw error.

previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo setup using npm workspaces, with `/app` containing the Angular application and `/common` containing some common classes, interfaces etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Angular app, in the `tsconfig` I have common set up as a project reference, and this is then made accessible within my angular code by a typical module reference (`@myorg/common`).\r\n\r\nWhen serving my app, I have typescript set up to watch any changes in the `/common` folder and rebuild, and before switching to the new Vite-based dev server this all worked fine: when doing an `ng serve`, then modifying a class in common, the app would be reloaded with the latest code.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the new server, because Vite caches node modules in `.angular/cache/v17.2.0/vite/deps`, and only refreshes it on package-lock changes, its caching my symlinked common module, and then ignoring any changes I make. Not only does this mean is not live reloading, but on subsequent runs, unless I modify the package lock or remove the cache, it will use a stale version of my common module.\r\n\r\nIn a pure Vite scenario, this would be resolved by adding a `vite.config.ts` file like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default {\r\n  optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@myorg/common'] }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've read several threads where modifying the Vite config doesn't seem to be possible or on the roadmap for the dev server, so I'm not sure how else I'm supposed to resolve this without disabling the cache entirely through `angular.json`, which removes a lot of the performance benefits. Appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create top-level npm workspace `package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"repro\",\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"app\",\r\n    \"common\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. `mkdir app && mkdir common`\r\n3. Create a basic typescript library in `common` with a `package.json` and a basic class\r\n4. `cd app && ng new`\r\n5. Modify tsconfig to have project reference to common:\r\n```json\r\n\"references\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"../common\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n6. Import the library class in the app component and use it\r\n7. Within `/common`, run `tsc -w` in one shell and keep running\r\n8. Within `/app`, run `ng serve`\r\n9. Modify the class in `common`. tsc will rebuild but angular dev server will not reload\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.0\r\nNode: 20.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.1\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                    17.2.0\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@angular/google-maps            17.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27552","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite dev server with npm workspaces not reloading on project reference update\" (#27552)"},{"Id":"2266844538","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-27T05:10:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27551","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ba1c7fd` -> `041c977` |\n| [@angular/bazel](https://togithub.com/angular/bazel-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `62b2173` -> `516236a` |\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `44162cc` -> `276558e` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `42ff402` -> `ae0ec04` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `366fecf` -> `6109755` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `de31ef5` -> `8975877` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `3e3f974` -> `029ab16` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `1a89fdc` -> `524e2b9` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `baa47ac` -> `5783931` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `246c24c` -> `92ae685` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d8a60fa` -> `2973735` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c8a7ef9` -> `b7efcc9` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4e852f6` -> `6ac7054` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `da08acd` -> `55139d2` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b062feb` -> `aa55cb9` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `99a5149` -> `19cbb43` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b3ab491` -> `a22c896` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c82d952` -> `730c25f` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2248667` -> `1c9c329` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f82e2c4` -> `6e8f46d` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I would like to have an option `infiniteScroll` or another, with a better name, which when set, would emit the next page or previous page events until the data-source returns an empty set, thus letting the user know that they have reached the end of the dataset. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThe total count of a table is normally found by counting all rows in relational dbs like PostgreSQL\r\n \r\n> [However both both forms of count(1) and count(*) are fundamentally slow. PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure consistency between simultaneous transactions. This means each transaction may see different rows -- and different numbers of rows -- in a table. There is no single universal row count that the database could cache, so it must scan through all rows counting how many are visible. Performance for an exact count grows linearly with table size.](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/12/count-performance/#dup_counts_exact)\r\n\r\nMoreover, the resulting count is even slower when filters are applied. Filters are the expected part of any data table. \r\n\r\nWith an infinite scroll option, the user can keep firing the next page event without having to bog down the db with an expensive count query at the start.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28978","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(paginator): Paginator option where total length of the dataset of unknown\" (#28978)"},{"Id":"2267411417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T17:57:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28975","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): export all available M3 palettes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `$spring-green-palette` wasn't being exported.\r\n\r\nFixes #28924.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28975","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): export all available M3 palettes\" (#28975)"},{"Id":"2268890081","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T12:17:49","Actor":"monacodelisa","Number":"28977","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(slide-toggle): Customized slide toggle for theming featuring light / dark mode icon","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nThe feature I am suggesting is to add and additional slide-toggle button option\r\nthat is already customized for theme switching control.\r\n\r\n- having integrated theme appropriate icons within the `mdc-switch__icons` \r\n- to replace the two `SVG`s that are currently within \r\n\r\nI implemented it in one of my projects using vanilla JS and thought that it might be nice to have it as and option available\r\n- as a ready component within Angular Material Examples page.\r\n\r\nhere is a screenshot from my app:\r\n\r\nLight Mode\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/64324417/e4e20c29-a450-4d44-b2b4-3e831bb94abe)\r\n\r\nDark Mode \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/64324417/0f37ecd0-8846-44ba-9c97-49b6669ec16a)\r\n\r\nI have now implemented it on a second app too \r\n- [view live](https://monacodelisa.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nThe `slide-toggle` component is often used as theme switcher, \r\nso I think that it would be very nice to have it ready and available. \r\n\r\nThe new design makes it easy to implement.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28977","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(slide-toggle): Customized slide toggle for theming featuring light / dark mode icon\" (#28977)"},{"Id":"2268333083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T07:35:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28976","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preview popover fixes","State":"open","Body":"Includes the following fixes related the preview popovers:\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/drag-drop): reset user agent color on preview popover\r\nAfter #28945 the preview is inserted into a `popover` element which has a user agent styling of `color: canvastext`.

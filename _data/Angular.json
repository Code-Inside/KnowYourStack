Our app does not use either `history.pushState` or `history.length`; and we suspect the Angular router is causing the issue. \r\n\r\nIf we were to not use Angular router, for argument's sake, then the errors go away, further supporting the above suspicion. Of course, we can not forgo the router; so I am hoping we can get some guidance from the Angular dev team here.\r\n\r\nTo recreate this, I have provided a sample project at https://github.com/findsujay/chrome-packaged-angular-sample. \r\n\r\n**Please note:**\r\n1. The issue does not occur when Chrome OS version is 108 or lower. \r\n2. This issue occurs in Angular 15 as well, so Angular version is not an issue. We do plan on upgrading to ng15, but that will not help for this issue.\r\n3. We are aware that Chrome packaged apps are on their way out. Google has announced they will sunset support for them in 2024 for Chrome OS, and we will be moving to an alternative platform. Until then we need to keep the production app running.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/findsujay/chrome-packaged-angular-sample\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nPlease follow the instructions in the provided sample project to build, deploy and test the issue. You will see 2 errors:\r\n\r\nError 1: history.pushState is not available in packaged apps\r\nError 2: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'index.html'\r\n\r\nAs observed above, the issue only occurs when Chrome OS version is 109 or higher. When Chrome version is 108 or lower, there are no errors.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.5\r\nNode: 19.5.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.3.1\r\nBuild OS: Win32 x64\r\nDeployed OS: Chrome OS 109 and higher\r\nChrome OS version: 109.0.5414.125\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1000.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1000.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                    10.0.5\r\nng-packagr                      10.1.2\r\nrxjs                            6.5.5\r\ntypescript                      3.9.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49066","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"history errors with Angular and Chrome OS when Chrome version > 108\" (#49066)"},{"Id":"1586593711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T21:31:22","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"49093","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(bazel): stop publishing @angular/bazel package to npm","State":"open","Body":"We are no longer publishing the `@angular/bazel` package in preparation for its removal from the angular/angular repo.

You can do this with a normal TS switch case by checking that the value is a `never` in the default case. This won't be possible in `NgSwitch`, but you can still do a runtime check to make sure each of the enum's values have been checked.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a `CheckExhaustive` directive. Store the `ngSwitchCase`s within `NgSwitch` and allow the `CheckExhaustive` directive to check the enum against the stored switch cases. Throw an error if a case is missed.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI tried making my own external directive and tried using the `_caseCount` value to compare the number of enum properties to. The problem there was that I could potentially add multiple of the same switch cases, which make the count unreliable to evaluate whether it exhaustively checks all the properties of the enum.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49089","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add CheckExhaustive directive for NgSwitch\" (#49089)"},{"Id":"1586396185","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T19:08:41","Actor":"ilyassFouih","Number":"49088","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): typo adding missing comma","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This bug affected both the `in` and `instanceof` keywords. Here's an example of the fix:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    π in a\n\n    // Old output (with --minify --charset=utf8)\n    πin a;\n\n    // New output (with --minify --charset=utf8)\n    π in a;\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a regression with esbuild's WebAssembly API in version 0.17.6 ([#&#8203;2911](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2911))\n\n    Version 0.17.6 of esbuild updated the Go toolchain to version 1.20.0. This had the unfortunate side effect of increasing the amount of stack space that esbuild uses (presumably due to some changes to Go's WebAssembly implementation) which could cause esbuild's WebAssembly-based API to crash with a stack overflow in cases where it previously didn't crash. One such case is the package `grapheme-splitter` which contains code that looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    if (\n      (0x0300 <= code && code <= 0x036F) ||\n      (0x0483 <= code && code <= 0x0487) ||\n      (0x0488 <= code && code <= 0x0489) ||\n      (0x0591 <= code && code <= 0x05BD) ||\n      // ... many hundreds of lines later ...\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This edge case involves a chain of binary operators that results in an AST over 400 nodes deep. Normally this wouldn't be a problem because Go has growable call stacks, so the call stack would just grow to be as large as needed. However, WebAssembly byte code deliberately doesn't expose the ability to manipulate the stack pointer, so Go's WebAssembly translation is forced to use the fixed-size WebAssembly call stack. So esbuild's WebAssembly implementation is vulnerable to stack overflow in cases like these.\n\n    It's not unreasonable for this to cause a stack overflow, and for esbuild's answer to this problem to be \"don't write code like this.\" That's how many other AST-manipulation tools handle this problem. However, it's possible to implement AST traversal using iteration instead of recursion to work around limited call stack space. This version of esbuild implements this code transformation for esbuild's JavaScript parser and printer, so esbuild's WebAssembly implementation is now able to process the `grapheme-splitter` package (at least when compiled with Go 1.20.0 and run with node's WebAssembly implementation).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.34.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.34.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.33.0...v8.34.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`9b2fcf7`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9b2fcf7e928fc92ac6d43617bdee1bda250b7491) feat: `array-callback-return` supports `Array.prototype.toSorted` ([#&#8203;16845](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16845)) (SUZUKI Sosuke)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`923f61d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/923f61d8fc82d83b912c6ba95abb5a509c4d7b52) fix: false positive with assignment in `no-extra-parens` ([#&#8203;16872](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16872)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`f0a9883`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f0a988384ea1a262150e70d83abd8a5e50c46fa7) docs: split rules documentation ([#&#8203;16797](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16797)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`67aa37b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/67aa37b583f059226b9c959672400f04ed6a56b5) docs: fix typo in command-line-interface.md ([#&#8203;16871](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16871)) (Kevin Rouchut)\n-   [`337f7ed`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/337f7ed96131d873be7ae6b010739476d0ad15e9) docs: fix width of language input ([#&#8203;16849](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16849)) (Tanuj Kanti)\n-   [`71349a1`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/71349a1f709baa361bd656a7ce4a7d35d857a9a8) docs: Configure a Parser page ([#&#8203;16803](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16803)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`de7e925`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/de7e925d03764f3681269b30bb60b92ee463c10f) docs: remove extra line numbers in example ([#&#8203;16848](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16848)) (jonz94)\n-   [`ad38d77`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ad38d77102d6fe30cfa92c831174f178bb35c88b) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`9dbe06d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9dbe06d0ad875e6d5964497e2975e8d789e763d0) chore: add `type` property to array-element-newline schema ([#&#8203;16877](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16877)) (MHO)\n-   [`a061527`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a061527a0332f0edf559acfc2902a327cae098d9) chore: Remove unused functions ([#&#8203;16868](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16868)) (Nicholas C.

You can see that in this devtools screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"421\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219161097-fc0ed586-e074-4d29-90cf-1693c016f089.png\">\r\n\r\nThe higher precedence style appears to be coming from the [embedded scss styles in the Angular matTable component itself.](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/table/table.scss) \r\n\r\n#### Forked version with scoped styles\r\nNext I tried creating a [fork with scoped styles](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ohqraz-kxbm3v?file=src%2Ftheme.scss,src%2Findex.html) for the stackblitz page (which is how my own application is configured).\r\n\r\n    .my-styles \r\n    {\r\n       @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the scoped selector has a higher precedence resulting in a row height of 52px as per spec.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"416\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219168579-cdf1c48b-f842-4ac2-819c-6dde65b79a9a.png\">\r\n\r\nSo **without** scoped styles (as in the example stackblitz) the behavior is not to spec.\r\n\r\n#### Another mat-table example in the docs\r\nAnother example on the same page [Flex table where one column's cells has a greater height than others](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-flex-large-row) suggests using the following css to set the height of a column (the 'name' column).\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-column-name {\r\n  height: 100px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"389\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219173091-19f6ac49-9b9d-4524-af82-4eb2c68720fc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThat works in the stackblitz, but as soon as you add scoped styles it fails spectacularly because the cells are of height 100px and the containing row is of height 52px!\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nFor my own needs I actually **want** the unset behavior, with perhaps a min-height because my rows need to grow with their content. I can figure out a workaround for now.\r\n\r\nI wanted to raise this since I can't find any other issues mentioning it and the current examples are not to spec since they don't use scoped styles.\r\n\r\nNote: I've only observed this with mat-table-row heights (I only updated to v15 yesterday), but it is potentially a wider issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0 / 15.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Non scoped style customizations behave differently from Scoped style customizations (css precedence conflict)\" (#26628)"},{"Id":"1586073189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T15:38:49","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26627","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26627","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options\" (#26627)"},{"Id":"1585853109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T13:21:37","Actor":"marcramser","Number":"26626","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: Datepicker outside visible area when opened in dialog","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the mat-datepicker is opened in a component shown with the MatDialogRef on a small screen, the calendar picker is shown outside the visible area.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

implement the ng-template context guard, as it is done at the *ngFor Structual Directive in the Angular Common package. \r\nThus, when using the *cdkVirtualFor Structual Directive in an HTML Template, the type of the item is \"any\". \r\n\r\nExpample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport itemSize=\"50\" class=\"example-viewport\">\r\n  <div *cdkVirtualFor=\"let item of items\"

Expected behavior\r\nThe type of the property \"item\" should be \"string\" when the type of \"items\" is \"string[]\".\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\nImplement the static method

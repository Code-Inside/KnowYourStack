This problem occurs when we navigate directly to a nested page. We do not start on AppComponent and let the user drill down manually. AppComponent contains nothing but a `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`.\r\n\r\nWe use Ngrx as our state management solution but our example removed Ngrx for simplicity to convey the problem.\r\n\r\nOur App workflow goes like this:\r\n- AppComponent kicks off some configuration tasks like \r\n   1. Checking which environment it's in \r\n   2. Which affiliate is loading  our app. \r\n   3. Remember me\r\n...and dispatches the application state to get the ball rolling\r\n\r\nIn the example indicated below, imagine the /lazy route is the default lazy route to forward to upon application start. '/lazy' needs to know that state is in a good state before displaying the page. \r\n\r\nOn 99% of our pages, we have CanActivate guards that dispatches state updates. Many of those guards rely on other state to be available before we dispatch more state changes. \r\n\r\nExample: User needs to be authenticated before we dispatch `loadTodoList()`. In Angular 16, we have in the guards, that require the user to be authenticated, a reactive check for whether the user is authenticated. Once the observable returns true, we execute the state update and return 'true' as guard results and the page displays.\r\n\r\nIn Angular 17, this no longer works.\r\n\r\nIn order to work around this new shortcoming, we had to deactivate all these guards and instead put all the \"init logic\" into the components; same for resolvers. Example: A resolver that would be responsible for setting the page title based on data that's returned from the server would also just hang the page because the state would never get into a ready-state. \r\n\r\nThe issue here is similar to the documentation on ApplicationRef.isStable(): [angular.io/ApplicationRef.isStable()](https://angular.io/api/core/ApplicationRef#isstable-examples-and-caveats). We were trying to get certain state to kick off when isStable turned true, but it never did, because the route guard was waiting on a ready-state of its own. Catch-22.\r\n\r\nThis worked prior to Angular 17 so will call this a regression.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/bjornharvold/ngrx-issue-4149\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\n2 things can occur based on with withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation():\r\n\r\n1.

If cmd is launched from the run window (WIN+R, \"cmd\") it builds fine. After some head scratching I realized that if I capitalize the drive letter in the \"start in\" property of the shortcut it builds fine (`C:\\some\\path\\here`).\r\n\r\nThis project was upgraded from 15.2.9 to 16 and then to 17 the following day. The issue wasn't discovered until it was upgraded to v17, but I'm not positive it didn't exist in 16 as I didn't try running the build from the offending shortcut.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI originally found this error on a large app that has been upgraded through several versions of Angular, but I was able to reproduce this with a freshly created app using the latest CLI (17.0.4)\r\n\r\n- Open a fresh command window directly (WIN+R, \"cmd\", enter) which should give you an upper case drive letter in the prompt\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd \\junk\r\nng new repro-app\r\ncd repro-app\r\nnpm run build\r\n# builds successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a shortcut to cmd  ( `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` )\r\n- Right click > Properties\r\n- Set \"Start in\" to a path starting with a lower case drive letter (`c:\\junk\\repro-app`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run build\r\n# fails with below error about main.ts and polyfills.ts not being part of the project\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nFile 'src\\main.ts' is missing from the TypeScript compilation.

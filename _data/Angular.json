In edge cases where `ApplicationRef` is\r\nnot available, consumers are created/discarded without pooling.\r\n\r\nWhile it is barely possible to create a unit test that reliably\r\nreproduces this multi-application scenario (due to module-level state\r\nand the need to simulate multiple app lifecycles in the same process),\r\nthe `WeakMap` approach is fundamentally safer than the previous global\r\nsingleton and the fix is necessary without considerations.\r\n\r\nFixes memory leaks in production SSR deployments and micro-frontend\r\narchitectures.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64978","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): scope reactive consumer pool per ApplicationRef\" (#64978)"},{"Id":"3597933832","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T22:47:24","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"64977","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add production build and vendor sourcemaps to `dev-app`","State":"open","Body":"/cc @mmalerba","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64977","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add production build and vendor sourcemaps to `dev-app`\" (#64977)"},{"Id":"3597877447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T22:21:59","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"64976","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add documentation for DOCUMENT injection token usage in SSR","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Dependency checks are also updated to ensure the correct `@vitest/browser-preview` package is installed when needed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For advanced scenarios, a custom runner config can be used to customize the browser configuration instead of using the builtin `--browsers` option and its automatic configuration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31711","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): add webcontainer support for Vitest browser provider\" (#31711)"},{"Id":"3591085737","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T21:33:11","Actor":"tlevequealithya","Number":"31700","RawContent":null,"Title":"Running two ng serve instances (same project, different configurations) causes “504 Outdated Optimize Dep” errors in Angular CLI 20.3.8","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.6\n\n### Description\n\nSince updating to Angular v20.3.9 / CLI v20.3.8, it’s no longer possible to run two ng serve instances for the same project (e.g. localized builds) in parallel.\nThe second instance fails to load with a 504 (Outdated Optimize Dep) error for one or more chunks (e.g. chunk-5V7QYGNA.js).\n\nThis setup worked correctly in previous Angular 20.3.6 versions (before the CLI migrated the dev-server to the Vite-based implementation).\n\nThe issue appears to be caused by both ng serve processes sharing the same Vite optimizer cache directory inside .angular/cache/.../vite.\nWhen one process updates or invalidates the cache, the other process detects stale metadata and refuses to serve pre-bundled chunks.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\npackage.json scripts\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"ng serve --host 0.0.0.0\",\n  \"startfr\": \"ng serve -c fr --host 0.0.0.0\",\n  \"startfr-alt\": \"ng serve -c fr --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201\",\n  \"start:both\": \"concurrently \\\"npm run start\\\" \\\"npm run startfr-alt\\\"\"\n}\n\nSteps to reproduce\n\t1.\tRun npm run start:both.\n\t2.\tWait for both dev servers to start.\n\t3.\tObserve that the second instance fails to load in the browser console with:\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 504 (Outdated Optimize Dep)\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 504 (Outdated Optimize Dep)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.8\nNode: 24.1.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.8\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.8\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.11\n@angular/cli                    20.3.8\n@angular/material               20.2.11\n@schematics/angular             20.3.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31700","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Running two ng serve instances (same project, different configurations) causes “504 Outdated Optimize Dep” errors in Angular CLI 20.3.8\" (#31700)"},{"Id":"3592121968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T18:04:55","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31709","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): promote zoneless migration MCP tool to stable","State":"closed","Body":"The zoneless migration tool has been moved from the experimental to the stable toolset within the MCP server, making it available by default.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): promote zoneless migration MCP tool to stable\" (#31709)"},{"Id":"3592195191","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-05T17:54:50","Actor":"brandonroberts","Number":"31710","RawContent":null,"Title":"HttpClient request fails in development during SSR with SSL enabled","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using `ng serve` with SSR and an SSL certificate the HttpClient request fails during SSR\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/brandonroberts/angular-ssl-assets\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n## Setup\n\n1.

This ensures they are initialized only once when the module is loaded, improving performance, and clearly separates static configuration from dynamic execution logic.\r\n- **Comprehensive JSDoc comments:** Extensive JSDoc comments have been added or updated throughout the file, including a file-level overview, detailed explanations for module-level constants, and updated documentation for key functions.

chrome android 13, dropdown collapses without selection","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have am having a bit of an issue with a mat-autocomplete.\nI have deployed the code base from `https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-require-selection-example.html&startScript=start` to `https://app-test.resparke.com` so I can test it on my Android 13 device.\nOn Android 10, IOS Safari 17, 18 etc, macbook Chrome, it all works good.\nBut not on Android 13' Chrome.\n\nWhat I can find from debugging is that when  I click it sometimes doesnt select a value but just collapses the soft keyboard.\n\nI created a recording with onclick debug output so you can see which element is clicked:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f33b41-b121-4780-9acf-79a6e1787689)\n\nI am not sure how to debug this, because the example I am using is pure and simple and 100% from angular mat website. \nI think the issues is related to the softkeyboard closing which does something with the overlay.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nAs mentioned above, the stackblitz example is deployed on `https://app-test.resparke.com` but you would have to run it on an Android 13  tablet , Chrome, with a soft keyboard and see this issue happening\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen option is selected, I expect that selection to be recorded. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen I open the test app on app-test.resparke.com, and I click on the formfield, the dropdown appears and the softkeyboard opens, I select option 2. The soft keyboard closes and no option is selected. When I click again on the formfield, the dropdown appears again and now I can select and option. That seems to be a consistent behaviour on Android 13/Chrome.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.x\n- CDK/Material: 202.2.12\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android 13\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MAT-AUTOCOMPLETE): on option select on chrome android 13, dropdown collapses without selection\" (#32275)"},{"Id":"3597975080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T23:06:02","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32274","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (21.0.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `bef47ad` -> `3986950` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `4a9ebbb` -> `7fa1ab5` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `4a9ebbb` -> `7fa1ab5` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - Every 2 hours, between 12:00 AM and 10:59 PM ( * 0-22/2 * * * ) in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

They sometimes have regular, tabbable elements (`<a>`, `<button>`) in their Shadow DOM and participate in the browser tab order as expected.\n\nHowever, the CDK `FocusTrap` machinery and the `_getFirstTabbableElement` / `_getLastTabbableElement` don't quite consider enough of the [sequential focus navigation]. That means that focus trapping in a dialog only works it there's at least one *focusable area* not in a Shadow DOM.\n\nFor performance reason, I don't think it's necessary to build up the full [sequential focus navigation order]. It'd probably be sufficient to use the [`\"DOM\"` selection mechanism](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#selection-mechanism-dom) i.e. find the first/last [suitable sequentially focusable area] element in [shadow including tree order] (host - shadow dom - light dom).\n\n[shadow including tree order]: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-tree-order\n[suitable sequentially focusable area]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#suitable-sequentially-focusable-area\n[sequential navigation search algorithm]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-navigation-search-algorithm\n[sequential focus navigation]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-focus-navigation\n[sequential focus navigation order]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-focus-navigation-order\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-2e9thbl6?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click in the preview window, preferably somewhere in the top part of the red area.\n2. Tab to see the focus (outline) on the button in the red area\n3. Tab to see the focus on the hidden trap element\n4. Tab to see the focus (outline) on the button in the blue area\n5. Keep Tabbing to see the focus actually get trapped\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe focus should remain trapped in the red area\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe focus moves past the red area, to an invisible item and then only gets trapped in the blue area.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19, 20\n- CDK/Material: 19, 20\n- Browser(s): Edge, Firefox\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11 Enterprise\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(a11y): FocusTrap doesn't match browser/spec tab order in relation to Shadow DOM\" (#32265)"},{"Id":"3593497556","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-06T01:48:24","Actor":"ajaygandecha","Number":"32264","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): fix stretched chip avatar image","State":"open","Body":"This PR fixes a bug in the Material chip component where avatar images were significantly vertically stretched on many browsers.

It looks like this could be achieved by calling `detach` on the `_RecycleViewRepeaterStrategy` instance in `_forceRenderDataRows`, but it's unclear the semantics of that method since it's not documented in `_ViewRepeater`. `CdkVirtualForOf` only calls it in `ngOnDestroy` and **`CdkTable` never calls it** (probably a separate bug where these row views get leaked when the table gets destroyed).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mssn6jgh?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-table-recycle-rows-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click `Set Short List` to reduce the number of rows to 15 (caching the 10 removed rows).\n2. Then click `Toggle Columns`. This forces a full re-render through `_forceRenderDataRows` (which doesn't populate the cache when removing).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll 15 rows re-render correctly\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen the 15 rows are re-rendered 5 have the old list of 3 columns since they were inserted from the cache and the remaining 10 are new rows and render correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2.4\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.4\n- Browser(s): 141.0.7390.126\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ChromeOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32253","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/table): CdkTable does not handle column updates correctly when using recycleRows\" (#32253)"},{"Id":"3584671427","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-04T04:33:30","Actor":"ajaygandecha","Number":"32251","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(chip): chip avatar images vertically stretched","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOn Safari, the chips with an avatar image appear to be significantly vertically stretched. This issue is also apparent in the example tab on the [chip component page](https://material.angular.dev/components/chips/examples), as shown below:\n\n**Safari (v26.0.1 on MacOS 26 (Tahoe)):**\n<img width=\"402\" height=\"162\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86762b-8cd4-44dd-9da7-dea74907f2e0\" />\n\nOn other browsers including Chrome, the issue is less prominent but still exists:\n\n**Chrome:**\n<img width=\"392\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf59247-1777-4a48-8c8e-48c1e70b9799\" />\n\n~~This appears to be an issue with Angular Material v19 and v18 as well, and this problem did not occur before the latest MacOS 26 (Tahoe) update. This issue also exists when opening the page with Safari iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 as well.~~ *Edit: Turns out the timings here was a coincidence and seems to exist across other browsers, including Chrome, not just Safari.*\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. View any implementation of the chip component with the avatar image on MacOS 26's Safari. The best example is on the docs here:\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/chips/examples\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is for the correct aspect ratio / sizing of the avatar image, like so:\n<img width=\"392\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf59247-1777-4a48-8c8e-48c1e70b9799\" />\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe actual behavior is an image significantly vertically stretched, like so:\n<img width=\"402\" height=\"162\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86762b-8cd4-44dd-9da7-dea74907f2e0\" />\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: v20\n- CDK/Material: v20.2.11\n- Browser(s): Safari\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS 26\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32251","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(chip): chip avatar images vertically stretched\" (#32251)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-07T03:30:02.7990457Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1984}

I noticed that the images are not showing on the page while I was working on the code. Instead, the places where the houses were supposed to show with their images, now shows \"\"Exterior photo of <housing location name>\". Thought I'd bring to your attention to hopefully get it fixed.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/assets/tutorials/common\n\n### Describe what you were looking

`message` field without affecting the emit","State":"open","Body":"We want to hide `.message` from users, but the previous approach is not compatible with a specific [TS 3.7 flag](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier) (\"using class fields to specialize properties

I received a request from the g3 TS team to fix this, so they can enable that flag.\r\n\r\nInstead, we just override `message` to `never` in the .d.ts using `declare`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55160","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): For `FatalDiagnosticError`, hide the `message` field without affecting the emit\" (#55160)"},{"Id":"2219002667","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-01T20:25:11","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"55159","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): fix type narrowing of `@if` with aliases","State":"open","Body":"When an `@if` expression has an alias, only the type of the alias is currently narrowed. So for example, suppose `value` is `string|undefined`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@if (value; as alias) {\r\n  {{ value.length }} <!-- error, value may be undefined -->\r\n  {{ alias.length }} <!-- no error, alias is narrowed -->\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is especially noticeable when the expression contains guards which are preconditions for the aliased expression:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@if (a && b; as alias) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `a` would not be narrowed within the body, even though the `@if` condition forces it to be truthy. This is a bug.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that aliased expressions were previously type-checked as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nvar alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // nothing other than alias is narrowed\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne option considered was to emit `const alias` instead of `var alias`. TypeScript _does_ trace `const` expressions and narrow their individual components when the overall expression is guarded:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // a, b are also narrowed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this narrowing has different semantics than if `a && b` appeared directly in the guard expression. For example, object properties aren't narrowed with this approach, so component properties (which are referenced as e.g. `this.a`) would not be narrowed.\r\n\r\nInstead, a different technique is used. The alias variable is declared with no type, and gets its type inferred by the guard expression:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nlet alias;\r\nif (alias = (a && b)) {\r\n  // a, b, and alias all narrowed correctly.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis form ensures all conditions within the guard expression get narrowed while also narrowing the alias variable type, and works for property narrowing as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #52855","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55159","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): fix type narrowing of `@if` with aliases\" (#55159)"},{"Id":"2218963363","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-01T19:58:37","Actor":"devknoll","Number":"55158","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add withDomEmulation() support","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Whats on this page instead, is just a brief explanation of NgComponentOutlet directive, and code example.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because the next point of this Angular Elements page, completely misses the mark. It shows the comparison of long block of code, that is allegedly needed without using custom elements, and how it easily can be done with them. The honest comparison would be with NgComponentOutlet directive instead.\r\n\r\nThe alleged \"Old way\", which isn't really described anywhere in documentation AFAIK:\r\n```\r\n// Previous dynamic-loading method required you to set up infrastructure\r\n  // before adding the popup to the DOM.\r\n  showAsComponent(message: string) {\r\n    // Create element\r\n    const popup = document.createElement('popup-component');\r\n\r\n    // Create the component and wire it up with the element\r\n    const popupComponentRef = [createComponent](https://next.angular.io/api/core/createComponent)(PopupComponent, {\r\n      environmentInjector: this.injector,\r\n      hostElement: popup,\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Attach to the view so that the change detector knows to run\r\n    this.applicationRef.attachView(popupComponentRef.hostView);\r\n\r\n    // Listen to the close event\r\n    popupComponentRef.instance.closed.subscribe(() => {\r\n      document.body.removeChild(popup);\r\n      this.applicationRef.detachView(popupComponentRef.hostView);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Set the message\r\n    popupComponentRef.instance.message = message;\r\n\r\n    // Add to the DOM\r\n    document.body.appendChild(popup);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the concise custom elements way:\r\n```\r\n// This uses the new custom-element method to add the popup to the DOM.\r\n  showAsElement(message: string) {\r\n    // Create element\r\n    const popupEl: [NgElement](https://next.angular.io/api/elements/NgElement) & [WithProperties](https://next.angular.io/api/elements/WithProperties)<PopupComponent> = document.createElement(\r\n      'popup-element',\r\n    ) as any;\r\n\r\n    // Listen to the close event\r\n    popupEl.addEventListener('closed', () => document.body.removeChild(popupEl));\r\n\r\n    // Set the message\r\n    popupEl.message = message;\r\n\r\n    // Add to the DOM\r\n    document.body.appendChild(popupEl);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way it is right now, seems like dishonest cherry-picking by author to sell the usage of custom elements. It would looked more honest, if the  then the comparison was between usage of NgComponentOutlet, not the low-level API that isn't even explained in the linked chapter, that is supposed to explain it.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://next.angular.io/guide/elements\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n-The page correctly links to a different page that explains the low-level API (used in the \"Example: A Popup Service\" section), instead of redirecting to page about NgComponentOutlet.\r\n-Or., in the \"Example: A Popup Service\" section,  show the comparison with NgComponentOutlet, and possibly suggest why you should use one way over another - assuming you \"own\" the component, and don't have to necessarily rely on custom element registry.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55148","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: Confusing information on Angular Elements guide page \" (#55148)"},{"Id":"2217870216","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-01T09:16:56","Actor":"Hsinky","Number":"55147","RawContent":null,"Title":" [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: translateFilterProvider <- translateFilter","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler, core\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nerror:` [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: translateFilterProvider <- translateFilter`\r\ntranslate.pipe.ts:\r\n```\r\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\r\n@Pipe({\r\n  name: 'translate'\r\n})\r\nexport class TranslatePipe implements PipeTransform {\r\n  transform(value: string): any {\r\n    return value + 111\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\napp.module.ts:\r\n```\r\nimport { TranslatePipe } from '../services/translate.pipe';\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [TranslatePipe],\r\n  entryComponents: [],\r\n})\r\nexport class ManagementModule {}\r\n```\r\nhtml:\r\n```\r\n{{'hello'|translate}}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n[$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: translateFilterProvider <- translateFilter\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\"@angular/cli\": \"12.2.3\",\r\n\"@angular/cdk\": \"12.2.3\",\r\n\"@angular/common\": \"12.2.3\",\r\n\"@angular/compiler\": \"12.2.3\",\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"12.2.3\",\r\n\r\n\"node\": \"^16.10\",\r\n\"npm\": \"^7.24\"\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55147","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \" [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: translateFilterProvider <- translateFilter\" (#55147)"},{"Id":"2217680313","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-01T07:07:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"55145","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I thought there was no `tabindex` until I found this comment which obiously said you can acces it through `[tabIndex]` https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20883#issuecomment-744759846.\r\n\r\nNow the first question: is it expected to have no mentions of the `tabIndex` in the documentation? Because there is already the `id` and `value` inputs for example and I believe the `tabIndex` could be there too. Also apprently I'm not the only one on the internet struggling knowing it exists. I think it could be a good addition to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you think it makes totally sense 🎉I'm super motivated to update the repository to see them. I already checked in the source code that all these components have a tabindex input:\r\n* button\r\n* checkbox\r\n* chips\r\n* datepicker\r\n* expansion-panel\r\n* radio\r\n* select\r\n* slide-toggle\r\n* tab\r\n* tree\r\nI also have the feeling that the documentation uses the comments from [angular/component](https://github.com/angular/component) and is generated in [angular/material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io). So I have the feeling I only need to update angular/component. As far as I understand there is already comments above the `tabIndex` input so it should be visible in the documentation. \r\n\r\nIf angular/component seems OK I was wondering maybe in angular/material.angular.io there is some filtering that ignores `tabIndex` but no mentions at all about `tabIndex` so I have the feeling that our problem doesn't lay there.\r\n\r\nLast point, in the API Report File for \"components-srcs\" I can see some attributes with `// (undocumented)` comment above. These attributes aren't visible in the documentation. But still, the `tabIndex` don't have this kind of comment above.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to fix this problem myself but it would be nice if someone could give me some hints on where to look.

This means that a person updating from v17.1.2 to v17.2.x or higher has a high likelihood of a broken application layout due to the library's changes. The m3 changes should not be considered minor changes according to [semver](https://semver.org/), and should have caused a v18.0.0 release instead.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have an application that has been laid out based upon the sizes of components in the m2 spec present in v17.1.x\r\n2. Update a supposedly non-breaking minor version, v17.2.x, and see the components all change size to match the m3 spec and break your application's layout.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA major version should be released and v17.x's latest version should be the latest version to align with the m2 spec.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA minor version was released and v17.x's latest version breaks applications that worked with v17.1.2.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Any\r\n- CDK/Material: v17.3.1\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28788","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): The m3 design spec updates are a breaking change, and should not be considered SemVer minor releases in v17.\" (#28788)"},{"Id":"2213158836","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T12:46:31","Actor":"ferhado","Number":"28791","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/dialog): Allow @Input for data sharing","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, Angular Material's MatDialog and CDK's Dialog components use `MAT_DIALOG_DATA` for passing data.

The difficulty is providing the new functionality without having a breaking API change. Options might be:\r\n* A new `@Input` to `RouterLink` and a new function on `Router` with the new matching options. The advantage here would be the ease of deprecating the old input and `isActive`. Disadvantage would be naming and increased API surface/two functions that serve the same purpose.\r\n* Adding the new options to the current `RouterLink` input as optional and using `{exact: boolean}` as the base configuration with the new options as overrides. Disadvantage is that it is a bit more confusing and doesn't move the `exact: boolean` towards deprecation. Maybe this is fine though? Or we can still deprecate it (even though it's still required) and indicate that the new options should be explicitly provided as well (even though they're optional). Making `exact` optional would be best for deprecation but it would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40303","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): Add options for containsTree\" (#40303)"},{"Id":"778242814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T17:22:53","Actor":"msabo1","Number":"40302","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix interchanged values","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Complete the first two milestones.\r\n2. Follow the instructions in [Add heroes functionality](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#add-heroes-functionality).\r\n3. The [Route Parameters](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#route-parameters) section is where things start to get confusing. The text refers to this code\r\n```html\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"['/hero', hero.id]\">\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the original Tour of Heroes tutorial; neither in [Part 4 (Services)](https://stackblitz.com/angular/dkjekblappg?file=src%2Fapp%2Fheroes%2Fheroes.component.html) nor in [Part 5 (In-App Navigation)](https://stackblitz.com/angular/lkeoljvavbl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fheroes%2Fheroes.component.html).\r\n\r\n4. In the following section, [`ActivatedRoute` in action](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#activated-route-in-action), we're told to paste the following code in `ngOnInit()`\r\n```typescript\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.hero$ = this.route.paramMap.pipe(\r\n    switchMap((params: ParamMap) =>\r\n      this.service.getHero(params.get('id')))\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut this yields several compilation errors because neither the `hero$` property in `HeroDetailComponent` nor the `getHero` method in `HeroService` have been declared yet. (`getHero` is defined in Part 5 of the TOH Tutorial, but the page refers to Part 4.)\r\n\r\nThe same section also contains this paragraph:\r\n\r\n> AsyncPipe handles the observable subscription and the component's hero property will be (re)set with the retrieved hero.\r\n\r\nHowever, `hero-detail.component.html` doesn't contain any references to `hero$`, nor does it contain the `async` pipe. It _does_ refer several times to the `hero` property, so I tried to replace these references with `(hero$ | async)` but this turns out to be illegal in the context of a two-way binding using `[(ngModel)]`.\r\n\r\n5. The following section, [Navigating back to the list component](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#navigating-back-to-the-list-component), talks about the `HeroDetailComponent` \"Back\" button, but no such button exists in `hero-detail.component.html`.\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\nIt should be possible to follow along the instructions in this tutorial using the sample code.\r\nIt seems that whoever wrote this tutorial was using a different version of the TOH tutorial.\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Unfortunatelly, I'm not able to verify the package size because `node ./scripts/build/build-packages-dist.js` fails on my system for some reason.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes are these:\r\n- Some custom operators were wrapped with another function even though they didn't need `source` Observable.\r\n- `from([x, y, z])` is the same as `of(x, y, z)` and using `of()` should be faster (I'll need to test this).\r\n\r\nThere are some other usecases that seem suspicious like using `from().pipe(mergeAll())` should be the same as using just `merge()` but I'll need to be able to run `build-packages-dist.js` to make sure it generates smaller package.\r\n\r\nBundle size `main-es2015` in `cli-hello-world-lazy-rollup` integration test dropped from expected `218507` to `217825`.\r\nBundle size `main-es2015` in `cli-hello-world-lazy` integration test dropped from expected `241837` to `241139`.\r\nSo both bundles are cca 700 B smaller.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the [removed records in `bundle.golden_symbols.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40290/files#diff-0ea07045c567fb07c48994161c0a3bfa5bd1a676bc484d0fd8d3f9c5c2bc5d8d).

One access token for normal app API and another for Microsoft Graph API where we fetch a members list from Azure Active Directory Group and use it in the app. We are using HttpClient from @angular/common/http package to make these API calls.\r\n\r\nAll the API calls works fine for desktop browsers but the problem is while sending the Graph API call https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/group-id/members from iPad browsers(tested in Safari, Chrome and Firefox), the headers are getting removed, so the access token is not passed resulting in 401 Unauthorized error. **This issue is happening exclusively for Graph API call in iPad browsers**.

I also looked if we had anything similar, but with no luck. \r\n\r\nI also tried doing divide and conquer approach removing some modules from the application and that made it work. However there was no exact rule which modules work and which dont, the distribution was quite random expect one thing if i made the app smaller, then it worked(by removing bigger modules).\r\n\r\nNext on my list was to add some logging in `patchAliasReferenceResolutionOrDie` for the nodes that were being traversed and I did not see any circular dependency that would cause an infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nThen i tried adjusting the implementation of `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` and was able to make this work by changing this part here:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Before \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function(node, ...args) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, ...args);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n// After \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function(node, checkChildren) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, checkChildren);\r\n  };\r\n``` \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/compiler-cli/src/transformers/patch_alias_reference_resolution.ts#L87\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change was made so that `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` looks exactly like the typescript implementation https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/microsoft/TypeScript@3eaa7c65f6f076a08a5f7f1946fd0df7c7430259/-/blob/src/compiler/checker.ts#L36179-36192 \r\n\r\nAnd this fixed the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents on why this fixed it is better explained when looking at compiled code of the function\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Before\r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function (node) {\r\n    var args = [];\r\n    for (var _i = 1, _len = arguments.length; _i < _len; _i++) {\r\n      args[_i - 1] = arguments[_i];\r\n    }\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n       return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call.apply(originalReferenceResolution, tslib_1.__spread([emitResolver, node], args));\r\n};\r\n\r\n// After \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function (node, checkChildren) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, checkChildren);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring tree traversal `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` in each call is creating its own local array copying the arguments and then spreading that back again to original implementation, so i suppose after certain number of calls the memory just gets over allowed threshold and breaks. \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is

The reason is when using Angular CLI there is no way of including `ng-annotate` as part of the pipeline for the AngularJs bits.\r\n\r\nWhat is the 2021 way of using ng-annotate for hybrid applications?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like a \"plugins\" section where I could specify \"ng-annotate\" and only for files that match a regex (the AngularJs files).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI've considered:\r\n1. **Ejecting the configuration and not using ng-cli.** I don't like this solution as I want to use Angular CLI and reduce customizations (so upcoming upgrades are smoother).\r\n1. **Running ng-annotate on each of the Angular files by hand, and permanently replacing the original files.** But it's rather involved, I'd need to write a script that:\r\n    - Removes the imports from the top of my files (because ng-annotate doesn't like \"imports/exports\" in non-module files).\r\n    - Runs ng-annotate in each one, redirecting the output to a file, then swapping the files.\r\n1. **Continuing to use the non-optimized version of my product in production**. My company's product is quite large, and it is taking several seconds to download and bootstrap, so this is exactly what I want to avoid.\r\n1. **Using a custom webpack config prepended to ng-cli's one.** I found it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59302237/how-to-use-ng-annotate-with-hybrid-app-based-on-angular-cli).\r\n\r\nSo far it looks like number 4 is what I'm going to try, otherwise doing number 2.

The documentation makes it seem like 'ngSrc' is a drop-in-replacement for the `src` attribute with no warning or indication that there are significant regressions in functionality when using it as such. Note: IDE's such as JetBrains Webstorm actively lint against using `src` and suggest replacing it with `ngSrc` in Angular projects.\r\n\r\nRemoving these assertions shows expected behavior without any issues. So why was this introduced? Maybe there is a great reason for these changes... the commit description provides 0 insight and the error message asking users to simply stop using it is not a fantastic UX.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://angular.io/api/common/NgOptimizedImage\r\n[2]: https://angular.io/guide/image-directive\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nRevert the commit and allow those inputs. Happy to do a PR but would like confirmation that there isn't some special reasons for this constraint first.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAdd documentation to:\r\n1) The directive documentation outlining there are clear caveats and regressions going from ngSrc to src.\r\n2) The source logic indicating _why_ these assertions are needed (a simple one liner like `// These types conflict with Foo logic, so we prevent them from being used` helps posterity tremendously).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55762","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[NgOptimizedImage] Revert Assertions Against Blob and Data URL's or Document the Rationale\" (#55762)"},{"Id":"2290989595","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-11T16:56:38","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55761","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): Don't send updates for identical input values","State":"open","Body":"In case an input event sends the same value to our forms, we will discard the update and consider the input hasn't change.

Please see the code below. This is a standard way to test that something throwing an error. However, this unit test does not pass saying that exception was not thrown. Notably, the expected thrown error is visible in the terminal.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyComponent {\r\n  name = input.required<string>();\r\n  \r\n  private validateNameEffect = effect(() => {\r\n    if (this.name() !== 'Tom') {\r\n      throw new Error('Not Tom')\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('should throw error', () => {\r\n  expect(() => {\r\n    const fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      imports: [MyComponent],\r\n    }).createComponent(MyComponent);\r\n\t\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n\t\r\n    TestBed.flushEffects();\r\n  }).toThrow()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI figured out a way to make test pass using custom `ErrorHandler`.

Some icons appear to be replaced with the name of these icons when the page is translated. Apparently it's all over the site, I'll be attaching two images to the afterContentInit page to exemplify and better explain the error.\r\n\r\nObviously it is not something that affects the functioning of the site, I believe, however, I believe that for some developers who speak Portuguese regardless of the country, for example I am from Brazil, their understanding of the content may be affected by these errors, especially if they are more beginners in this vast universe of Angular Framework. In particular, this doesn't affect me in my reading and studies of Angular but I believe it could affect other users.

At the same time, any allowlist or source expressions such as 'self' or 'unsafe-inline' will be ignored.\r\n\r\nBased on that documentation I would expect both cases to work. For the esbuild case, we are allowing `main.js` via sha384, which should then be allowed to import further scripts.

this)\n\nℹ️ Important changes added to the `.verdaccio-db.json` and token signature for users that run on Node.js 22 or higher (in the future 🙃 ) please read\nhttps://verdaccio.org/docs/configuration/#.verdaccio-db\n\nTLDR:\n\n-   Enforced for users that runs verdaccio **via npmjs**, for all Docker image isuers, verdaccio uses Node.js LTS 21 and the secret migration is **voluntary** until next major release.\n-   For **Node.js 21** or lower a new *deprecation* will appear `  [VERWAR007] VerdaccioDeprecation: the secret length is too lon... ` to remove it please read the link above\n-   For **Node.js 22** if you have already a storage with `.verdaccio-db.json` and the token inside does not complies with the length (read link above) **the application startup will fail with fatal error (`Error: Invalid storage secret key length, must be 32 characters long but is....`)**\n\nIn both cases by updating the *secret* all previously tokens will get invalid, in your benefit a new legacy signature will be applied and is more secure than the old one (generating tokens with salt).\n\nFor existing installations that have no issues by invalidating tokens is recommended to add to the `config.yaml` the following setup, this will automatically generate a new the secret once is started, could be removed aftewards, if all went succesfull the `[VERWAR007]` deprecation will not be displayed anymore.\n\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n  api:\n    migrateToSecureLegacySignature: true\n```\n\nAny new installation should not worry about this, new token signature and secret (32 characters) is applied by default.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add property forceMigrateToSecureLegacySignature

In a large multirepo project for example, it is non-trivial to make a performant ssr-dev-server implementation, since it is required to watch for changes, rebuild and write to file. It would be convenience and efficient to be able to resuse, for example, an existing in-memory optimized dev-server to serve files to CommonEngine in dev workflow.\r\n\r\nAlso, since Fetch now exists in Node V17 above, it would mean a significant improvement for very few lines of code\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI should be able to do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst html = await commonEngine.render({\r\n   bootstrap: AppServerModule,\r\n   documentFilepath: 'localhost:4000/deploy-path', // any network path or file path\r\n   publicPath: 'localhost:4000/public-path' // any network path or file path,\r\n   url,\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIt is possible to manually fetch the `indexHtml`, but since the details of fetching static assets references from within the `indexHtml` is abstracted within `publicPath`, this approach is not feasible","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27606","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CommonEngine.render should be able to read documentFilePath and publicPath from network path and not only file path\" (#27606)"},{"Id":"2284720881","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T05:38:46","Actor":"ahnpnl","Number":"27611","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: [ngtools] Replace resource transformer issue with conditional `templateUrl`","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\ntest\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen having conditional `templateUrl` like this\r\n```\r\n  templateUrl:\r\n    true === true\r\n        ?

[`v0.21.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0210)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.20.2...v0.21.0)\n\nThis release doesn't contain any deliberately-breaking changes. However, it contains a very complex new feature and while all of esbuild's tests pass, I would not be surprised if an important edge case turns out to be broken. So I'm releasing this as a breaking change release to avoid causing any trouble. As usual, make sure to test your code when you upgrade.\n\n-   Implement the JavaScript decorators proposal ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now contains an implementation of the upcoming [JavaScript decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). This is the same feature that shipped in [TypeScript 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) and has been highly-requested on esbuild's issue tracker. You can read more about them in that blog post and in this other (now slightly outdated) extensive blog post here: https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html. Here's a quick example:\n\n    ```js\n    const log = (fn, context) => function() {\n      console.log(`before ${context.name}`)\n      const it = fn.apply(this, arguments)\n      console.log(`after ${context.name}`)\n      return it\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;log static foo() {\n        console.log('in foo')\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Logs \"before foo\", \"in foo\", \"after foo\"\n    Foo.foo()\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature is different than the existing \"TypeScript experimental decorators\" feature that esbuild already implements. It uses similar syntax but behaves very differently, and the two are not compatible (although it's sometimes possible to write decorators that work with both). TypeScript experimental decorators will still be supported by esbuild going forward as they have been around for a long time, are very widely used, and let you do certain things that are not possible with JavaScript decorators (such as decorating function parameters). By default esbuild will parse and transform JavaScript decorators, but you can tell esbuild to parse and transform TypeScript experimental decorators instead by setting `\"experimentalDecorators\": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n    Probably at least half of the work for this feature went into creating a test suite that exercises many of the proposal's edge cases: https://github.com/evanw/decorator-tests. It has given me a reasonable level of confidence that esbuild's initial implementation is acceptable. However, I don't have access to a significant sample of real code that uses JavaScript decorators. If you're currently using JavaScript decorators in a real code base, please try out esbuild's implementation and let me know if anything seems off.\n\n    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**\n\n    This proposal has been in the works for a very long time (work began around 10 years ago in 2014) and it is finally getting close to becoming part of the JavaScript language. However, it's still a work in progress and isn't a part of JavaScript yet, so keep in mind that any code that uses JavaScript decorators may need to be updated as the feature continues to evolve. The decorators proposal is pretty close to its final form but it can and likely will undergo some small behavioral adjustments before it ends up becoming a part of the standard. If/when that happens, I will update esbuild's implementation to match the specification. I will not be supporting old versions of the specification.\n\n-   Optimize the generated code for private methods\n\n    Previously when lowering private methods for old browsers, esbuild would generate one `WeakSet` for each private method. This mirrors similar logic for generating one `WeakSet` for each private field. Using a separate `WeakMap` for private fields is necessary as their assignment can be observable:\n\n    ```js\n    let it\n    class Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        it = this\n      }\n    }\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #x = 1\n      #y = null.foo\n      static check() {\n        console.log(#x in it, #y in it)\n      }\n    }\n    try { new Foo } catch {}\n    Foo.check()\n    ```\n\n    This prints `true false` because this partially-initialized instance has `#x` but not `#y`. In other words, it's not true that all class instances will always have all of their private fields. However, the assignment of private methods to a class instance is not observable. In other words, it's true that all class instances will always have all of their private methods. This means esbuild can lower private methods into code where all methods share a single `WeakSet`, which is smaller, faster, and uses less memory. Other JavaScript processing tools such as the TypeScript compiler already make this optimization. Here's what this change looks like:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      #x() { return this.#x() }\n      #y() { return this.#y() }\n      #z() { return this.#z() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _x, x_fn, _y, y_fn, _z, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _x);\n        __privateAdd(this, _y);\n        __privateAdd(this, _z);\n      }\n    }\n    _x = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _x, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _y = new WeakSet();\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _y, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _z = new WeakSet();\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _z, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n\n    // New output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _Foo_instances, x_fn, y_fn, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _Foo_instances);\n      }\n    }\n    _Foo_instances = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    ```\n\n-   Fix an obscure bug with lowering class members with computed property keys\n\n    When class members that use newer syntax features are transformed for older target environments, they sometimes need to be relocated. However, care must be taken to not reorder any side effects caused by computed property keys. For example, the following code must evaluate `a()` then `b()` then `c()`:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild did this by shifting the computed property key *forward* to the next spot in the evaluation order. Classes evaluate all computed keys first and then all static class elements, so if the last computed key needs to be shifted, esbuild previously inserted a static block at start of the class body, ensuring it came before all other static class elements:\n\n    ```js\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, this could cause esbuild to accidentally generate a syntax error if the computed property key contains code that isn't allowed in a static block, such as an `await` expression. With this release, esbuild fixes this problem by shifting the computed property key *backward* to the previous spot in the evaluation order instead, which may push it into the `extends` clause or even before the class itself:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [await b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = await b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a, _b;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      [(_b = a(), _a = await b(), _b)]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix some `--keep-names` edge cases\n\n    The [`NamedEvaluation` syntax-directed operation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-namedevaluation) in the JavaScript specification gives certain anonymous expressions a `name` property depending on where they are in the syntax tree. For example, the following initializers convey a `name` value:\n\n    ```js\n    var foo = function() {}\n    var bar = class {}\n    console.log(foo.name, bar.name)\n    ```\n\n    When you enable esbuild's `--keep-names` setting, esbuild generates additional code to represent this `NamedEvaluation` operation so that the value of the `name` property persists even when the identifiers are renamed (e.g. due to minification).\n\n    However, I recently learned that esbuild's implementation of `NamedEvaluation` is missing a few cases. Specifically esbuild was missing property definitions, class initializers, logical-assignment operators. These cases should now all be handled:\n\n    ```js\n    var obj = { foo: function() {} }\n    class Foo0 { foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo1 { static foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo2 { accessor foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo3 { static accessor foo = function() {} }\n    foo ||= function() {}\n    foo &&= function() {}\n    foo ??= function() {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote (pacote)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.5`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1805-2024-05-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v18.0.4...v18.0.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`5e75582`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/5e755820b70f60ea136d9e85eb42a6c2d9718472) [#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/368) dont set \\_contentLength if not in headers ([#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/368)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) move bin to its own directory ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) refactor: symbol cleanup ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/365)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.77.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1770)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.76.0...1.77.0)\n\n-   *Don't* throw errors for at-rules in keyframe blocks.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

On the variant that I took as a basis, there is the enter method, which was cut out in new versions of the material and advised to use: _dropListRef, but as a result, when I uncomment the lines in my version from 160 to 162, I get an error about exceeding the call stack, if left commented out, sorting begins to work from the second move, after the first dragging, the element returns to its place. And under any conditions, for some reason, the rearrangement of blocks begins to work after the second tug-of-war.\r\n2. And the second error, if you leave the current option, it begins to work out as described above after we start moving the cell for the second time, and it works only smoothly until the next cell, after the visual starts to glitch and a lot of errors come from ClientRect, although the logic works and the cell will stand where it is translucent, but visually it stops moving.\r\nIf possible, please tell me what the problem might be and how it can be fixed, or maybe you have better examples of how to implement it so that it looks like the first example?

the container","State":"open","Body":"This pull request is a proposal to fix coordinates emitted from the trigger element when it's different than the container element.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen a pointer down event (`mousedown: MouseEvent` or `touchstart: TouchEvent`) is emitted from the trigger element, its `clientX` and `clientY` properties are used to call `RippleRender::fadeInRipple`.\r\n\r\nIn case where the trigger element is the ripple container element, `clientX` and `clientY` are _inside_ the container dom rect.\r\n\r\nBut when the trigger element is different than the ripple container element (a trigger element can be set by using `matRippleTrigger` input), `clientX` and `clientY` are _outside_ the container dom rect.\r\n\r\n**Expeded behavior**\r\n\r\nIn case where the trigger element is different than the ripple container element, using `clientX` and `clientY` properties and calculating an equivalent point in the container element before calling `RippleRender::fadeInRipple`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-gtvxae\r\n\r\n* The div \"Ripple Container\" is the

positionned inside the trigger dom rect)\r\n* When \"Trigger Ripple with expected behavior\" button is clicked, the `clientX` and `clientY` properties are fixed and the ripple element (green dot in screenshot below) is positionned correctly inside the ripple container dom

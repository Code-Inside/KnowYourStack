the framework and either updating existing APIs to support standalone or creating new APIs that allowed to use Router, HttpClient and other abstractions without NgModules.\r\n\r\nBased on the mentioned work to review and stabilize APIs and also based on the positive feedback from the community, we are happy to announce that the Standalone APIs are promoted to stable!\r\n\r\nThis commit updates vast majority of standalone-related APIs to drop the `@developerPreview` label, which effectively documents then as stable.\r\n\r\nTwo APIs that retained the `@developerPreview` annotations are:\r\n- withRequestsMadeViaParent (from `@angular/common/http`)\r\n- renderApplication (from `@angular/platform-server`)\r\n\r\nWe plan to collect some additional feedback for the mentioned APIs and

browser memory leak in our Angular application. It is large enough that it will crash the browser after about 10 minutes of navigating between screens. It is particularly bad on grids. The more rows, the larger the leak. It seems to be triggered by Material attributes like matSort and mat-menu. I have tried the latest version of Edge and Chrome. Please use Edge, since you can see the leak by the Detached Elements tab in DevTools. You can also use More Tools/Browser task manager to monitor the memory and watch it slowly rise as you click back and forth between the links on the page.\r\n\r\nI have provided a small sample application that reproduces the leak. The description in the repo explains how to run the app and reproduce the leak.

AbstractControl.status$ Observables","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nAngular forms expose 2 Observables: `valueChanges` and `statusChanges`.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are hot Observables, meaning that if you subscribe after the last change has emitted, you don't receive the value of the control (or its status) until it changes again.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying in case we want to calculate derived states from the form via RxJS.\r\n\r\nInstead of this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.valueChanges.pipe(\r\n  map(({ name, surname }) => name + ' ' + surname)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'd have to introduce `startsWith`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.valueChanges.pipe(\r\n  startsWith(this.form.value),\r\n  map(({ name, surname }) => name + ' ' + surname)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this isn't even enough, because if the subscriber arrives too late (eg. ngIf + async pipe), `startsWith` will return the **initial** value of the control, as I explained [in this article](https://michelestieven.medium.com/angular-derived-values-from-forms-with-rxjs-48760807ed1e?sk=93001042b44c39420848ba2764731f67).\r\n\r\nIn many occasions I suggested something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction valueChanges(control: AbstractControl) {\r\n  return defer(() => of(control.value)).pipe(\r\n    concatWith(control.valueChanges)\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Always reliable\r\nfullName$ = valueChanges(this.form).pipe(map(...));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd same for the status. It's not the end of the world, but it's yet something more that the dev has to add to its cauldron of `utilities.tsx` and remember to use.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think it'd be very convenient to provide 2 more Observables: `value$` and `status$`, which always replay the latest value of the control to the subscribers.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfullName$ = this.form.value$.pipe(map(...));\r\n\r\ncanSubmit$ = this.form.status$.pipe(map(...));\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing getters:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nget fullName() {\r\n  const { name, surname } = this.form.value;\r\n  return name + ' ' + surname;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is not reactive programming and it has several drawbacks, such as:\r\n- Worse performance\r\n- No async flows, debouncing / throttling is hard, no flattening operator capabilities...\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47739","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request for AbstractControl.value$ and AbstractControl.status$ Observables\" (#47739)"},{"Id":"1405195348","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-11T20:34:56","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"47737","RawContent":null,"Title":"Language Service: Automatic Import Improvements","State":"open","Body":"I recently implemented auto-imports in the language service in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47088.

As a replacement for `true`, you can use \"compat\"\n    -   Emitted assets no longer have an `isAsset` flag in the bundle\n    -   Rollup will no longer fix assets added directly to the bundle by adding the `type: \"asset\"` field\n-   Some features that were previously marked for deprecation now show warnings when used ([#&#8203;4552](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4552)):\n    -   Some options have been deprecated:\n        -   `inlineDynamicImports` as part of the input options: use `output. inlineDynamicImports`\n        -   `manualChunks` as part of the input options: use ` output. manualChunks  `\n        -   `maxParallelFileReads`: use \\`maxParallelFileOps\n        -   `output.preferConst`: use `output.generatedCode.constBindings`\n        -   `output.dynamicImportFunction`: use the `renderDynamicImport` plugin hook\n        -   `output.namespaceToStringTag`: use `output.generatedCode.symbols`\n        -   `preserveModules` as part of the input options: use ` output. preserveModules  `\n    -   You should no longer access `this.moduleIds` in plugins: use `this.getModuleIds()`\n    -   You should no longer access `this.getModuleInfo(...).hasModuleSideEffects` in plugins: use `this.getModuleInfo(...).moduleSideEffects`\n-   Configuration files are only bundled if either the `--configPlugin` or the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` options are used. The configuration is bundled to an ES module unless the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` option is used. In all other cases, configuration is now loaded using Node's native mechanisms ([#&#8203;4574](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4574) and [#&#8203;4621](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4621))\n-   The properties attached to some errors have been changed so that there are fewer different possible properties with consistent types ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Some errors have been replaced by others (ILLEGAL_NAMESPACE_REASSIGNMENT -> ILLEGAL_REASSIGNMENT, NON_EXISTENT_EXPORT -> MISSING_EXPORT) ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Files in `rollup/dist/*` can only be required using their file extension ([#&#8203;4581](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4581))\n-   The `loadConfigFile` helper now has a named export of the same name instead of a default export ([#&#8203;4581](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4581))\n-   When using the API and sourcemaps, sourcemap comments are contained in the emitted files and sourcemaps are emitted as regular assets ([#&#8203;4605](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4605))\n-   Watch mode no longer uses Node's EventEmitter but a custom implementation that awaits Promises returned from event handlers ([#&#8203;4609](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4609))\n-   Assets may only be deduplicated with previously emitted assets if their source is a `string` ([#&#8203;4644](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4644))\n-   By default, Rollup will keep external dynamic imports as `import(…)` in commonjs output unless `output.dynamicImportInCjs` is set to false ([#&#8203;4647](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4647))\n\n##### Changes to Rollup Options\n\n-   As functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk, they should be careful to avoid performance-heavy operations ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   `entryFileNames/chunkFileNames` functions now longer have access to the rendered module information via `modules`, only to a list of included `moduleIds` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The path of a module is no longer prepended to the corresponding chunk when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   When preserving modules, the `[name]` placeholder (as well as the `chunkInfo.name` property when using a function) now includes the relative path of the chunk as well as optionally the file extension if the extension is not one of `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `[ext]`, `[extName]` and `[assetExtName]` placeholders are no longer supported when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `perf` option no longer collects timings for the asynchronous part of plugin hooks as the readings were wildly inaccurate and very misleading, and timings are adapted to the new hashing algorithm ([#&#8203;4566](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4566))\n-   Change the default value of `makeAbsoluteExternalsRelative` to \"ifRelativeSource\" so that absolute external imports will no longer become relative imports in the output, while relative external imports will still be renormalized ([#&#8203;4567](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4567))\n-   Change the default for `output.generatedCode.reservedNamesAsProps` to no longer quote properties like `default` by default ([#&#8203;4568](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4568))\n-   Change the default for `preserveEntrySignatures` to \"exports-only\" so that by default, empty facades for entry chunks are no longer created ([#&#8203;4576](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4576))\n-   Change the default for `output.interop` to \"default\" to better align with NodeJS interop ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Change the default for `output.esModule` to \"if-default-prop\", which only adds \\__esModule when the default export would be a property ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Change the default for `output.systemNullSetters` to `true`, which requires at least SystemJS 6.3.3 ([#&#8203;4649](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4649))\n\n##### Plugin API Changes\n\n-   Plugins that add/change/remove imports or exports in `renderChunk` should make sure to update `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` accordingly ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The order of plugin hooks when generating output has changed ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Chunk information passed to `renderChunk` now contains names with hash placeholders instead of final names, which will be replaced when used in the returned code or `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543) and [#&#8203;4631](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4631))\n-   Hooks defined in output plugins will now run after hooks defined in input plugins (used to be the other way around) ([#&#8203;3846](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3846))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk with some chunk information ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Plugins can access the entire chunk graph via an additional parameter in `renderChunk` ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Chunk hashes only depend on the actual content of the chunk and are otherwise stable against things like renamed/moved source files or changed module resolution order ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   The length of generated file hashes can be customized both globally and per-chunk ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   When preserving modules, the regular `entryFileNames` logic is used and the path is included in the `[name]` property. This finally gives full control over file names when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   `output.entryFileNames` now also supports the `[hash]` placeholder when preserving modules ([#&#8203;4565](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4565))\n-   The `perf` option will now collect (synchronous) timings for all plugin hooks, not just a small selection ([#&#8203;4566](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4566))\n-   All errors thrown by Rollup have `name: RollupError` now to make clearer that those are custom error types ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Error properties that reference modules (such as id and ids) will now always contain the full ids. Only the error message will use shortened ids ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   Errors that are thrown in response to other errors (e.g. parse errors thrown by acorn) will now use the standardized cause property to reference the original error ([#&#8203;4579](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4579))\n-   If sourcemaps are enabled, files will contain the appropriate sourcemap comment in `generateBundle` and sourcemap files are available as regular assets ([#&#8203;4605](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4605))\n-   Returning a Promise from an event handler attached to a RollupWatcher instance will make Rollup wait for the Promise to resolve ([#&#8203;4609](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4609))\n-   There is a new value \"compat\" for output.interop that is similar to \"auto\" but uses duck-typing to determine if there is a default export ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   There is a new value \"if-default-prop\" for esModule that only adds an `__esModule` marker to the bundle if there is a default export that is rendered as a property ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   Rollup can statically resolve checks for `foo[Symbol.toStringTag]` to \"Module\" if foo is a namespace ([#&#8203;4611](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4611))\n-   There is a new CLI option `--bundleConfigAsCjs` which will force the configuration to be bundled to CommonJS ([#&#8203;4621](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4621))\n-   Import assertions for external imports that are present in the input files will be retained in ESM output ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Rollup will warn when a module is imported with conflicting import assertions ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Plugins can add, remove or change import assertions when resolving ids ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   The `output.externalImportAssertions` option allows to turn off emission of import assertions ([#&#8203;4646](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4646))\n-   Use `output.dynamicImportInCjs` to control if dynamic imports are emitted as `import(…)` or wrapped `require(…)` when generating commonjs output ([#&#8203;4647](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4647))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Chunk hashes take changes in `renderChunk`, e.g. minification, into account ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   Hashes of referenced assets are properly reflected in the chunk hash ([#&#8203;4543](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4543))\n-   No longer warn about implicitly using default export mode to not tempt users to switch to named export mode and break Node compatibility ([#&#8203;4624](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4624))\n-   Avoid performance issues when emitting thousands of assets ([#&#8203;4644](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4644))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3846](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3846): \\[v3.0] Run output plugins last

[`v15.0.0-next.6`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1500-next6-2022-10-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/15.0.0-next.5...15.0.0-next.6)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n-   Invalid constructors for DI may now report compilation errors\n\n    When a class inherits its constructor from a base class, the compiler may now\n    report an error when that constructor cannot be used for DI purposes. This may\n    either be because the base class is missing an Angular decorator such as\n    `@Injectable()` or `@Directive()`, or because the constructor contains parameters\n    which do not have an associated token (such as primitive types like `string`).\n    These situations used to behave unexpectedly at runtime, where the class may be\n    constructed without any of its constructor parameters, so this is now reported\n    as an error during compilation.\n\n    Any new errors that may be reported because of this change can be resolved either\n    by decorating the base class from which the constructor is inherited, or by adding\n    an explicit constructor to the class for which the error is reported.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular no longer supports Node.js versions `14.[15-19].x` and `16.[10-12].x`. Current supported versions of Node.js are `14.20.x`, `16.13.x` and `18.10.x`.\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.8 are no longer supported.\n\n##### forms\n\n-   setDisabledState will always be called when a `ControlValueAccessor` is attached. You can opt-out with `FormsModule.withConfig` or `ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig`.\n\n##### router\n\n-   `relativeLinkResolution` is no longer configurable in\n    the Router. This option was used as a means to opt out of a bug fix.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   The `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` token is now deprecated in favor\n    of the `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` token, which accepts an object\n    as a value and the timezone can be defined as a field (called `timezone`)\n    on that object.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RouterLinkWithHref` directive is deprecated, use the `RouterLink` directive instead. The `RouterLink` contains the code from the `RouterLinkWithHref` to handle elements with `href` attributes.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c0c7efaf7c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c0c7efaf7c8a53c1a6f137aac960757cc804f263) | feat | add `provideLocationMocks()` function to provide Location mocks ([#&#8203;47674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47674)) |\n| [75e6297f09](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/75e6297f0901cc98aea1626a138a820e68d026ec) | feat | add <link> preload tag on server for priority img ([#&#8203;47343](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47343)) |\n| [4fde292bb5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4fde292bb58f5d5bc3cf6e634f7cff9eb0d13d84) | feat | Add automatic srcset generation to ngOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;47547](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47547)) |\n| [9483343ebf](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9483343ebf958297ebcb81ef313d356296a41f41) | feat | Add fill mode to NgOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;47738](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47738)) |\n| [bdb5371033](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bdb5371033d8e9a110619861323e8383a32d5900) | feat | add injection token for default DatePipe configuration ([#&#8203;47157](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47157)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [39b72e208b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/39b72e208b46d80f1d9a802cebf043c2ccf3c5f2) | fix | update element schema ([#&#8203;47552](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47552)) |\n| [48b354a83e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/48b354a83e6d94735a03eebb3a52c5698e7a0f44) | fix | update element schema ([#&#8203;47552](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47552)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [38078e7adb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/38078e7adb79c058d2cb1dfe2e8d11f7304d4e5d) | fix | add missing period to error message ([#&#8203;47744](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/47744)) |\n| [bc54687c7b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bc54687c7b91efe451aa744d2d3a15ca3524231e) | fix | exclude abstract classes from `strictInjectionParameters` requirement ([#&#8203;44615](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44615)) |\n| [19ad4987f9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/19ad4987f9070222bb2fb8bd07a43ed7995f602a) | fix | use [@&#8203;ts-ignore](https://togithub.com/ts-ignore).

An example of this method code with the validation:\r\n\r\n` \r\ntodoItemSelectionToggle(node: TodoItemFlatNode): void {\r\n    if(!this.checklistSelection.isSelected(node) || (this.checklistSelection.isSelected(node) && this.descendantsAllSelected(node))){\r\n      this.checklistSelection.toggle(node);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const descendants = this.treeControl.getDescendants(node);\r\n    this.checklistSelection.isSelected(node)\r\n      ? this.checklistSelection.select(...descendants)\r\n      : this.checklistSelection.deselect(...descendants);\r\n  } \r\n`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter select again a parent with partially selected children, parent appear as selected but none of its children appear as selected.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- mat-tree example on https://stackblitz.com/angular/gabkadkvybq\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25798","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-tree): Example bug on https://stackblitz.com/angular/gabkadkvybq\" (#25798)"},{"Id":"1406502617","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T17:00:23","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"25797","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update labels to match standardized labels","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25797","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update labels to match standardized labels\" (#25797)"},{"Id":"1406173508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T16:00:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25795","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix datepicker and button docs","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes the spacing in one of the button docs examples, and switches the datepicker docs to MDC.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix datepicker and button docs\" (#25795)"},{"Id":"1406238198","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T13:39:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"25796","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: write slider section of mdc-migration guide","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25796","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: write slider section of mdc-migration guide\" (#25796)"},{"Id":"1402176624","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T07:07:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25778","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/menu): add support for passing in data to the menu template","State":"closed","Body":"Adds the `cdkMenuTriggerData` and `cdkContextMenuTriggerData` inputs that allow the consumer of a CDK menu to pass context data to the menu template.\r\n\r\nFixes #25708.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25778","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/menu): add support for passing in data to the menu template\" (#25778)"},{"Id":"1405360392","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T06:08:15","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"25793","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix grammar nits in mdc migration guide","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25793","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix grammar nits in mdc migration guide\" (#25793)"},{"Id":"1405722092","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-12T05:30:53","Actor":"dileep999999","Number":"25794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with angular matdialog","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen we try to open a matdialog from the solution the _parentDialog is being set as empty object hence in the openDialogs()\r\nas the we have an empty object it is taking this._parentDialog.openDialogs which is being called in the getDialogById() where we are trying to find the value of a null item \r\n\r\nFix: in the openDialogs() please provide  a condition to check if there are any openDialogs \r\n\r\nreturn this._parentDialog && this._parentDialog.openDialogs ?

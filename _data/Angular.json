As per error logging this could recover most of customers random import failures, thus they probably barely noticed a failure and it recovered automatically after 2 seconds in the background. I can wrap all my own imports in that function but not the one angular generates.\n\n[From angular.dev](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/defer):\n\n> Angular's compiler produces a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) statement for each component, directive, and pipe used in the `@defer` block\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease allow to masque the imports generated by angular. Or maybe angular itself employs an import retry strategy. As per spec https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6768 sadly browsers cache import failures, so the retry function has to have a build-in cache buster.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPatching angular with yarn.\n\nI doubt - as long as angular uses esbuild - that the bundler will solve this, as this feature request has already been declined via https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2130\n\nWith webpack this issue was a little bit less pressing as at least the failures weren't cached. So the app was able to recover if you continued using it.

We’ve observed a discrepancy in component destruction behavior between Array-based columns and Complex column directives.\n\nFor array-based configurations, the component destruction lifecycle (ngOnDestroy) executes correctly, and the isDestroyed flag is set as expected.\n\nFor directive-based column definitions (nested components via ColumnDirective), the component destruction is not occurring as expected. The **ngOnDestroy** method is not triggered reliably for **nested directive** components, and as a result, we are unable to track or respond to destruction state changes.\n\nWe’ve provided a StackBlitz sample and a screenshot to illustrate the issue:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20ce3e09-4882-4d36-af6a-51a4f2f0789a)\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23093efb-7dcb-4599-b6d5-667caa85d148)\n\nsample : https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ejs-grid-aggregates-xegsuxcp?file=app.component.html,app.component.ts,app%2Fapp.module.ts\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nCreate a grid with nested ColumnDirective usage.\n\nModify or remove a column dynamically (e.g., uncheck a checkbox controlling visibility).\n\nObserve the behavior in lifecycle hooks like ngOnDestroy in nested components.\n\nCompare this with similar actions in array-based column definitions.\n\nActual Behavior :\n\nIn array-based columns: ngOnDestroy() is called correctly, and destruction is clean.\n\nIn complex column directives: destruction is not triggered, and the isDestroyed state is never updated.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nNested directive-based components (e.g., ColumnDirective) should also invoke ngOnDestroy() properly when removed from the DOM or destroyed via dynamic updates. The isDestroyed flag should be updated to allow consistent tracking.\n\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nCreate a grid with nested ColumnDirective usage.\n\nModify or remove a column dynamically (e.g., uncheck a checkbox controlling visibility).\n\nObserve the behavior in lifecycle hooks like ngOnDestroy in nested components.\n\nCompare this with similar actions in array-based column definitions.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nExpected Behavior:\n\nNested directive-based components (e.g., ColumnDirective) should also invoke ngOnDestroy() properly when removed from the DOM or destroyed via dynamic updates.

However, it seems that no fix has been implemented there yet, and the problem continues to affect developers relying on Angular CLI configurations.\n\n### Expected behavior\nCLI-generated components should always apply the schematic preferences defined in angular.json, regardless of the presence or order of third-party schematic collections.\n\n### Node Version\nv22.13.0\n### Angular CLI Version\n18.2.4\n### Cypress Schematic Version\n2.5.2\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nng new testproject\ncd testproject\nng generate component holi\nng add @cypress/schematic --e2e --component\nng generate component holi-two --skip-import\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.15\nNode: 22.13.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.13\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\n... forms, localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.15\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.15\n@angular/cli                    18.2.15\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.15\n@schematics/angular             18.2.15\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30165","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng generate component does not respect angular.json schematic settings when third-party schematics are installed\" (#30165)"},{"Id":"3014104162","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T13:55:49","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30164","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30164","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.\" (#30164)"},{"Id":"3011689684","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T11:51:23","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30148","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): generate libraries using TypeScript project references","State":"closed","Body":"When generating a project (via `ng generate library`), the created TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.lib.json`/`tsconfig.spec.json`) will be setup as composite projects and added as project references in the root `tsconfig.json`.

Here's an example (notice the change from `this` to `null`):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (async () => await foo())()\n        super()\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es2016)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (() => __async(this, null, function* () {\n          return yield foo();\n        }))();\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es2016)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (() => __async(null, null, function* () {\n          return yield foo();\n        }))();\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Some background: Arrow functions with the `async` keyword are transformed into generator functions for older language targets such as `--target=es2016`. Since arrow functions capture `this`, the generated code forwards `this` into the body of the generator function. However, JavaScript class syntax forbids using `this` in a constructor before calling `super()`, and this forwarding was problematic since previously happened even when the function body doesn't use `this`. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only forward `this` if it's used within the function body.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Fix memory leak with `--watch=true` ([#&#8203;4131](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4131), [#&#8203;4132](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4132))\n\n    This release fixes a memory leak with esbuild when `--watch=true` is used instead of `--watch`. Previously using `--watch=true` caused esbuild to continue to use more and more memory for every rebuild, but `--watch=true` should now behave like `--watch` and not leak memory.\n\n    This bug happened because esbuild disables the garbage collector when it's not run as a long-lived process for extra speed, but esbuild's checks for which arguments cause esbuild to be a long-lived process weren't updated for the new `--watch=true` style of boolean command-line flags. This has been an issue since this boolean flag syntax was added in version 0.14.24 in 2022. These checks are unfortunately separate from the regular argument parser because of how esbuild's internals are organized (the command-line interface is exposed as a separate [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/cli) so you can build your own custom esbuild CLI).\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;mxschmitt](https://redirect.github.com/mxschmitt).\n\n-   More concise output for repeated legal comments ([#&#8203;4139](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4139))\n\n    Some libraries have many files and also use the same legal comment text in all files. Previously esbuild would copy each legal comment to the output file. Starting with this release, legal comments duplicated across separate files will now be grouped in the output file by unique comment content.\n\n-   Allow a custom host with the development server ([#&#8203;4110](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4110))\n\n    With this release, you can now use a custom non-IP `host` with esbuild's local development server (either with `--serve=` for the CLI or with the `serve()` call for the API). This was previously possible, but was intentionally broken in [version 0.25.0](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.25.0) to fix a security issue. This change adds the functionality back except that it's now opt-in and only for a single domain name that you provide.\n\n    For example, if you add a mapping in your `/etc/hosts` file from `local.example.com` to `127.0.0.1` and then use `esbuild --serve=local.example.com:8000`, you will now be able to visit http://local.example.com:8000/ in your browser and successfully connect to esbuild's development server (doing that would previously have been blocked by the browser). This should also work with HTTPS if it's enabled (see esbuild's documentation for how to do that).\n\n-   Add a limit to CSS nesting expansion ([#&#8203;4114](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4114))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now fail with an error if there is too much CSS nesting expansion. This can happen when nested CSS is converted to CSS without nesting for older browsers as expanding CSS nesting is inherently exponential due to the resulting combinatorial explosion. The expansion limit is currently hard-coded and cannot be changed, but is extremely unlikely to trigger for real code. It exists to prevent esbuild from using too much time and/or memory. Here's an example:\n\n    ```css\n    a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{color:red}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n    ```\n\n    Previously, transforming this file with `--target=safari1` took 5 seconds and generated 40mb of CSS. Trying to do that will now generate the following error instead:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] CSS nesting is causing too much expansion\n\n            example.css:1:60:\n              1 │ a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{color:red}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n                ╵                                                             ^\n\n          CSS nesting expansion was terminated because a rule was generated with 65536 selectors. This limit\n          exists to prevent esbuild from using too much time and/or memory. Please change your CSS to use\n          fewer levels of nesting.\n\n-   Fix path resolution edge case ([#&#8203;4144](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4144))\n\n    This fixes an edge case where esbuild's path resolution algorithm could deviate from node's path resolution algorithm. It involves a confusing situation where a directory shares the same file name as a file (but without the file extension). See the linked issue for specific details. This appears to be a case where esbuild is correctly following [node's published resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together) but where node itself is doing something different. Specifically the step `LOAD_AS_FILE` appears to be skipped when the input ends with `..`. This release changes esbuild's behavior for this edge case to match node's behavior.\n\n-   Update Go from 1.23.7 to 1.23.8 ([#&#8203;4133](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4133), [#&#8203;4134](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4134))\n\n    This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain reports from vulnerability scanners that detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses, such as for CVE-2025-22871.\n\n    As a reminder, esbuild's development server is intended for development, not for production, so I do not consider most networking-related vulnerabilities in Go to be vulnerabilities in esbuild.

This results in a disabled scrollbar being shown in the app.\n\nAs a workaround, apps in this situation should ensure that they remove content they want to hide & wait for that change to be rendered in the DOM before launching the dialog.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30943","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): scroll blocking overlay persists when documentElement shrinks to the point it is not needed\" (#30943)"},{"Id":"3014712508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:17:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30940","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package","State":"closed","Body":"Note: this is the second attempt to merge this change, it now includes a fix for the documentation site which can be verified with the preview deployment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30940","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package\" (#30940)"},{"Id":"3014574843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:17:10","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30935","RawContent":null,"Title":" Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package","State":"closed","Body":"Note: this is the second attempt to merge this change, it now includes a fix for the documentation site which can be verified with the preview deployment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30935","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \" Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package\" (#30935)"},{"Id":"3014377743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:13:12","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30932","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/listbox): add cdk-active class","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30932","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/listbox): add cdk-active class\" (#30932)"},{"Id":"3014717485","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T17:09:49","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30941","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.\" (#30941)"},{"Id":"3014682769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:55:28","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30939","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release\" (#30939)"},{"Id":"3014678279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:51:41","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.\" (#30938)"},{"Id":"3014643488","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:43:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30937","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30937","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments\" (#30937)"},{"Id":"3014600091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:30:32","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30936","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30936","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments\" (#30936)"},{"Id":"3014554691","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:19:05","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30934","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: setup preview docs service","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30934","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: setup preview docs service\" (#30934)"},{"Id":"3014474891","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T15:40:19","Actor":"mrbreck","Number":"30933","RawContent":null,"Title":"Timepicker ignores provided moment adapter","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTimepicker is either not using the provided moment adapter or is ignoring the \"useUtc\" setting.

This has a number of positive consequences, such as batching updates from multiple sequenced events (bubbled events, `mousedown` / `mouseup` pairs, etc).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not without downsides / consequences, which this issue aims to capture:\r\n\r\n## APIs which require user interaction\r\n\r\n[Certain browser APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) must be called from a user interaction context. Usually this means either as the direct result of a user interaction (synchronously in the event handler) or in a microtask which resolves in the event handler.\r\n\r\nDeferring synchronization to a new macrotask breaks the connection to the original interaction event, meaning that these APIs cannot be used from contexts like component lifecycle hooks, input setters, effects, etc.\r\n\r\n## Task separation impacts scrolling behavior\r\n\r\nCertain rendering operations highlight an interesting edge case. For example, if a view is removed from a view container and replaced with another during the initial event (e.g. `click`), the view will not be fully rendered until the synchronization task (especially the creation of child embedded views from `@if`, `@for`, etc).\r\n\r\nAlthough the user will not see the intermediate state (Angular's scheduler guarantees the page will fully render before painting), it turns out that when elements are removed and the page layout changes, browsers recalculate the scrolling position immediately following that task. This means that browsers will update the scrolling position between the initial task and the synchronization task, based on the half-rendered layout of the page. This can lead to unexpected or sub-optimal scrolling behavior.\r\n\r\n* #57460","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57528","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Canonical: consequences of macrotask scheduling\" (#57528)"},{"Id":"2487249460","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-26T16:21:52","Actor":"BenoitZugmeyer","Number":"57527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow late instrumentation of `globalThis.fetch`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\nI am working on the [Datadog Browser SDK](https://github.com/DataDog/browser-sdk/), and we have customers having [issues](https://github.com/DataDog/browser-sdk/issues/2911) when using [`withFetch()`](https://angular.dev/api/common/http/withFetch).\r\n\r\nOur RUM SDK, like many other RUM solutions, is replacing the `fetch` global with an instrumented version (see [our code][1], [Sentry code][2], [OpenTelemetry code][3]). This works fine most of the time, but because Angular 18 is [storing a reference of the `fetch` global internally][4], users willing to use `withFetch()` **have** to load and initialize our SDK before starting their Angular app, else Angular will use the native `fetch` instead of our instrumented version. This is not ideal as it forces the Angular app to wait for our SDK to be loaded and initialized before starting.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/DataDog/browser-sdk/blob/e6f87a87c8f77fc2bb8f10747e1afe10f1e418f0/packages/core/src/browser/fetchObservable.ts#L53\r\n[2]: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/e6861cfd08addb1bd1b661067af539fec9e699f9/packages/utils/src/instrument/fetch.ts#L49\r\n[3]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2ca24594144253afa2bf7ee172bbfe1a1c58969d/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-fetch/src/fetch.ts#L480\r\n[4]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7a99815146eb78074aa3ed6db73c6e87042df692/packages/common/http/src/fetch.ts#L57\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nKeep using the global `fetch` variable.

Thus, the prototype chain of `Window` stays entirely within the jsdom, never crossing over into the Node.js realm.\n\nThis only occurs when `runScripts` is set to non-default values of `\"dangerously\"` or `\"outside-only\"`, as with the default value, there is no separate `Object.prototype` inside the jsdom.\n\nThis will likely not impact many programs, but could cause some changes in `instanceof` behavior, and so out of an abundance of caution, we're releasing it as a new major version.\n\n### [`v24.1.3`](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2413)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/24.1.2...24.1.3)\n\n-   Fixed calls to `postMessage()` that were done as a bare property (i.e., `postMessage()` instead of `window.postMessage()`).\n\n### [`v24.1.2`](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2412)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/24.1.1...24.1.2)\n\n-   Fixed an issue with the `in` operator applied to `EventTarget` methods, e.g. `'addEventListener' in window`, which only appeared in Node.js â‰¥22.5.0.

Right now, the only way to find these variables is by using the styles tab of developer tools.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNA\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNA\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29632","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Future of anular maetrial component\" (#29632)"},{"Id":"2482460487","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-23T10:32:44","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29630","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): stop manually instantiating MatRipple directive","State":"closed","Body":"Previously we had to manually instantiate `MatRipple` in order to maintain backwards compatibility, but it was problematic because it would break whenever we tried to use DI in `MatRipple` and it prevented us from switching to the `inject` function.\r\n\r\nInstantiating `MatRipple` is no longer necessary after #29622 so these changes switch to creating an internal `RippleRenderer` instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29630","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): stop manually instantiating MatRipple directive\" (#29630)"},{"Id":"2481921117","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-23T04:43:34","Actor":"jeffschulzusc","Number":"29629","RawContent":null,"Title":"Table ... click on element in a cell, also click on the row","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAngular Material Table ... at least v16 -> v18 \r\n\r\nif you have <tr (click)=\"_selectrow()\" ..> for example, then click element in <td><span>hello</span></td> and the click event propagates to the row ... so for example you can not select text for copy without also clicking the row \n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://v16.material.angular.io/components/table/examples\r\n\"Binding event handlers and properties to the table rows.\"\r\nTry to select text in a cell, you can not do it without the row click firing and you see in Click Log.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected that an element in a <td> shall act as if pointer-events: all at a z-index grater than the <tr>\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nClick on element in <td> also clicks the <tr>\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nNode   : 21.5.0\r\nOS     : darwin-arm64\r\nyarn   : 1.22.21\r\n\r\nnx (global)        : 18.0.6\r\nnx                 : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/js             : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/jest           : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/linter         : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/eslint         : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/workspace      : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/angular        : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/cypress        : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/devkit         : 18.0.6\r\n@nrwl/devkit       : 15.8.5\r\n@nx/eslint-plugin  : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/nest           : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/node           : 18.0.6\r\n@nrwl/tao          : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/web            : 18.0.6\r\n@nx/webpack        : 18.0.6\r\nnx-cloud           : 18.0.0\r\ntypescript         : 5.3.3\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nCommunity plugins:\r\n@ngneat/transloco    : 6.0.4\r\n@ngrx/effects        : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/entity         : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/router-store   : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/schematics     : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/signals        : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/store          : 17.0.1\r\n@ngrx/store-devtools : 17.0.1\r\n@nx-dotnet/core      : 1.22.0\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nThe following packages should match the installed version of nx\r\n  - @nrwl/devkit@15.8.5\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29629","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Table ... click on element in a cell, also click on the row\" (#29629)"},{"Id":"2480091877","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-22T20:44:15","Actor":"Farbfetzen","Number":"29621","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(tree): Replace deprecated NestedTreeControl in example code","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThe example code for the nested tree uses the [deprecated NestedTreeControl](https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/api#NestedTreeControl).

This made changing the forms abstractions in any way a challenging operation. Additionally, there were several import cycles involving this file and other parts of the forms system.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, `model.ts` is broken out into a number of files. Several strategies were used to effect this refactoring:\r\n\r\n * The interfaces of the main abstractions are interdependent, and are split out into a separate `model/api.ts` file.\r\n * Each interface is implemented by a private implementation class.\r\n * Constructors for each abstraction are defined with a separate constructor signature, and a `const` constructor declaration which is merged with\r\n   the interface type.\r\n * The `_find` operation, which previously depended on `instanceof` checks with the actual constructor types to achieve different behavior for different types of controls, has been refactored to rely on an internal method on the `AbstractControl` hierarchy instead.\r\n\r\nTogether, these changes will make the forms package much more maintainable, and pave the way for type-specific changes needed to strongly type the forms abstractions.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR was originally drafted by @alxhub, but I am shepherding it through review, since it will prepare typed forms for an easier API review.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: alxhub","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45168","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): split apart `model.ts`\" (#45168)"},{"Id":"1147450279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T22:55:36","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"45167","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add ariaCurrent input to RouterLinkActive directive","State":"open","Body":"add the ariaCurrent input to the RouterLinkActive directive so that\r\nusers can easily set the aria-current property to their active router\r\nlinks\r\n\r\nresolves #35051\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Same for the mandory super call for derived classes.\r\n\r\nBut in Angular it seems that this does not work. Angular always want the same constructor again and again for every derived class.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport abstract class AbstractMyService {\r\n  constrcutor(private anotherService: AnotherService) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\nexport class MyService extends AbstractMyService  {\r\n  /** no empty / useless constructor here. JS handles it. */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut Angular throws an error on runtime: \r\n\r\n> This constructor is not compatible with Angular Dependency Injection because its dependency at index 0 of the parameter list is invalid. This can happen if the dependency type is a primitive like a string or if an ancestor of this class is missing an Angular decorator.\r\n\r\nIt works only if I provide the \"useless\" constructor.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\nexport class MyService extends AbstractMyService  {\r\n  constrcutor(private anotherService: AnotherService) {\r\n    super(anotherService);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBtw. adding `emitDecoratorMetadata` to tsconfig does only change the error message, but does not fix the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular 12.x\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45155","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"This constructor is not compatible with Angular Dependency Injection because its dependency at index 0 of the parameter list is invalid.\" (#45155)"},{"Id":"1145686823","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T12:18:00","Actor":"clemthenem","Number":"45154","RawContent":null,"Title":"DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year. \r\nI thought that I messed up timezones etc. but even then, the result should be different.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\n<p>{{\"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" | date : 'MM/YYYY' }}</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns **01/2021** when we expect **01/2022**.\r\nSame problem with other formats like `dd/MM/YYYY` and different hours.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 12.2.16\r\nNode: 14.17.6\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.15\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.16\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1202.16\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.2.16\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.2.16\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.2.16\r\n@angular/cdk                    12.2.13\r\n@angular/google-maps            12.2.13\r\n@angular/material               12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular             12.2.16\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.3.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this error in various versions: 11, 12 and 13.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45154","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year.\" (#45154)"},{"Id":"1145568668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T09:57:35","Actor":"digeomel","Number":"45153","RawContent":null,"Title":"tslint replacement","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAlthough tslint is deprecated and the Angular team suggests switching to eslint, our team tried 3-4 times already to switch to the latter and it has always been painful. With the latest release of all packages, Angular 13, eslint 8.9.0, angular-eslint 13.1.0 and typescript-eslint 5.11.0, our project takes around 40 minutes 😱 to lint, which of course makes it impossible to integrate into any CI workflow. The experience is much better on individual files within vscode.\r\n\r\nI've read all the articles about improving the performance, and I tried some solutions without any result, but really, this is a tool that's supposed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration, we can't spend so much time trying to get it right, especially when tslint just worked.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I noticed that even the Angular and Angular Material teams haven't switched to eslint yet, you're both still on tslint. In fact, I couldn't find any Angular project of considerable size on github that has switched to eslint. Granted, I didn't expect to find any, because I guess Angular is used mostly in corporate environments, intranet applications and so on, so it's difficult to find code hosted on public repos.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSo, perhaps we should revisit the decision to drop tslint or suggest a better alternative? I don't have a suggestion of course, just pointing out the obvious issues.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to hear from people working on big Angular projects, especially with monorepo structures, multiple projects and libraries inside.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\neslint with angular-eslint.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tslint replacement\" (#45153)"},{"Id":"1145181465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T00:22:45","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"45152","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Greek localization for Angular Docs","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.14.23`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01423)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.22...v0.14.23)\n\n-   Update feature database to indicate that node 16.14+ supports import assertions ([#&#8203;2030](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2030))\n\n    Node versions 16.14 and above now support import assertions according to [these release notes](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/blob/6db686710ee1579452b2908a7a41b91cb729b944/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V16.md#&#8203;16.14.0). This release updates esbuild's internal feature compatibility database with this information, so esbuild no longer strips import assertions with `--target=node16.14`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from './package.json' assert { type: 'json' }\n    console.log(data)\n\n    // Old output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\";\n    console.log(data);\n\n    // New output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\" assert { type: \"json\" };\n    console.log(data);\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for CSS `@layer` rules ([#&#8203;2027](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2027))\n\n    This adds basic parsing support for a new CSS feature called `@layer` that changes how the CSS cascade works. Adding parsing support for this rule to esbuild means esbuild can now minify the contents of `@layer` rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        div {\n          color: yellow;\n          margin: 0.0px;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a{@&#8203;layer b {div {color: yellow; margin: 0px;}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b{div{color:#ff0;margin:0}}\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about `@layer` here:\n\n    -   Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/[@&#8203;layer](https://togithub.com/layer)\n    -   Motivation: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/cascade-layers/\n\n    Note that the support added in this release is only for parsing and printing `@layer` rules. The bundler does not yet know about these rules and bundling with `@layer` may result in behavior changes since these new rules have unusual ordering constraints that behave differently than all other CSS rules. Specifically the order is derived from the *first* instance while with every other CSS rule, the order is derived from the *last* instance.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-840-2022-02-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.3.0...v8.4.0)\n\n-   Added: \\[vue/quote-props].

Observe what get's focused\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect that when the modal is opened, it gets accessed first with key navigation\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen starting cycling with TAB key from the url bar, the page under the modal gets accessed first\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 12.2.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.9\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 98\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MODAL): If starting keyboard navigation from the URL bar - modal is not focused first!\" (#24443)"},{"Id":"1142157107","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-18T01:35:31","Actor":"lekhmanrus","Number":"24440","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/form-field): add color to default options (#24438)","State":"open","Body":"closes #24438","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24440","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/form-field): add color to default options (#24438)\" (#24440)"},{"Id":"1141578626","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-17T16:38:48","Actor":"GregorBiswanger","Number":"24439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mobile gestures support","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nI want to be able to open and close a sidenav via swipe on mobile devices.\r\n\r\nSome components have no touch support for mobile gestures.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24439","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mobile gestures support\" (#24439)"},{"Id":"1141404839","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-17T14:14:11","Actor":"infacto","Number":"24438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Extend MatFormFieldDefaultOptions with color.","State":"open","Body":"Setting color on every element: \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field color=\"accent\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be replaced by global setting in app module:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{ provide: MAT_FORM_FIELD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS, useValue: { appearance: 'fill', color: 'accent' } }\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extend MatFormFieldDefaultOptions with color.\" (#24438)"},{"Id":"1141159833","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-17T10:36:04","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24437","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/menu): allow for menu to be conditionally removed from trigger","State":"open","Body":"Adds support for conditionally removing the menu from a menu trigger by passing in `null`.\r\n\r\nFixes #24030.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24437","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/menu): allow for menu to be conditionally removed from trigger\" (#24437)"},{"Id":"1141132699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-17T10:11:40","Actor":"max-vogler","Number":"24436","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(matChipRemove): matChipRemove does not preventDefault()","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nmatChipRemove does not `preventDefault()`, allowing standard click behavior like following a parent hyperlink to trigger. matChipRemove does `stopPropagation()` though.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-va7p6c?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html\r\n```html\r\n<mat-chip-list>\r\n  <a href=\"https://example.org\">\r\n    <mat-chip>example.org <mat-icon matChipRemove>close</mat-icon></mat-chip>\r\n  </a>\r\n</mat-chip-list>\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nClicking on matChipRemove should fully consume the event, including `preventDefault()`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nClicking on matChipRemove triggers the parent hyperlink.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 12.2.9\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.9\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 98\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS 12.2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24436","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(matChipRemove): matChipRemove does not preventDefault()\" (#24436)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-02-23T03:30:03.3325258Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2347}

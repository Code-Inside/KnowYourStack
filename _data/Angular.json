In order for the tests to be compatible with the deployed version of the web-app (which gets deployed from the stable branch), the stable branch is checked out in git as part of the CI job.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we only checked out the `aio/` directory from the stable branch, leaving the rest of the code at master. This doesn't matter as long as the commands used to run the tests do not rely on code outside of `aio/`. However, it turns out that there _is_ code outside of `aio/` that affects the executed commands: It is our vendored version of yarn (in `third_party/github.com/yarnpkg/`), which overwrites the global yarn installed on the docker image on CI and must match the version range specified in `aio/package.json > engines`.\r\n\r\nUsing the yarn version checked out from the master branch with the `aio/` code checked out from the stable branch can lead to failures such as [this one][1].\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the problem by checking out both the `aio/` and `third_party/github.com/yarnpkg/` directories from the stable branch and re-running the steps to overwrite the global yarn executable with our own version from `third_party/github.com/yarnpkg/`. This ensures that the version of yarn used will be compatible with the version range specified in `aio/package.json > engines`.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nWe cannot checkout everything from the stable branch, since the CI config (`.circleci/config.yml` from the master branch) may try to run certain scripts (such as `.circleci/get-vendored-yarn-path.js`) that are not available on the stable branch. Therefore, we should only check out the necessary bits from the stable branch.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/567315","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34451","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci(docs-infra): fix failure in `aio_monitoring_stable` due to yarn version mismatch\" (#34451)"},{"Id":"539312913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T21:13:11","Actor":"camilogiraldo","Number":"34456","RawContent":null,"Title":"Form required validation ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/forms. maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was:  8.2.14\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nOur app is a dynamically generated form, with custom inputs using the `ControlValueAccessor` interface in order to bind those custom input changes to the main form.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3651787/71014994-d9e9a880-20c0-11ea-9803-33a4d4c76a0e.png)\r\n\r\nAfter some testing I found something interesting, if I remove the following snippet `[required]=\"kapInput.required\"` the error is gone.

The crux of the issue is that we were trying to use the `selectors` property of a component definition in 2 different code paths:\r\n* bootstrap;\r\n* dynamic instantiation.\r\n\r\nIt tuns out that selector should be interpreted differently for those 2 scenarios:\r\n* bootstrap: we need a selector as string (as written by a directive author);\r\n* dynamic instantiation: we need a tag name only (defaulting to `div` if a given selector doesn't contain tag name).\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the identified issue by clearly separating 2 usage scenario (and hence having 2 separate fields on a `ComponentFactory`: `selector` and `tagName`). Sadly this PR has one obvious issue - it doesn't _fully_ recreate a selector's string (as written by a user) - to do it properly we would have to add more code (non tree-shakable) to stringify a parsed selector in all cases.  \r\n\r\nSo it seems like we need to decide on the following trade-offs:\r\n* correctness (as in this PR);\r\n* fixed code size in the framework (fully re-create a selector string from its parsed version);\r\n* generated code size (we could add oryginal selector string to a directive definition). \r\n\r\nI'm leaning on the \"be correct and add more code to the framework) side, but opening a draft PR so we can discuss. \r\n\r\nFixes #34349\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34450","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): properly bootstrap components with attribute selectors\" (#34450)"},{"Id":"539149091","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T15:45:42","Actor":"xyfer","Number":"34449","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n: No translation found for \"<id>\" when doing ng build","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

An example is creating a dialog. I see that angular material has [schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics). It would be nice if there was something for a dialog:\r\n`ng generate @angular/material:dialog <component-name>`\r\n\r\nThis would generate a component like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef } from '@angular/material';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-aggregate-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './aggregate-dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./aggregate-dialog.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class AggregateDialogComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  private _dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>;\r\n  constructor(dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>, @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) data: any) {\r\n    this._dialogRef = dialogRef;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also mean the dialog component would be added to the `entryComponents` in the module.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nDescribe the use case(s) that the proposed feature would enable.\r\nFor dialog-heavy applications, setting up dialogs require quite a few steps. It would be nice if this was a little more streamlined. Given that (I believe) if you want to use an Angular Material dialog, it _requires_ it's own component I think it would be useful for the proper (or common) references to be added when generated. It sounds like the `entryComponents` step won't be needed in `v9`, so that is nice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Schematic for Angular Material Dialog\" (#17994)"},{"Id":"539113753","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T23:38:25","Actor":"devversion","Number":"17990","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: exclude devserver targets from ci test jobs","State":"closed","Body":"We don't want to build the runfile tree's for the executable\r\ndevserver targets.

Following code is doing this perfectly.\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return(\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#exampleModal\">\r\n        show Modal\r\n      </button>\r\n      <div className=\"modal fade\" id=\"exampleModal\" tabIndex={-1} role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"exampleModalLabel\" aria-hidden=\"false\">\r\n      Modal COde here\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nconst elements = document.getElementsByClassName('awvComponent');\r\nfor(var i=0; i< elements.length; i++ ){\r\n  ReactDOM.render(<App  />, elements[i]);\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I want to have the same implementation in angular.\r\n\r\nI have created the same functionality in angular 8.

For example: `mat-selection-list` and `mat-dialog` are focusable, but not expected to ever have click handlers. If we want focus indicators for these elements, we can add them in a follow-up PR.\r\n  * Chips will be in a follow-up PR. Focus indicator for chips likely requires an additional element.\r\n* The class `.mat-focus-indicator` was added to the appropriate elements within each component. Components with multiple focusable elements had `.mat-focus-indicator` added to multiple elements.\r\n  * For almost all components (besides the ones below), the class `.mat-focus-indicator` is added to the element that has focus (the actual `document.activeElement`).  Focus indicator is rendered when element has focus.\r\n  * For checkbox, radio, and slide toggle, the class `.mat-focus-indicator` is added to the associated `mat-ripple`. This is because the actual focused input is visually hidden and consequently does not have a bounding box to render the focus indicator on. Focus indicator is rendered when the class `.cdk-focused` is present on the parent checkbox/radio/slide toggle.\r\n  * For option, each `.mat-option` does not actually take focus as a user arrows through the options. Focus indicator is rendered when the option is active (i.e. when the class `.mat-active` is present).\r\n* The focus indicator itself is rendered on `.mat-focus-indicator::before`. The before pseudo-element is positioned absolutely. The `.mat-focus-indicator` element is positioned relatively.\r\n* For most components, the focus indicator has no inset/offset. For some components, the focus indicator does have inset/offset. This decision was made on a per-component basis. All components support inset focus indicators, not all components support offset focus indicators. FWIW, I believe that any component that *needs* to support offset focus indicators *does* support offset focus indicators.\r\n* All focus indicator CSS is decoupled from core CSS. Users must manually pull in `mat-strong-focus-indicators` and `mat-strong-focus-indicators-theme` mixins.\r\n* Focus indicator is either the primary color of the theme or a user-specified color. Some mechanism to invert the color will be added in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n**Some notes:**\r\n\r\n* What's nice about using the actual focused element as the host for the focus indicator (i.e. the host for the pseudo-element) is that SRs will also draw their focus indicators on this element. It's important that the actual focused element has an appropriate bounding box, and this feature helps to enforce that. I think this is really nice.\r\n* No new elements were added!\r\n* `position: relative` was added to 3 components. If this is a problem, make note. These changes can also potentially live within the focus indicator mixin.\r\n* Focus indicator appears on mouse click, which is weird. It shows up a little more frequently when using a mouse than I'd like. This is something we'll have to address in a future PR.\r\n* Have not tested on high contrast yet.\r\n\r\nI'll squash/rename my commits before merging to follow naming conventions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17966","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/*): First pass implementation of focus indicators.\" (#17966)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-12-18T05:30:05.6972407Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3079}

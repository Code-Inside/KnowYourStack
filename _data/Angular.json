However, using this option currently results in a TypeScript error:\n\n```\nERROR TS2769: No overload matches this call.\nThe last overload gave the following error.\nObject literal may only specify known properties, and 'timeout' does not exist in type '{ headers?: HttpHeaders | Record<string, string | string[]> | undefined; context?: HttpContext | undefined; observe?: \"body\" | undefined; params?: HttpParams | ... 1 more ... | undefined; ... 9 more ...; transferCache?: boolean | ... 1 more ... | undefined; }'. [plugin angular-compiler]\n```\n\n[TypeScript type definitions](https://angular.dev/api/common/http/HttpClient#api) have not been updated to reflect it.\n\nCode Example ([from the documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#timeouts)):\n\n```ts\nhttp.get('/api/config', {\n  timeout: 3000,\n}).subscribe({\n  next: config => {\n    console.log('Config fetched successfully:', config);\n  },\n  error: err => {\n    // If the request times out, an error will have been emitted.\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-tyswe3aa?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR TS2769: No overload matches this call.\nThe last overload gave the following error.\nObject literal may only specify known properties, and 'timeout' does not exist in type '{ headers?: HttpHeaders | Record<string, string | string[]> | undefined; context?: HttpContext | undefined; observe?: \"body\" | undefined; params?: HttpParams | ... 1 more ... | undefined; ... 9 more ...; transferCache?: boolean | ... 1 more ... | undefined; }'.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.1.0-rc.0...20.1.0)\n\nThere have been some internal mapping changes in Material 2 theme config maps generated by `mat.define-light-theme` and `mat.define-dark-theme`.\n\nIf your app was directly modifying these internal properties to alter styles, such as setting new color values used in the foreground and background palette maps, then your changes may no longer be applied to the components. The supported path for changing theme values is through each component’s overrides API.\n\nThe Material 2 component styles have undergone minor adjustments to enhance consistency across components and better align with the latest Material 2 specification. These changes result in a closer adherence to system-level colors such as `surface`, `background`, `disabled`, and `surface` variants. In general, these changes are slight hue differences for grey colors that aren’t very noticeable.\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Developers are forced to avoid adding any js/ts file to the polyfills array. Instead, they have to create js scripts inline inside index.html, or write js files, and include them as assets with index.html\n\n---\n\nThe problem is within these lines:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/2c3a46b9ecf69049fbddb2c912636d9d62e197df/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/utils.ts#L469-L478\n\nThe presence of *any* js/ts file in the polyfills array causes zone to be included, even though I uninstalled zone.js and do everything zone-less-ly.\n\nI had a file called `polyfill-buffer.ts` which I used to add to the polyfill array:\n```ts\nimport { Buffer } from 'buffer';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nNow I have to add it to index.html as a script\n```js\nimport { Buffer } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buffer/+esm';\n\nif (!globalThis.Buffer) {\n  Object.assign(globalThis, { Buffer });\n}\n```\n\nThis is maintainable for small scripts like these. But it eliminates the possibility of using any file-based polyfill stuff.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"incorrect detection of zoneless app\" (#30689)"},{"Id":"3217321980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T23:27:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30688","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30688","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.0 release\" (#30688)"},{"Id":"3217280453","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T22:37:36","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30687","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30687","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.0\" with changelog.\" (#30687)"},{"Id":"3217045505","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T21:17:24","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30686","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update Angular versions for 20.1 stable","State":"closed","Body":"The package versions for Angular related packages have been adjusted to reflect the stable release of Angular 20.1.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30686","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update Angular versions for 20.1 stable\" (#30686)"},{"Id":"3216835654","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T18:50:40","Actor":"teoeter","Number":"30685","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): add headless mode for vitest browser mode","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is not documented or clearly communicated, leading to a false sense of correctness.\n\n- Additionally, creating a project with a web worker generates a `tsconfig.worker.json`, which seems redundant because esbuild doesn't use it for type-checking. Also `builder` contains the `webWorkerTsConfig` option in the schema, as I understand it, this doesn't affect anything. This can confuse developers into thinking their web worker code is properly validated.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nEither esbuild-based builder should perform type checking on web worker files, or there should be clear documentation and/or warnings that type-checking is not performed on workers.\n\n**Current Behavior**\n\n- No build-time type checking for worker code.\n\n- Misleading tsconfig.worker.json is generated, giving false confidence in type safety.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new Angular project with esbuild (Angular CLI 18+).\n2. Add a web worker via ng generate web-worker.\n3. Introduce a type error in the worker file.\n4. Run ng build – no type error is reported.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAny version with esbuild bundler.\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30676","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Esbuild Web Worker Type Safety and Redundant tsconfig.worker.json\" (#30676)"},{"Id":"3212164625","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T06:57:33","Actor":"tirth-patel-0309","Number":"30670","RawContent":null,"Title":"withAppShell not working","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI can not able to setup the simple app-shell demo with angular version 20 for server side rendering.

Looking into it, that `i18n` hash is the same for **all** the chunks (in any locale) across a build and appears to be a SHA256 of all the localized dictionaries.\n\nSince at least a couple of strings are going to change across builds (we have ~14k strings in the app), this effectively means that the entire app is cache-busted on each deploy, leading to increased infrastructure costs and degraded client-side performance.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nMinimal repro is available here: https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-i18n-esbuild-bug\n\nSteps I performed:\n- `ng new`\n- `ng add @angular/localize`\n- Configured an `fr` locale in `angular.json`\n- Added some string in `app.ts`\n- Ran `ng extract-i18n` to extract the dictionary\n- Copied `messages.xlf` to `src/locale/messages.fr.xlf` \n- Ran `ng build --localize` to run the localized build\n\n```\nng build --localize\nInitial chunk files   | Names         |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nmain-BGVPYDPI.js      | main          | 221.57 kB |                61.67 kB\npolyfills-25EJAOGH.js | polyfills     |  36.97 kB |                12.41 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css   | styles        |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                      | Initial total | 258.54 kB |                74.08 kB\n\nApplication bundle generation complete.

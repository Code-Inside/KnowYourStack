When child application was created and `createCustomElemen()` was called right after ,js file with child element uploaded - user can easily create and render child element in some container of parent applications and no error occurs. But in that case we do not have an ability to provide our parent Injection context to the child app.\nIf move that application creation logic into parent application and load child one as a regular js module, it creates fine, but on attempt to render that component into view you will always face an error that `inject()` must be called inside Injection context because of Angular's StandaloneService:\n\n```typescript\n  static ɵprov = /** @pureOrBreakMyCode */ /* @__PURE__ */ defineInjectable({\n    token: StandaloneService,\n    providedIn: 'environment',\n    factory: () => new StandaloneService(inject(EnvironmentInjector)),\n  });\n```  \nIn second scenario that inject will be called outside of injection context for some reason and will throw an error.\n\n\nIn provided git link I've implemented 2 scenarios (you can switch them commenting in and out some lines). Main files to view is: `parent/src/app/app.component.ts` and `/child/src/web-component.ts`\n\nPiece of example:\nin parent application\n```typescript\n  private container = viewChild('customSelectorContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef });\n  private envInjector = inject(EnvironmentInjector);\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.loadScript().then(({ emConfig, emComponent }) => {\n      const customElement = createCustomElement(emComponent, { injector: this.envInjector });\n      customElements.define('child-app', customElement);\n\n      const childElement: HTMLElement = this.renderer.createElement('child-app');\n      // Here comes an error:\n      this.container()?.element.nativeElement.appendChild(childElement);\n    });\n  }\n\n  private loadScript(): Promise<{ config: ApplicationConfig, component: Type<any> }> {\n    const src = 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/dist/child/main.js';\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      const scriptElement = document.createElement('script');\n      scriptElement.src = src;\n      scriptElement.type = 'module';\n\n      let emConfig: ApplicationConfig;\n      let emComponent: Type<any>;\n\n      scriptElement.onload = () => {\n        import(src)\n          .then(({ emConfig: config, emComponent: component }) => {\n            emComponent = component;\n            emConfig = config ;\n            return this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => createApplication(config));\n          })\n          .then(appRef => resolve({ emConfig, emComponent }))\n      }\n      document.body.appendChild(scriptElement);\n    });\n  }\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/Dalantren/embedded-component\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR RuntimeError: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.

This made sense to ensure switching from `@Input` to `input()` was as seamless and non-breaking as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, a consequence of this choice is that a property binding to an input signal causes the receiving component to be marked for check even if the input signal is _not_ used in the template directly. For example, it could be used in a `computed` which might not actually change, or it may only be used to drive an `effect`. In those cases, it's unnecessary to check the template at all.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces logic to treat input signals differently in the binding path, and avoid marking components for check _purely_ when the input changes.

It is fairly straightforward.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nIn case the file input gets interacted with before hydration the `'change'` events will be captured by event replay. But my `'change'` event listener reads the most recent `files` property on the input element which got meanwhile reset by `writeValue()` by the time the captured event gets replayed.\n\nAs a result event replay is not working as expected and the form field basically gets reset during hydration as described in #53917.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince Angular already supports selecting function arguments with an expression I would like to propose using that expression to cache the function arguments when capturing an event.\n\nIn case of my example the flow would be like this:\n\n- The prerendered page loads with a pristine file input.\n- The user selects a file.\n- Event replay captures the `'change'` event **and evaluates the function argument selector `('$event.target.files ?? null')`**. It will cache the result.\n- The component taking care of the file input hydrates. It calls `writeValue()` with the initial value.\n- Event replay invokes the `'change'` event handler with the previously cached arguments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nFor now I'm using an internal boolean flag to avoid setting the initial value.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  #wroteFirstValue = false;\n\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    if (this.#wroteFirstValue) {\n      this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n    } else {\n      this.#wroteFirstValue = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nBut this only works because the `ControlValueAccessor` implementation knows it deals with a prerendered file input and the initial value is actually the native default value. I would prefer to have a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation which doesn't need to know anything about the outside conditions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60151","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Event replay could cache function arguments\" (#60151)"},{"Id":"2885710051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-27T22:07:51","Actor":"tsc036","Number":"60150","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: cleanup untracked in core","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

When implementing it, I noticed right away that it is missing a method to await the resource loading.  I'd expected the `reload()` method to be async, but all it does is kick off the reload process.  The use case is I have an app initializer which prefetches some data before the components bootstrap.  As far as I can tell, there isn't a way to force any `httpResource`es to finish loading during this process short of polling `isLoading`, so it can't be used during app initialization in a practical way.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMake HttpResource.reload() async or provide a new method to allow the resource to finish loading.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPolling `httpResource.isLoading` -- not a clean solution.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60146","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Need way to await httpResource loading\" (#60146)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2886284083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-02T22:40:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29724","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://redirect.github.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `3dd9d6c` -> `aae8ee3` |\n| [@angular/bazel](https://redirect.github.com/angular/bazel-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `fdef2cf` -> `8faa06d` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `cf7c3a1` -> `4a23657` |\n| [@angular/common](https://redirect.github.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `bcb5d90` -> `07b2ed0` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4917f41` -> `8a124b8` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `94cdc31` -> `4da970c` |\n| [@angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2b06800` -> `644795b` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://redirect.github.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `45bf1c8` -> `11773e4` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://redirect.github.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5815b7e` -> `0161392` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://redirect.github.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4a0e030` -> `e6e980b` |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b831fce` -> `153306d` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ab4151d` -> `7c787bc` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a9634e6` -> `73e9493` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fc2ea90` -> `68b1817` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4fd7f0c` -> `6dc7f38` |\n| [@angular/router](https://redirect.github.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7a81c2f` -> `a5247b8` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://redirect.github.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `9bdd36c` -> `310baaf` |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

results in empty component templates","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.3.0\n\n### Description\n\nA bugfix in webpack 5.96.0 has broken direct template loading.\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/19235#issuecomment-2688250063\n\nWhen using webpack 5.96.0 or higher, if you set the `directTemplateLoading` option to false in the `AngularWebpackPlugin`, component templates end up being empty.\n\nNote: I've said that this is a regression even though technically nothing in the Angular CLI has changed, however if you are updating the Angular CLI regularly, you are probably also updating webpack regularly, so you will encounter this bug.\n\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nStart with this repository: https://github.com/reduckted/repro-webpack-template\n\nThis is the setup:\n- Contains `AppComponent` that has a template with the content \"hello world\".\n- A custom Angular builder is used to modify the webpack configuration and set `AngularWebpackPlugin.options.directTemplateLoading` to false.\n- A custom loader is to the webpack configuration that replaces all occurrences of \"world\" with \"you\" in HTML files.\n\nWhen this works, the `AppComponent`'s template will end up containing \"hello you\".\n\nStart by cloning the repository:\n```\ngit clone

ng-webpack595\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\nOpen `dist/repro-webpack-template/main.js` and search for \"AppComponent_Template\". You will see that it looks like this:\n\n```js\ntemplate: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n  if (rf & 1) {\n    _angular_core__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"ɵɵtext\"](0, \"hello you\\n\");\n  }\n},\n```\n\nThis works correctly and has replaced \"world\" with \"you\".\n\n\nNow switch to the `ng-webpack598` branch (this uses webpack@5.98.0). and build:\n\n```\ngit checkout ng-webpack598\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOpen `dist/repro-webpack-template/main.js` again and search for \"AppComponent_Template\".

I only figured that out when I found the above PR. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70aed4e6-46c2-4676-a733-205514aa197d)\n\nI think it should be added back in.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30565","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Add back explanation about some prebuilt themes being M2 and some M3\" (#30565)"},{"Id":"2884950427","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-27T16:14:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30564","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-angular-io): sidenav links not updating","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the links in the docs sidenav weren't updating on navigation and avoids passing route parameters around.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30564","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material-angular-io): sidenav links not updating\" (#30564)"},{"Id":"2883574910","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-27T16:04:03","Actor":"laliconfigcat","Number":"30558","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Timepicker): Problem with MAT_TIMEPICKER_SCROLL_STRATEGY","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFirst of all, thanks for implementing the MAT_TIMEPICKER_SCROLL_STRATEGY so fast!\nI tried it with the newest version released yesterday and I run into a problem with it.\n\nI am using a close scroll strategy like this:\n```\nconst closeScrollStrategyFactory = (overlay: Overlay): (() => CloseScrollStrategy) => {\n  return () => overlay.scrollStrategies.close();\n};\n\n...\n\n{ provide: MAT_TIMEPICKER_SCROLL_STRATEGY, useFactory: closeScrollStrategyFactory, deps: [Overlay] },\n```\n\nWhen I open the Timepicker, it works fine but when the scrolling closes the Timepicker, it cannot be opened again.\n\nIs my scroll strategy wrong somehow?

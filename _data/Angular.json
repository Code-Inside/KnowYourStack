I am updating Angular from v16 to v18 now. And I have serious issue with [HammerGestureConfig](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/HammerGestureConfig).\r\n\r\n## I was using it below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\n@Injectable()\r\nclass HammerConfig extends HammerGestureConfig {\r\n  overrides = {\r\n    swipe: {direction: DIRECTION_ALL},\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...\r\n    {provide: HAMMER_GESTURE_CONFIG, useClass: HammerConfig},\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## and I got errors like this:\r\n```\r\nError: NG0200: Circular dependency in DI detected for RendererFactory2.

I debugged and I found a solution, but there is a problem.\r\n\r\nRemove `overrides` and provide `HAMMER_GESTURE_CONFIG` with only `HammerGestureConfig`. and also provide `HAMMER_LOADER` too.\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...\r\n    {provide: HAMMER_GESTURE_CONFIG, useClass: HammerConfig},\r\n    {provide: HAMMER_LOADER, useValue: () => import('hammerjs')},\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit works in short... but when route to another page(with another module like _detail.module.ts_), I got `ReferenceError: Hammer is not defined ` again. In the end, I solved it as below, but I don't know if it's right way.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// detail.module.ts\r\n// (I only use Hammerjs functions in detail.module, so I move providers from app.module to detail.module)\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...\r\n    {provide: HAMMER_GESTURE_CONFIG, useClass: HammerConfig},\r\n    {provide: HAMMER_LOADER, useValue: () => import('hammerjs')},\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class DetailModule {...}\r\n```\r\nIf I do this, I have to provide the same when using Hammerjs functions in other modules later. Could you please give me the right guide on Angular v18? Thanks.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please

CHANGES\n\n-   Add space token after blockquote and hr if there are multiple newlines\n-   Send token objects to renderers and move logic to parse tokens from the parser to the renderers.\n    -   Most extensions that update marked renderers should still work with this version but will break in a future major version.\n    -   Extensions that change marked renderers will need to be updated and use new option `useNewRenderer` and accept a token object instead of multiple parameters. See updated [Renderer docs](https://marked.js.org/using_pro#renderer)\n\n        ```js\n        // v12 renderer extension\n\n        const extension = {\n          renderer: {\n            heading(text, level) {\n              // increase level by 1\n              return `<h${level + 1}>${text}</h${level + 1}>`;\n            }\n          }\n        };\n\n        marked.use(extension);\n        ```\n\n        ```js\n        // v13 renderer extension\n\n        const extension = {\n          useNewRenderer: true,\n          renderer: {\n            heading(token) {\n              // increase depth by 1\n              const text = this.parser.parseInline(token.tokens);\n              const level = token.depth;\n              return `<h${level + 1}>${text}</h${level + 1}>`;\n            }\n          }\n        };\n\n        marked.use(extension);\n        ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

One, `browser-esbuild`, directly writes to the disk. The two experimental unit test builders also have unique requirements and also directly write. This leaves only the main `application` builder that relies on the internal file writing functionality of `buildApplicationInternal`. To avoid unneeded logic for the other usages (`dev-server`, `extract-i18n`, unit testing, etc.), the disk writing logic is now elevated to the `application` build itself. The internal function will now always provide the output files within the result objects generated from a successful build.

However even when you are using the default 'primary' styling of a select (as documented https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants) the background highlighting of the selected option in the select uses the secondary palette.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10 23 41 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435d9bfb-1856-41f3-a5a6-7839c92d1439)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis is a stackblitz forked from the `mat-select` documentation. It has been adjusted to use custom styles as produced by the output of `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` with the following colors: primary: `ff0000`, secondary: `00ff00`, tertiary: `0000ff`. The generated m3-theme.scss was copied over into that stack blitz and `m3-theme.$light-theme` was then used for `@include mat.all-component-themes(m3-theme.$light-theme)` in `styles.scss`\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/nngoxu-ggvcsg?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click to select element to open up the options list; note the background of the selected element is miscolored\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the selected background color of a given palette to either be static (as in M2's `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)`) or to be based on the colors in the palette chosen to style that component.\r\n\r\nPossible work arounds:\r\n* Use material provided palettes (ie mat.$red-palette). \r\n* Use a secondary color / palette that is produced as a variant the primary color / palette.\r\n* Set the css variable `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color`. \r\n\r\nFor my code I went with option 3; `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);`. Note for option 3, as this is styling something in a `cdk-overlay-container` you have to make sure that your override still applies. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe background color of a 'primary' (default) styled select appears to be using the color as specified in the secondary palette at the '90' level. This 'works' when you use the included scss material palettes because the 'secondary' palette is bundled as a subelement of that palette. A trimmed version of the 'rose' palette (rose/red is one of the styling options on the angular material page), as found in @angular/material/core/themeing/_palettes.scss looks like \r\n\r\n```\r\n/// Rose color palette to be used as primary or tertiary palette.\r\n$rose-palette: _apply-patches((\r\n  0: #000000,\r\n  10: #3f001b,\r\n  <... color levels ...>\r\n  secondary: (\r\n    <... color levels ...>\r\n    90: #ffd9e1, // this is what the selected element actually uses on material.angular.io when using the 'Rose and Red' theme\r\n    <... more color levels>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral: (\r\n    <... color levels...>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral-variant: (\r\n     <... color levels ...>\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n```\r\nSo even for the documentation stylings all of the secondary palettes are mutated forms of the primary palettes and so the selected element's background looks good. When using the `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` no such binding between the primary palette & secondary palette is implied or generated. So when it selects a secondary.90 for styling the background of a primary styled mat-select component it looks wrong.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/select): Material 3 mat-selects use the secondary color for selected item backgrounds (when the component is styled to primary)\" (#29553)"},{"Id":"2453953658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T17:11:00","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29552","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tree): switch example to signals","State":"open","Body":"The example currently fails to remove the progress bar due to change detection not being triggered even though isLoading is set to false","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29552","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/tree): switch example to signals\" (#29552)"},{"Id":"2450313698","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T16:34:57","Actor":"krzysztofpiotrow","Number":"29545","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(sidenav/drawer/focustrap): over/push mode do not remove tabindex=\"0\" when drawer closed","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using mat-sidenav or mat-drawer with mode over or push (and might need backdrop=true) there is a div element:\r\n`<div class=\"cdk-visually-hidden cdk-focus-trap-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>`\r\nwhich always has tabindex=\"0\" added to it but should get it only when the sidenav/drawer is opened. \r\nAs a result tabbing through the page is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/e4bsuu?file=package.json\r\nStackBlitz was forked from the second example here: [SideNav Examples](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/examples)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Before choosing it, moving to it or sticking with it, one needs to evaluate its quality / development status. Even if comparisons with alternatives may be ideal, having a rough idea of Angular's own quality would already help a lot._\r\n\r\nWhile Angular's ITS tracks lots of issues, unfortunately, the project is way too large to efficiently analyze even a small representative sample of its tens of thousands of issues. [The _Issues_ page](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues) shows a list with countless pages. As I write these lines, the one shown by default links to ticket #47905 , which at first sight may not even report an actual Angular issue. On the other hand, top actual issues like #45272 do not feature on that first page at all.\r\n\r\nBasically, the sort is random (newest tickets are listed first), and while other sorts are available, none really helps with evaluation.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBy far the best solution would start by migrating to a proper ITS engine. Most importantly, mature engines provide:\r\n\r\n- a way to set a (quite approximate) importance for each issue\r\n- tracking of ticket validity\r\n- tracking of issue resolution\r\n\r\nAtlassian Jira and JetBrains Youtrack are certainly the first options to evaluate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both of these are proprietary. Bugzilla is another option which is well ahead of GitHub, but - being written in Perl - may never reach maturity.\r\n\r\nOnce tickets have been migrated, triage of ideally all tickets is of course needed to take advantage of these new possibilities and enable more meaningful sorting and filtering.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAdding a page to the documentation treating Angular's status could also help. Such a page could link to the most important issues.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, GitHub provides a way to [\"pin\" a few issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository), allowing a most basic distinction between the very worst issues and... all the rest.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47914","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"No efficient way to evaluate quality/status\" (#47914)"},{"Id":"1427293699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-31T09:30:44","Actor":"jmwierzbicki","Number":"47905","RawContent":null,"Title":"Looking for a way to access/modify angular template parser","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler, core, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-browser, platform-server\n\n### Description\n\nHello.

Recently we also found that sometimes our translation logic fails, as there might be some whitespaces trimmed by default.

The ng generate schematic did the opposite, although since the typography levels have changed for MDC, this would show an error in the console and break the typography configurations when overriding. This change just leaves the `define-legacy-typography-config` function call and adds a TODO comment to update the typography levels when values are being overriden.

Only a few milliseconds to prevent flashing menus when you just move the mouse around. The user can still click on a nested item to trigger the menu instantly. This will improve the UX. It's really annoying if the menus are flashing.\r\n\r\nYou can test my suggested behavior in other proven menus like in Windows 10. Just open a folder and open the context menu. You'll see that the nested menus don't open immediately. They are delayed. Same behavior in VSCode. A shorter delay than the Windows menus, but they are delayed.

Not just boolean).\r\n\r\nBtw: Another related issue which is about delay before closing: #24476\r\nWe could combine both issues to add delay before and after.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is more a bug than a feature. An unwanted behavior / bad UX. But anyway, it's no candidate for votes.

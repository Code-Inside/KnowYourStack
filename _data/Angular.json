But the CSS is not:\n\n```css\n.foo[_ngcontent-foo:bar-c2846697727] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nThis is invalid because `:` triggers a pseudo-class in the middle of an attribute selector. Ideally, we should escape this with `CSS.escape`, though a similar problem exists with the attribute name itself. For example, `foo bar` triggers\n\n```\nInvalidCharacterError: Failed to execute 'setAttribute' on 'Element': '_nghost-foo bar-c2846697727' is not a valid attribute name.\n```\n\nI'm not sure you really can escape a space from an attribute name, so we might just have to ban that (and any other invalid characters such as `>`) altogether.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-74rnmosz?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63251","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Escape `APP_ID` for `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`\" (#63251)"},{"Id":"3335525534","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-19T20:01:27","Actor":"10kc-emilyk","Number":"63250","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fetch backend: error does not include `text`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn the XHR backend, when a JSON parse error occurs, `HttpErrorResponse`'s `.error` is a [`HttpJsonParseError`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b7f2a8b1809e710f6238675239fdd1c2e4389736/packages/common/http/src/response.ts#L131-L134).

I expected to find documentation about the `rejectErrors` option or at least a note that it has been removed.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n1.

rendered via `ViewContainerRef`, that are animated in one place, you can do it using `query(':enter')` and `query(':leave')` with old API and define it only once in code. You can easily reuse this animation.\n\nBut if you want to do this in new animation API, its not possible. I think `query(':enter')` can be done by using `@starting-style`, but there is no way to animate leaving component, so `query(':leave')` has no alternative in new API. Workaround for this would be define it on `AbComponent` and also on `CdComponent` but you have to have it already in two places and if number of these components is much higher, then you will have to repeat this code in every component which is not good for clean code. I hope at least you would be able to use `hostDirectives` with definition of host (i have not tried it yet) so you will only repeat usage of this directive but still it requires changes in every component.\n\nThis also applies for `RouterOutlet`, i know there are page transitions, but these are not supported for Firefox yet. But old animation API works perfectly even in Firefox.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.2.0-rc.1\nNode: v22.16.0\nPackage manager: NPM 10.9.2\nOS: Windows 11\n\nAngular: 20.2.0-rc.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63238","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"BUG/Feature: support for query(:leave), query(:enter) in new animation API\" (#63238)"},{"Id":"3333346667","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-19T12:34:11","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63233","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove patch-package dependency","State":"closed","Body":"This a patch backport of #63126\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63233","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: remove patch-package dependency\" (#63233)"},{"Id":"3333568206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-19T12:33:27","Actor":"JulienZD","Number":"63237","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use correct closing quote in `input` and `model` import usage notes","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example `resource` and `linkedSignal` both use multiple signal APIs under the hood.\n\nAngular DevTools only sees the raw reactive graph, and so it displays the raw signal primitives rather than a single `resource` or `linkedSignal`. For example, I believe `resource` creates an effect for making the network request and then updates an internal signal. There's also multiple computeds for things like `hasError`.\n\nThis might be WAI from the perspective that it is more representative of what is actually happening. `resource` is not a single reactive value, and we should not mislead developers into thinking it is.\n\nCC @JeanMeche @AleksanderBodurri @milomg\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThere are two potential improvements we can make though:\n\n1. Improve `debugName` so it is clear the composed signal primitives originate from a single user-defined `resource` or `linkedSignal`.\n2. Create a visual \"group\" of signal nodes under a specific `resource` or `linkedSignal`.\n\nI'm thinking that the graph would initially just treat a `resource` as a single reactive node and any dependency on `value` or `hasError` would point to that same node. But then when the user clicks on the node, they can expand it to show all the internal signal primitives (with appropriate names) and the dependency graph adjusts to depend on the specific internals it needs. This allows developers to get a high-level view up front while still supporting the more specific details when it becomes relevant to them.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. We could hide signal internals altogether and _only_ show `resource` / `linkedSignal` as a single reactive node, but this could be misleading to developers and potentially impede debugging efforts.\n2.

The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThis should work out of the box as ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDOM is a built-in feature of Angular and this package cannot be said to be complete without supporting it.\n\nAnother option could be to add a warning to ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDOM that it's not feature complete for SSR.\n\nSince 2015 there's been a wide support for declarative shadow DOM in all browsers and similar features have been implemented in other SSR libraries.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n``` ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-shadow-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: '<h2>This should be RED</h2>',\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom,\n  styles: 'h2 { color: red }',\n})\nexport class

HTML was rendered as if encapsulation was emulated, but the respective CSS was added to the head \"as is\" and consequently was applied incorrectly.\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n> ng

The Karma runner is now marked as `isStandalone: true` to indicate that it manages its own build process. The Vitest runner now uses the `getBuildOptions` hook to provide its build configuration to the main builder.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): introduce internal generic test runner API in unit-test builder\" (#30938)"},{"Id":"3329386117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T12:38:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30941","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove version 20 migrations","State":"closed","Body":"This commit remove the non optional migrations for version 20 as these have already been executed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30941","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove version 20 migrations\" (#30941)"},{"Id":"3329460356","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T11:19:27","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30942","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

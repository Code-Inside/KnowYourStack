The unit tests run can run in either Chrome or jsdom. I need jsdom because my CI environment doesn't have Chrome (org policy: no browsers on servers).\r\n\r\nAngular CLI 15.1.4 introduced a change in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24620 wherein Javascript bundles are loaded as modules. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, jsdom doesn't support <script type=\"module\">; it simply doesn't load the module scripts. This is a known issue in jsdom - https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2475\r\n\r\nIdeally jsdom would add module support; but since that ticket has been open for four years, I'm not holding out much hope. So instead, here's my request:\r\n\r\n**REQUEST:** Could Angular CLI add a flag to add/omit type=\"module\" ?\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is patching jsdom (using patch-package) to ignore the type attribute on <script type=\"module\">.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nClone my git repo: https://github.com/andrewpmontgomery/angular-15-jsdom\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n2. Run `npm run test:chrome` and all three tests should pass.\r\n3. Run `npm run test:jsdom` and it should time-out.\r\n4. Run `npm run patch-package`\r\n5. Run `npm run test:jsdom` again and now it works.\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.2.0\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24778","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI 15.1.4 breaks ng test with jsdom because CLI is loading JavaScript bundles as module\" (#24778)"},{"Id":"1598710153","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T14:43:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24777","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: refactor circular-deps-test.conf to use package.js file","State":"closed","Body":"This ensures that all packages are picked up.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24777","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: refactor circular-deps-test.conf to use package.js file\" (#24777)"},{"Id":"1598471575","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T11:46:35","Actor":"ziedzayani","Number":"24775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone migration failed with basic application","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI created a new application with Angular CLI 15.2.0.

In the MDC version (at version 15) of Angular Material, using `ng-container` within a button has an effect on the rendered DOM.\r\n\r\nThese expectations are based off of the Angular documentation, as well as my experience with previous versions of Angular Material. This issue was noticed while migrating an existing app to MDC.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Load this stackblitz in a Chromium based browser: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-1fvgpn?file=src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.ts\r\n2. Observe the difference between the disabled button and the enabled button. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the disabled button (no `ng-container`) and the enabled button (with `ng-container`) to have the same visual appearance and the same DOM structure, since `ng-container` was used to host the `NgIf` directive.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nUsing `NgIf` on an `ng-container` that contains a `MatIcon` within a `MatButton` is effecting the rendered DOM structure. The disabled button's innerHTML has the `mat-icon` rendered as a direct child of the `button`. The enabled button renders the `mat-icon` within the `span.mdc-button__label` element, as a \"grandchild\" of the `button`.\r\n\r\nThis difference in DOM structure leads to an inconsistent visual appearance that is challenging for library consumers to style away. I believe this breaks the expectations of the `NgContainer` API.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: ~15.2\r\n- CDK/Material: ~15.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chromium\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button): `ng-container` element is effecting the rendered DOM structure when used with `mat-icon` in `mat-button` template's innerHTML\" (#26714)"},{"Id":"1604964502","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-01T13:19:14","Actor":"liesahead","Number":"26713","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-checkbox): indeterminate state is not reflected in component classlist anymore.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nV14\n\n### Description\n\nV14\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32300784/222149828-ccfcb6b7-8847-48fe-b5ed-420800943a36.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV15\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32300784/222149742-8a905787-8d6f-4264-958e-cee8f3160a7d.png)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

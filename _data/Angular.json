But the bug is there nonetheless.\r\n\r\nIf form is submitted and you listen to the submit event, say, as a `(click)` on submit button — it is fired before `ngSubmit`. In that case, if you do something that would cause form to be gone from DOM (like `*ngIf=\"!submitted\"`), it would stop listening to `submit` event and will not call `.preventDefault()`. This would cause the page to reload as a default form submit action.\r\n\r\nThis can be remedied by listening to `submit` event in capture phase inside `ngSubmit`, this way it would be triggered before any other listener and prevent the default behavior.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wzkwqq\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to fix it because Angular does not provide an idiomatic way to listen to events in capture phase. I have circumvented that in my project because I use my library for custom event plugins that allows it:\r\nhttps://github.com/Tinkoff/ng-event-plugins/blob/master/projects/ng-event-plugins/src/plugins/options.plugin.ts\r\n\r\nI wonder if we can have a discussion about including it in vanilla Angular? These plugins are pretty straightforward, and I'm sure ability to write `(click.stop)` or `(submit.capture)` out of the box would be welcomed by the community. But these are just a thoughts outside this actual issue.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50407","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"If form is removed from DOM during submit callback the page is reloaded\" (#50407)"},{"Id":"1718235888","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-22T15:04:05","Actor":"chandra1011","Number":"50384","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update NAMING.md","State":"closed","Body":"A small doc change tried.

The function brings the necessary providers and as a result, the code is included eagerly (the code gets added to the main bundle). However, in vast majority of cases, animations happen on user interaction and animations code is not needed immediately on page load. It'd be beneficial for initial page load if animations code can be deferred and be loaded asynchronously (i.e. code is excluded from the main bundle). There is also a related issue #20002, which talks about `NoopAnimationsModule` bringing a lot of code too. There is a chance that with some refactoring we can drop direct references to symbols that represent animation providers (instead, making them tree-shakable), so the size of the `NoopAnimationsModule` may go down.\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to explore a solution like this:\r\n\r\n- we can consider adding a new function (like `provideAnimationsAsync`)\r\n- the function would register a renderer (similar to how it works today), but the renderer would have the following logic:\r\n  - by default it delegates to the currently configured renderer\r\n  - if there is a component that has animations metadata (this info should be available at runtime) being initialized, start loading animations code (via dynamic import). We could consider doing it within `requestIdleCallback`.\r\n  - once the code is loaded, route calls to that loaded renderer (instead of delegating to the parent renderer)\r\n- this change would also require making `SHARED_ANIMATIONS_PROVIDERS` ([here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/animations/src/providers.ts#L43)) tree-shakable, so that there are no direct references to the symbols that bring a lot of code alongside with them. This item could also improve tree-shaking for the `NoopAnimationsModule` (which shouldn't reference those symbols, hence they should be tree-shaken away). This is probably the first item to look at, because if it's not feasible, other improvements describe above would bring only minor benefits (and may not worth adding extra complexity).\r\n\r\nNote: the described approach is not entirely new in the codebase, we perform a similar lazy-loading for Hammer library, [see here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/events/hammer_gestures.ts#L164). However, dynamic renderer delegation is something that we'd need to explore (there are no examples in the codebase).\r\n\r\n// cc @jessicajaniuk @JeanMeche in case you have some thoughts on this","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50399","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Research lazy loading of Animations package code\" (#50399)"},{"Id":"1718554666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T16:06:41","Actor":"shavidze","Number":"50397","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix code-example header path in dependency-injection-in-action-md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Therefore the `height` should rather `inherit` the height from the button instead of its own fixed height.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the surrounding layout container calculates the height of the button as `36px`. The button don't fit into and an `overflow` appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe provided sample container could be adjusted with the proper css attributes. Nevertheless the problem persists in some other configurations especially when the minimal height is calculated wrongly.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/nxq1bh?file=src/app/button-overview-example.css\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-unelevated-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-raised-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-outlined-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 50%;\r\n    height: inherit; /* <=================== */\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-unelevated-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-raised-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target, .mat-mdc-outlined-button .mat-mdc-button-touch-target {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 50%;\r\n    height: 48px;  /* <=================== */\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.2\r\nNode: 20.1.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1600.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      16.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core               16.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         16.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                       16.0.1\r\n@angular/material                  16.0.1\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   16.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular                16.0.2\r\ntypescript                         4.9.5\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27118","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Button - touch height\" (#27118)"},{"Id":"1714745959","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-17T22:45:49","Actor":"clamli","Number":"27115","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/core/option): allow set role for MatOption","State":"open","Body":"This change enables clients to pass a role value to MatOption.

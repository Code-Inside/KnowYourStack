The responsibility of displaying error state requires leaning on additional control-flow syntax within the template.\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n      @if (!whenSuccess().error) {\r\n        <div>\r\n          Success\r\n        </div>\r\n      } @else {\r\n        <div>An error occured</div>\r\n      }\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error {\r\n      <div>Failed to load the defered js</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `} error {}` is not intuitive; `error` should simply allow for user-defined error-states in addition to failing to fetch scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nProposed solution is to allow the error statement to utilize `when` similar to `defer`'s `when` statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error (whenSuccess().error) {\r\n      <div>{{ whenSuccess().error }}</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution to use `@if {} @else {}` is explored above.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Extend defer's error statement to include `when` semantics\" (#52196)"},{"Id":"1942854347","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-14T01:26:58","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"52208","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler-cli): compile signal inputs","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds the compiler mechanisms for signal inputs, without a runtime implementation.\r\n\r\nConspicuously missing here is a template type-checking implementation.

This has several benefits including allowing different bundling options for the polyfills and minimizing rebundling of polyfills (which rarely change) in watch/serve mode. Along with this change, the polyfill bundling options have been adjusted to not externalize packages when in development server mode. This allows the zone.js globals to be more easily used as well as minimizing the need for Vite to process a typically unchanging output file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26027","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): bundle polyfills independent of main code in application builder\" (#26027)"},{"Id":"1941513552","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T08:41:13","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26033","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): resolve and load sourcemaps during prerendering to provide better stacktraces","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nWith this commit we running a build with sourcemaps enabled we enable Node.js Sourcemap support for stack traces.

This means, that once Angular v17 is out, one would be forced to use the mdc-based components only.\r\n\r\nWhile this might have been a reasonable choice for your team - also conforming to your update and deprecation policies - there are codebases out there (including ours) that haven't migrated to the new components yet.\r\nReasons for that are probably diverse, but one major reasons for us was the knowledge about your efforts on eventually offering a brand-new token-based theming API.\r\n\r\nWe work on a bigger enterprise grade application with a design system that's based on customized material components. Due to limited official support for customizations on the current theming API (as of v16 with legacy components) , we tend to override a lot of (global) component styles.\r\nWhile eagerly waiting for the new token-based theming API to evolve and stabilize, we hoped to have the chance to upgrade directly to this new theming API, component by component.\r\nWith the discontinued support of legacy components in v17 however, this is now impossible and our migration path to the mdc-based components is very steep (either high effort or high risk).\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI can only see 2 options for us to move forward right now:\r\n\r\n1. While staying on v16, migrate each legacy component to the new mdc-based ones, component by component. This will require us to integrate with a new but still not latest theming API of the mdc-components first. After that migration is completed we would upgrade to v17 and have to re-integrate with the latest theming API once more, resulting in doubled theme integration effort. (high effort)\r\n2. Upgrade to v17 and migrate to mdc-based components at the same time. This would require us to migrate all components at once, which would tremendously increase the risk of the migration. However, we would only need to integrate with the latest theming API once.

However, if the user selects a new year fast enough the datepicker is still opening and animating (_isAnimating is true) and therefore the datepicker is not closed.  This was introduced in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25843\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `_isAnimating` property and the `_animationDone` subject are both not exposed through public API so we cannot wait for the animation to be finished to close the picker. However, exposing it would be not a good solution as this would require us to have knowledge of the internals of the component to implement the solution. Rather, the datepicker should be fixed so the close event is scheduled for after when the animation is finished.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nIt simulates opening the datepicker and then closing it very fast through setTimeout to visualize the issue.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/datepicker-bug-material\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nEither datepicker will close even if animating or datepicker will be scheduled for closing so it closes at the end of the animation.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nDatepicker is not closing while animating\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.2.8\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 117.0.5938.149  - all browsers.\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs 13.2.1  - all operating systems\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27920","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-datepicker): Datepicker cannot be closed when animating\" (#27920)"},{"Id":"1930774687","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T19:13:35","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"27917","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrate snapshots jobs to GHA","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27917","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Migrate snapshots jobs to GHA\" (#27917)"},{"Id":"1930810132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T19:13:27","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"27918","RawContent":null,"Title":"Complete migration to GHA","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27918","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Complete migration to GHA\" (#27918)"},{"Id":"1930164736","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T13:14:06","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27915","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `2807276` -> `6e0fdac` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `16b9f55` -> `f128af3` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `fb30926` -> `c4a2ff4` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

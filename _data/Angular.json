Ivy applies this approach\r\nto all of its template type-checking, including the DOM schema checks which\r\nvalidate whether an element is a valid component/directive or not.\r\n\r\nView Engine has both the basic and the full mode, with the same distinction.\r\nHowever in View Engine, DOM schema checks happen for the full template even\r\nin the basic mode.\r\n\r\nIvy's behavior here is technically a \"fix\" as it does not make sense for\r\nsome checks to apply to the full template and others only to the top-level\r\nview. However, since g3 relies exclusively on the basic mode of checking and\r\ndevelopers there are used to DOM checks applying throughout their template,\r\nthis commit re-enables the nested schema checks even in basic mode only in\r\ng3. This is done by enabling the checks only when Closure Compiler\r\nannotations are requested.\r\n\r\nOutside of g3, it's recommended that applications use at least the full mode\r\nof checking (controlled by the `fullTemplateTypeCheck` flag), and ideally\r\nthe strict mode (`strictTemplates`).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38943","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler-cli): perform DOM schema checks even in basic mode in g3\" (#38943)"},{"Id":"707626952","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-23T19:34:24","Actor":"yefim","Number":"38962","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Element DOM node is removed from DOM when an Angular Element is readded/reconnected","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n@angular/animations\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs described by @kseamon in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38778#issuecomment-690715758, when an Angular Element is removed from the DOM then later re-added, the animation engine removes the custom element which destroys the component again.

But please not that the final outcome of this is effectively the same as translation at compile time. The translation happens only once; if you want to change the language at runtime then you must restart the whole application (e.g. via a reload). This has the benefit of allowing the project to deploy a single distributable with numerous translation files, which is helpful in a small number of use cases where you do not want to generate all the different translations up front.\"\r\n\r\nTo give you a scenario, we are building Ionic apps using Angular so the \"allowing the project to deploy a single distributable with numerous translation files\" would be a great benefit to us. We are OK with reloading the app, although some built-in way to do this as the app bootstraps (or soon after) would be great to avoid workarounds etc..\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nA single build/bundle with the ability to switch locales at runtime via a seamless reload of the app. Seamless means a way to reload the correct locale app at the early possible time based on either device info, user input, and/or locale storage (realizing that would be app specific code but some built-in hook would be great).\r\n\r\nSince we already do the translations \"up front\" via xliff files, some way of hooking into those translations would be awesome. Without know the internals of Angular, a possible design for this is a single build in `/dist` with the translations (originating from the xliff files) distributed to `dist/<locale>`, with the `/dist` root defaulting to the `sourceLocale` in angular.json. Possibly there is an index.html file in each `dist/<locale>` that when requested by the web browser gets the main bundles from `/dist` but \"swaps\" the locale code from the current `dist/<locale>` folder request. I could be way off here :).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nWe will have to distribute all full locale builds on the device and manually reload via code (don't have a sample of this just yet).

However, checkboxes or select inputs are inherently different from text inputs in one specific way: frequency of value changes, with the latter receiving significantly more.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be nice if individual form controls could easily be debounced such that their valueChange emits less frequently. This is opposed to debouncing the entire FormGroup's valueChange which would unnecessarily debounce these other controls as well.\r\n\r\nI maintain a library, [ngqp](https://github.com/TNG/ngqp) which uses the forms infrastructure to wire up form controls with query parameters, and there I have this feature implemented and got the inspiration from to make this feature request.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAn addition to AbstractControlOptions such that this can be done:\r\n\r\n```\r\nformBuilder.control('', {debounceTime: 100});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTechnically this can already be achieved by splitting the valueChange observable using distinctUntilChanged etc. and merging it back, but that requires quite a bit of effort. If this could be a configuration on the form control itself, however, users would have a simple, declarative solution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis request is related to and possibly a duplicate of #19705, but that request is specifically about template-driven forms while I am focusing on reactive forms here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38936","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Debounce individual form controls\" (#38936)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"707858954","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-24T05:11:52","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18866","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update bazel packages","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@bazel/buildifier](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) | devDependencies | minor | [`3.4.0` -> `3.5.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fbuildifier/3.4.0/3.5.0) |\n| [@bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`2.0.3` -> `2.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fjasmine/2.0.3/2.2.0) |\n| [@bazel/typescript](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`2.0.3` -> `2.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2ftypescript/2.0.3/2.2.0) |\n| [build_bazel_rules_nodejs](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | http_archive | minor | [`2.0.3` -> `2.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/build_bazel_rules_nodejs/2.0.3/2.2.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/buildtools</summary>\n\n### [`v3.5.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases/3.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/compare/3.4.0...3.5.0)\n\n-   New warning `provider-params`\n    -   Various fixes and improvements\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;220-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare210220-2020-09-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.1.0...2.2.0)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** don't set --preserve-symlinks-main by default ([#&#8203;2176](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2176)) ([df18c61](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/df18c61))\n-   **builtin:** fix bazel coverage masking test failures ([3d0d1f7](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/3d0d1f7))\n-   **rollup:** allow config files to override default onwarn method ([0b80f6a](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/0b80f6a)), closes [#&#8203;2084](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2084)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add link_workspace_root to nodejs_binary, npm_package_bin, rollup_bundle, terser_minified, ts_project ([4dcb37f](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/4dcb37f))\n-   link_workspace_root not needed in terser_minified ([c80b816](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/c80b816))\n-   promote js_library to public API ([1e357fd](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/1e357fd)), closes [#&#8203;149](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/149) [#&#8203;1771](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1771)\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;210-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare203210-2020-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.0.3...2.1.0)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   use golden_file_test instead ([1ef6704](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/1ef6704))\n-   **typescript:** add the tsBuildInfoFile option to ts_project ([#&#8203;2138](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2138)) ([16def64](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/16def64)), closes [#&#8203;2137](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2137)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **builtin:** accept any stamp vars in pkg_npm ([01bfe4d](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/01bfe4d)), closes [#&#8203;1694](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1694)\n-   **builtin:** support for substitutions ([8a3f9b0](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/8a3f9b0))\n-   **typescript:** generate tsconfig.json for ts_project ([#&#8203;2130](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2130)) ([09ec233](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/09ec233)), closes [#&#8203;2058](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2058)\n\n#### [2.0.3](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.0.2...2.0.3) (2020-08-18)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **examples:** use ./ prefix on babel config file ([374f56f](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/374f56f))\n-   **typescript:** only expect .js outs for .tsx?

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/11.0.0-next.2...11.0.0-next.3)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **common:** add `params` and `reportProgress` options to `HttpClient.put()` overload

([123bff7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/123bff7))\n-   **core:** ensure TestBed is not instantiated before override provider ([#&#8203;38717](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38717)) ([c8f056b](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c8f056b))\n-   **forms:** type NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR injection token as array

[#&#8203;29351](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/29351)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **common:** Add ISO week-numbering year formats support to formatDate ([#&#8203;38828](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38828)) ([984ed39](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/984ed39))\n-   **compiler:** Parse and recover on incomplete opening HTML

[#&#8203;38194](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38194)\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **core:** If you call `TestBed.overrideProvider` after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This\n    behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as `TestBed.overrideDirective`, etc) but they\n    throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the `TestBed.overrideProvider` function.\n    Now calling `TestBed.overrideProvider` after TestBed initialization also triggers an\n    error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where `TestBed.overrideProvider` is\n    called after TestBed initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move `TestBed.overrideProvider` calls\n    before TestBed initialization is completed.\n\n#### 10.1.3 (2020-09-23)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **http&#x3A;** Fix error message when we call jsonp without importing HttpClientJsonpModule ([#&#8203;38756](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38756)) ([3902ec0](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3902ec0))\n-   **ngcc:** fix compilation of `ChangeDetectorRef` in pipe constructors ([#&#8203;38892](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38892)) ([093c3a1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/093c3a1)), closes [#&#8203;38666](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38666) [#&#8203;38883](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38883)\n\n##### Reverts\n\n-   feat(router): better warning message when a router outlet has not been instantiated ([#&#8203;38920](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38920)) ([04d0aa6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/04d0aa6))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

like\r\n\r\nI think it would be preferable to either ship with a tool that is actively maintained or to ship without a default tool at all and just provide documentation on how to configure the tool

new plugin API, `node_modules` size reduction, better source map support, and CSS parser improvements.\n\nCheck out [a day-by-day diary](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936) of PostCSS 8.0 development process.\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n-   `postcss-cli` need to be updated PostCSS to run new plugins\n-   `gulp-postcss` need to be updated PostCSS to run new plugins\n-   `postcss-load-plugins` (used by some environments) can‚Äôt load new plugins\n\n#### Thanks to Sponsors\n\nWith more than [100 M downloads per month](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=postcss), it becomes hard to support PostCSS in free time. For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This would also slow the initial load time of the app (slightly).\r\n\r\nA better solution, I feel, would be to recommend checking against the document if the script already exists, and only adding it if it doesn't exist yet. ie:\r\n```\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (document && document.body && document.body.querySelector && !document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better still, would be to encourage use of Angular/Common's Document Injection, rather than accessing the document directly. ie:\r\n```\r\n// example-module.ts\r\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {YouTubePlayerModule} from '@angular/youtube-player';\r\nimport { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    YouTubePlayerModule,\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [YoutubePlayerExample],\r\n})\r\nexport class YoutubePlayerExampleModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// example-component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: '<youtube-player videoId=\"PRQCAL_RMVo\"></youtube-player>',\r\n  selector: 'youtube-player-example',\r\n})\r\nclass YoutubePlayerExample implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    @Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document,\r\n  ) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (this.document && this.document.body && this.document.body.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = this.document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      this.document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could go on to encourage use of the ? existence check to simplify the if statement to \r\n```\r\nif (this.document?.body?.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]')\r\n```\r\nbut I felt that it was best to recommend a TypeScript version agnostic change (while still encouraging defensive checking).\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts/criticism/input is obviously more than welcome. I'm happy to make a PR for this if the proposed fix is viewed favourably/requested.

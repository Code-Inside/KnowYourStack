It will be useful in the future when verifying that that initializer APIs aren't used in unexpected places.\r\n\r\nI've also introduced tests specifically for the `tryParseInitializerApiMember` function so that we can test it in isolation instead of going through the various functions that call into it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54609","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler-cli): identify aliased initializer functions\" (#54609)"},{"Id":"2155451129","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-27T01:09:15","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"54614","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): untrack various core operations","State":"open","Body":"One downside of implicit dependency tracking in `effect()`s is that it's easy to for downstream code to end up running inside the effect context by accident. For example, if an effect raises an event (e.g. by `next()`ing a `Subject`), the subscribers to that `Observable` will run inside the effect's reactive context, and any signals read within the subscriber will end up as dependencies of the effect. This is why the `untracked` function is useful, to run certain operations without incidental signal reads ending up tracked.\r\n\r\nHowever, knowing when this is necessary is non-trivial. For example, injecting a dependency might cause it to be instantiated, which would run the constructor in the effect context unless the injection operation is untracked.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Angular will automatically drop the reactive context within a number of framework APIs. This commit addresses these use cases:\r\n\r\n* creating and destroying views\r\n* creating and destroying DI injectors\r\n* injecting dependencies\r\n* emitting outputs\r\n\r\nThere are likely other APIs which would benefit from this approach, but this is a start.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54614","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): untrack various core operations\" (#54614)"},{"Id":"2155375840","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-26T23:50:59","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54613","RawContent":null,"Title":"Flickering when changing API tabs ","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nWhen changing from description to Usage notes there is a slight flickering due do a layout shift \r\n\r\nHere is a screenshort exported from a performance audit (sorry for the low res).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/1300985/66d1040a-f283-47ad-805c-5066a44bafe5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/api/core/afterNextRender?tab=usage-notes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54613","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flickering when changing API tabs \" (#54613)"},{"Id":"2155343199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-26T23:19:47","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54612","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): remove Common imports","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54612","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): remove Common imports\" (#54612)"},{"Id":"2154831500","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-26T18:25:30","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54611","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: use angular/team Github team for minimum review set","State":"open","Body":"Use the angular/team Github team to define the list of eligible minimum reviewer set so that it can be reused accross the organization.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: use angular/team Github team for minimum review set\" (#54611)"},{"Id":"2154769008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-26T18:25:10","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54610","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: correct @jeanmeche to @JeanMeche in pullapprove","State":"closed","Body":"Correct the casing so that it works as expected.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54610","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: correct @jeanmeche to @JeanMeche in pullapprove\" (#54610)"},{"Id":"2154641067","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-26T17:04:35","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"54608","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(build): Import angular LS package in g3","State":"closed","Body":"Import `angular/packages/language-service` in g3.

","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHost property on Angular Component decorator doesnt apply more than one class. @HostBinding works fine. \r\n\r\nCode example:\r\n\r\nThis works just fine. Every class is an element of an array. even the calculated one is ok. \r\n\r\n  host: {\r\n    '[class]': `['flex', 'max-w-max', orientation === 'row' && !reversed ? 'flex-row': '',]`,\r\n  },\r\n\r\nHowever this doesn't work. Two classes in a string are not added to element class:\r\n\r\n  host: {\r\n    '[class]': `['bg-primary p-10']`,\r\n  },\r\n\r\nWhen used with @HostBinding works just fine:\r\n\r\n @HostBinding('attr.class')\r\n  get Classes() {\r\n    return ['bg-primary p-10']\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  Same story happens with strings returned by functions:\r\n\r\n host: {    '[class]': `[getOrientationDirection(orientation), getOrientationAlign(orientation), getGap(elementGap)]`,  },\r\n\r\nThis works, as long as each returns ONLY ONE class, for example:\r\n\r\n getOrientationDirection(orientation: AppFlexDirection) {\r\n    if (orientation === 'row') {\r\n      return 'flex-row';\r\n    }\r\n    return '';\r\n  }\r\n\r\nWhen returning 2 classes it doesnt work. So after extensive testing i came into conclusion, that the implementation of host is not working very well with tailwind, however @HostBinding works just fine, however its now a legacy feature, cant be fully replaced by host at this point.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.0.9\r\nNode: 20.10.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.9\r\n@angular/material               17.0.5\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.0.9\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.9\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nwebpack                         5.89.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54605","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bug: Angular Host property not processing tailwind classes properly.

There's not any reason to exclude `Dirty` views from the loop in `detectChangesInternal` because it would just be picked up in the `ApplicationRef` loop anyways.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54594","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): Update dirty views in detectChanges loop\" (#54594)"},{"Id":"2151800672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-23T21:07:41","Actor":"PavelTurk","Number":"54592","RawContent":null,"Title":"A typo in a SVG file","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThere is a typo in file https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/aio/content/images/guide/dependency-injection/injectors.svg \r\n(extra single quote) at 1:143\r\n```\r\n<style>@import url(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css\");'</style>\r\n                                                                                                ^\r\n```\r\n                   \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIt doesn't mean I have nothing to do.

It's repetitive, and more importantly it obscures the real nature of the value. What if I accidentally do the wrong error property in the controller method? easy mistake to make when copy-pasting and hard to notice when the inlined value is not there.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the only reason this is the case is that we want to pass some lambda to the errorstatematcher, but it would *really* be great if these shiny new input signals and stuff would handle this.\r\n\r\nYes, I know I can just make a formgroup and write a reactive form. That's overkill and a ton of extra crust for two fields and a button.\r\n\r\nAS AN ALTERNATIVE, I would accept: presence of a mat-error in the formfield automatically sets errorState to true, and then I can just wrap all these in `@if (error().email) { <mat-error>woops</mat-error> }` sorts of things. Based on the number of yaqs... i mean stack overflow comments I've seen about this, it seems like this is what a lot of developers think the behavior should be anyway. I'll admit that I thought the same thing. It's a little odd, having an API defined by \"what child elements are in your tree\" but you opened that door when you made mat-form-fields bind garbage on the child form input element. Not that I can think of a better approach here, honestly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28632","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-form-field): simplified errorstatematcher\" (#28632)"},{"Id":"2149098708","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T18:16:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28628","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): requireSelection sometimes not clearing value when editing after selection","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that if the user has `requireSelection` enabled, selects a value and then deletes a character while the input still has a value, the selection wasn't being cleared as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes #28432.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28628","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): requireSelection sometimes not clearing value when editing after selection\" (#28628)"},{"Id":"2149418063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T16:12:54","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28631","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.3.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28631","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.3.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#28631)"},{"Id":"2149376268","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T15:58:37","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28630","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.2.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28630","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.2.1 release\" (#28630)"},{"Id":"2149343041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T15:48:49","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28629","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.2.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28629","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.2.1\" with changelog.\" (#28629)"},{"Id":"2148790409","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T13:34:35","Actor":"kklocker","Number":"28626","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CDK_TABLE): \"NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken CDK_TABLE!\" after upgrade of cdk to 17.1.0","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n@angular/cdk: 17.0.4\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, we have a pretty large codebase with a custom table class `TableComponent` that extends CdkTable<T>.\r\nI am now trying to bump our angular stack but this fails at runtime.\r\nThese are some of the package changes.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/25065744/9e49e296-b0de-43d9-98b1-e24fe4adad95)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a sneaking suspicion that this \"bug\" was introduced with #28356\r\nLooking for help as to how to resolve this\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI don't really know if this is a bug or if our implementation has been wrong, but this worked in the last version\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hj5acn?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

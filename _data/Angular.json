Often, developers map observables to fields within a mapping and then name that mapping. This leads to blocks that look like the following:\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"{ \r\n    a: aObservable$ | async,\r\n    b: bObservable$ | async,\r\n    c: cObservable$ | async\r\n} as obs\">\r\n  <p>{{ obs.a }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.b }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.c }}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nThere is an annoying bug with this code though. When one of the observables within the mapping returns a value, the result is defined, therefore the entire NgIf results to `true` (since an object is truthy). This causes race conditions and cases where the nested html is rendered with null fields instead of the expected emitted values.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to fix this issue is to break it into multiple async calls:\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"aObservable$ | async as a\">\r\n  <div *ngIf=\"bObservable$ | async as b\">\r\n    <div *ngIf=\"cObservable$ | async as c\">\r\n      <p>{{ a }}</p>\r\n      <p>{{ b }}</p>\r\n      <p>{{ c }}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nThis leads to deep nesting though and is cumbersome to write and consume.\r\n\r\nWithin our codebase I have implemented the proposed solution and was wondering if others were open to me contributing it to @angular/common pipes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI implemented the `multiasync` pipe. It works just like the `async` pipe but operates on a mapping to observables instead of a singular observable value.\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"{ \r\n    a: aObservable$,\r\n    b: bObservable$,\r\n    c: cObservable$\r\n} | multiasync as obs\">\r\n  <p>{{ obs.a }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.b }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.c }}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally, `multiasync`is similar to async but instead of a singular subscription it is subscribing to all the member observables using `combineLatest`. This results in a value once all the observables emit. It will also re-render the inner html when any of observables update after that initial emit.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI tried to implement this with multiple async pipes but nothing worked as intended or was ugly to write and hard to use. I think the above pattern is fairly common (I could be wrong), and if so, this might be a nice ergonomic addition to angular's pipes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55693","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Async Pipe for map of Observables\" (#55693)"},{"Id":"2281859989","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-06T22:02:13","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"55695","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Remove custom event and replay behavior.","State":"open","Body":"These behaviors have been moved back to g3.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, it contains a very complex new feature and while all of esbuild's tests pass, I would not be surprised if an important edge case turns out to be broken. So I'm releasing this as a breaking change release to avoid causing any trouble. As usual, make sure to test your code when you upgrade.\n\n-   Implement the JavaScript decorators proposal ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now contains an implementation of the upcoming [JavaScript decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). This is the same feature that shipped in [TypeScript 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) and has been highly-requested on esbuild's issue tracker. You can read more about them in that blog post and in this other (now slightly outdated) extensive blog post here: https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html. Here's a quick example:\n\n    ```js\n    const log = (fn, context) => function() {\n      console.log(`before ${context.name}`)\n      const it = fn.apply(this, arguments)\n      console.log(`after ${context.name}`)\n      return it\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;log static foo() {\n        console.log('in foo')\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Logs \"before foo\", \"in foo\", \"after foo\"\n    Foo.foo()\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature is different than the existing \"TypeScript experimental decorators\" feature that esbuild already implements. It uses similar syntax but behaves very differently, and the two are not compatible (although it's sometimes possible to write decorators that work with both). TypeScript experimental decorators will still be supported by esbuild going forward as they have been around for a long time, are very widely used, and let you do certain things that are not possible with JavaScript decorators (such as decorating function parameters). By default esbuild will parse and transform JavaScript decorators, but you can tell esbuild to parse and transform TypeScript experimental decorators instead by setting `\"experimentalDecorators\": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n    Probably at least half of the work for this feature went into creating a test suite that exercises many of the proposal's edge cases: https://github.com/evanw/decorator-tests. It has given me a reasonable level of confidence that esbuild's initial implementation is acceptable. However, I don't have access to a significant sample of real code that uses JavaScript decorators. If you're currently using JavaScript decorators in a real code base, please try out esbuild's implementation and let me know if anything seems off.\n\n    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**\n\n    This proposal has been in the works for a very long time (work began around 10 years ago in 2014) and it is finally getting close to becoming part of the JavaScript language. However, it's still a work in progress and isn't a part of JavaScript yet, so keep in mind that any code that uses JavaScript decorators may need to be updated as the feature continues to evolve. The decorators proposal is pretty close to its final form but it can and likely will undergo some small behavioral adjustments before it ends up becoming a part of the standard. If/when that happens, I will update esbuild's implementation to match the specification. I will not be supporting old versions of the specification.\n\n-   Optimize the generated code for private methods\n\n    Previously when lowering private methods for old browsers, esbuild would generate one `WeakSet` for each private method. This mirrors similar logic for generating one `WeakSet` for each private field. Using a separate `WeakMap` for private fields is necessary as their assignment can be observable:\n\n    ```js\n    let it\n    class Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        it = this\n      }\n    }\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #x = 1\n      #y = null.foo\n      static check() {\n        console.log(#x in it, #y in it)\n      }\n    }\n    try { new Foo } catch {}\n    Foo.check()\n    ```\n\n    This prints `true false` because this partially-initialized instance has `#x` but not `#y`. In other words, it's not true that all class instances will always have all of their private fields. However, the assignment of private methods to a class instance is not observable. In other words, it's true that all class instances will always have all of their private methods. This means esbuild can lower private methods into code where all methods share a single `WeakSet`, which is smaller, faster, and uses less memory. Other JavaScript processing tools such as the TypeScript compiler already make this optimization. Here's what this change looks like:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      #x() { return this.#x() }\n      #y() { return this.#y() }\n      #z() { return this.#z() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _x, x_fn, _y, y_fn, _z, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _x);\n        __privateAdd(this, _y);\n        __privateAdd(this, _z);\n      }\n    }\n    _x = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _x, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _y = new WeakSet();\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _y, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _z = new WeakSet();\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _z, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n\n    // New output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _Foo_instances, x_fn, y_fn, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _Foo_instances);\n      }\n    }\n    _Foo_instances = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    ```\n\n-   Fix an obscure bug with lowering class members with computed property keys\n\n    When class members that use newer syntax features are transformed for older target environments, they sometimes need to be relocated. However, care must be taken to not reorder any side effects caused by computed property keys. For example, the following code must evaluate `a()` then `b()` then `c()`:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild did this by shifting the computed property key *forward* to the next spot in the evaluation order. Classes evaluate all computed keys first and then all static class elements, so if the last computed key needs to be shifted, esbuild previously inserted a static block at start of the class body, ensuring it came before all other static class elements:\n\n    ```js\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, this could cause esbuild to accidentally generate a syntax error if the computed property key contains code that isn't allowed in a static block, such as an `await` expression. With this release, esbuild fixes this problem by shifting the computed property key *backward* to the previous spot in the evaluation order instead, which may push it into the `extends` clause or even before the class itself:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [await b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = await b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a, _b;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      [(_b = a(), _a = await b(), _b)]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix some `--keep-names` edge cases\n\n    The [`NamedEvaluation` syntax-directed operation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-namedevaluation) in the JavaScript specification gives certain anonymous expressions a `name` property depending on where they are in the syntax tree. For example, the following initializers convey a `name` value:\n\n    ```js\n    var foo = function() {}\n    var bar = class {}\n    console.log(foo.name, bar.name)\n    ```\n\n    When you enable esbuild's `--keep-names` setting, esbuild generates additional code to represent this `NamedEvaluation` operation so that the value of the `name` property persists even when the identifiers are renamed (e.g. due to minification).\n\n    However, I recently learned that esbuild's implementation of `NamedEvaluation` is missing a few cases. Specifically esbuild was missing property definitions, class initializers, logical-assignment operators. These cases should now all be handled:\n\n    ```js\n    var obj = { foo: function() {} }\n    class Foo0 { foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo1 { static foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo2 { accessor foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo3 { static accessor foo = function() {} }\n    foo ||= function() {}\n    foo &&= function() {}\n    foo ??= function() {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote (pacote)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.5`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1805-2024-05-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v18.0.4...v18.0.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`5e75582`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/5e755820b70f60ea136d9e85eb42a6c2d9718472) [#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/368) dont set \\_contentLength if not in headers ([#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/368)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) move bin to its own directory ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) refactor: symbol cleanup ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/365)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.77.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1770)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.76.0...1.77.0)\n\n-   *Don't* throw errors for at-rules in keyframe blocks.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I accidentally ran into some of these limits. I had to grab a calculator, the build output, make some assumptions, run some calculations, before I could actually understand what these options meant.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these were unambiguous.\r\n\r\nThe generated project limits rules-as-written are:\r\n\r\n- Initial maximum warning: 500 kilobits\r\n- Initial maximum error: 1millibit\r\n- Any component style maximum warning: 2 kilobits\r\n- Any component style maximum error: 6 kilobits\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's assume that the the `m` in `mb` should be `M`, that's a factor 10⁹ difference, but ¹/₁₀₀₀ bits makes no sense here, since we're talking about real storage here. I've only ever used millibits in calculations on pure information.\r\n\r\nI analysed this output:\r\n\r\n> Budget 500.00 kB was not met by 589.00 kB with a total of 1.06 MB\r\n\r\nThis quickly points in the direction that the `b` should be a `B`, it's bytes, not bits.\r\nFinally if I run some calculations on this, it clears up another thing (but the output is faulty here too).\r\n\r\n(500 + 589)×10³ ≠ 1.06 × 10⁶ (rules-as-written ISO prefixes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ ≠ 1.06 × 10³ × 2¹⁰ (floppy disk megabytes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ = 1.06 × 10²⁰ (actually intended ISO/IEC 80000-13 binary prefix standard)\r\n\r\nFrom this I can conclude that the numbers used in calculations are actually using the binary measures according to ISO/IEC 80000 (which is the most common for modern systems AFAIK), and the `k` should be `ki` and the `m` should ultimately be `Mi`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it's no trivial matter to understand what the configuration file actually means with these values:\r\n\r\n- Initial maximum warning: 500 kiB (kibibytes) or 500 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 512000 bytes\r\n- Initial maximum error: 1 MiB (mebibyte) or 1 × 10²⁰ bytes = 1048576 bytes\r\n- Any component style maximum warning: 2 kiB or 2 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 2048 bytes\r\n- Any component style maximum error: 6 kiB or 6 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 6144 bytes\r\n\r\nNote that you now suddenly can see that the initial maximum _warning_ is **not** half of the initial maximum _error_ but is approximately 48.8% of the maximum error.\r\n\r\nWhile not a big priority, as it is unlikely to cause problems whose solution isn't obvious (increase the limits), it is annoying as it can unexpectedly cause errors whose exact cause is hard to understand.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`ng g new app`\r\nCheck `angular.json` » project » app » architect » build » configuration » production » budgets\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.6\r\nNode: 22.0.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1703.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n    \r\nWarning: The current version of Node (22.0.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27580","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Confusing project budgets\" (#27580)"},{"Id":"2280924031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-06T14:03:25","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27602","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): format sizes using decimal byte units consistently","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure that file sizes are consistently formatted using decimal byte units, adhering to the International System of Units (SI) convention.

The new CLI `@tailwindcss/cli` traverses files in your project and automatically finds the tailwind classes. It works without a tailwind config, which is what the angular builder looks for to support tailwind. The problem is, you have to setup an npm script to invoke the tailwind CLI, and it is seemingly impossible to integrate it into Angular's build process. I've tried lots of weird hacky things.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Tailwind v4 offers a new [postcss plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#using-post-css), but again, there is no way to configure post css in Angular.\r\n\r\nOther issues with using Tailwind v4 in an Angular project:\r\n- `@angular-devkit/build-angular` (v16 and v17) has a peer dependency of `\"tailwindcss\": \"^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0\",`\r\n- Tailwind support is currently [baked into the builder](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L78), making it impossible to support new major versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to be able to use the latest and greatest in our Angular projects. As a start we should remove the peer dependency on old versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to decouple tailwind integration out of this package so it can be configurable by devs.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI have an angular 16 project [here](https://github.com/jamie-perkins-sp/angular16-test/tree/tailwind-v4) with tailwind v4 installed, you have to use the `--force` flag to install dependencies because of the incompatible tailwind peer dep. An npm script \"tailwind\"  has to be run separately from the build, so for every style change you have to rerun the command.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nv16 and v17\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting Tailwind v4\" (#27585)"},{"Id":"2276093089","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:28:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27583","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27583","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#27583)"},{"Id":"2276078974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:23:28","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27582","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#27582)"},{"Id":"2275772137","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T16:21:58","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27581","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): only generate shallow preload links for initial files","State":"closed","Body":"To remove the potential for a large amount of modulepreload link elements being added to the generating `index.html` for an application, the number of elements is now limited to five.

This issue occurs despite the component being properly bound to the updated options. This behavior limits dynamic interaction capabilities, such as updating marker styles in real-time based on user interactions or data changes.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would allow developers to dynamically change the properties of markers on a map based on real-time data or user interactions. For example, changing the color or icon of a marker to reflect it's status (e.g., available, busy, or inactive) without needing to remove and re-add the marker to the map. This can be particularly useful in applications like live tracking systems, where the state of an object can change frequently.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(google-maps): Dynamic update support for advanced marker options\" (#29004)"},{"Id":"2278570918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-04T16:55:19","Actor":"NickUfer","Number":"28999","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/dialog): support open and close animations for overlay and backdrop","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28999","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/dialog): support open and close animations for overlay and backdrop\" (#28999)"},{"Id":"2278004955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T16:31:10","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"28997","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): Change themeTypes to a single select instead of a multiselect prompt in M3 theme schematic","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28997","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/schematics): Change themeTypes to a single select instead of a multiselect prompt in M3 theme schematic\" (#28997)"},{"Id":"2277058079","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T13:04:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28996","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button): incorrect template for icon button anchor","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the icon button anchor was using the base button template instead of the icon button one.\r\n\r\nFixes #28990.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/button): incorrect template for icon button anchor\" (#28996)"},{"Id":"2274983797","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T13:04:08","Actor":"pedroestabruxelles","Number":"28990","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-icon-button): anchor is pointing to the incorrect template","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAnchor icon button is pointing to the button.html template, this causes style inconsistency for example when using the icon button with text, e.g.: <button mat-icon-button>A</button>\r\n\r\nButton:\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `button[mat-icon-button]`,\r\n  templateUrl: 'icon-button.html',\r\n  (...)\r\n})\r\n\r\nAnchor:\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `a[mat-icon-button]`,\r\n  templateUrl: 'button.html',\r\n  (...)\r\n})\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis is not needed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth anchor/button mat-icon-button should be using the same template\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nanchor/button mat-icon-button are not using the same template\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28990","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-icon-button): anchor is pointing to the incorrect template\" (#28990)"},{"Id":"2272578629","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T06:58:52","Actor":"jacob-amptech","Number":"28983","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(MapMarkerAdvanced, MapOptions, MapTypeStyle): MapMarkerAdvanced requires mapId, but MapTypeStyle[] cannot be used with a mapId","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWhen attempting to implement a dark theme using a MapTypeStyle[] in MapOptions the styles do not apply and the following message is printed to the console:\r\n\r\n> A Map's styles property cannot be set when a mapId is present.

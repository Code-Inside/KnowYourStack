projection and content projection of content projection (reprojection) I stumble upon a question that I think is an issue when using `contentChild`\r\n\r\nI created two components in which I project content using `ng-content` and associated directives to access them\r\n\r\n## Reprojection component\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'reprojection-component',\r\n  imports: [ReprojectionDirective, JsonPipe],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h2>Reprojection Component</h2>\r\n    <p>{{ reprojectionContentChild() | json }}<p>\r\n    <p><ng-content select=\"reprojection\" /></p>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class ReprojectionComponent {\r\n  public readonly reprojectionContentChild = contentChild(\r\n    ReprojectionDirective\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Projection component\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: `projection-component`,\r\n  imports: [ProjectionDirective, ReprojectionDirective, ReprojectionComponent, JsonPipe],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h2>Projection Component</h2>\r\n    <p>{{ projectionContentChild() | json }}<p>\r\n    <p>{{ reprojectionContentChild() | json }}<p>\r\n\r\n    <ng-content select=\"projection\"

{\r\n  projectionContentChild = contentChild(ProjectionDirective);\r\n  reprojectionContentChild = contentChild(ReprojectionDirective);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Directives projection and reprojection\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: `projection`,\r\n})\r\nexport class ProjectionDirective {\r\n  public readonly title = 'projection-directive';\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: `reprojection`,\r\n})\r\nexport class ReprojectionDirective {\r\n  public readonly title = 'reprojection-directive';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Main component\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [Projection, ProjectionDirective, ReprojectionDirective],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <projection-component>\r\n      <projection>Projection</projection>\r\n      <reprojection>ReprojectionComponent</reprojection>\r\n    </projection-component>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ts\r\nMy issue is that it seems that `contentChild` either for projected or reprojected content seems to be enable only in `ProjectionComponent`. But from my understanding \r\n\r\n- `<projection>...</projection>`, `contentChild` should work in `ProjectionComponent` for this\r\n- `<reprojection>...</reprojection>`, `contentChild` should work in `ReprojectionComponent` for this\r\n\r\nHowever as you can see on screen below, only `ProjectionComponent` has access to both projected content using `contentChild`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b0dbaee-0c50-47a8-8b79-2acb9cbc87c5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-47lfxu?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular cli: ^18.0.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57373","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue with contentChild of reprojected content\" (#57373)"},{"Id":"2464290428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T21:52:51","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57379","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Add support for function/method overloads","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #57255 to `18.2.x`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57379","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): Add support for function/method overloads\" (#57379)"},{"Id":"2464240451","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T21:20:31","Actor":"rafaelblink","Number":"57378","RawContent":null,"Title":"The links styles on the roadmap page are not being rendered correctly.","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nLooks like links with dots are not being rendered correctly from markdown.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"855\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1260b515-19fd-4402-b1a8-ee3fcabcd335\">\r\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/roadmap\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57378","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The links styles on the roadmap page are not being rendered correctly.\" (#57378)"},{"Id":"2461922464","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:10:38","Actor":"iteriani","Number":"57355","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Add experimental support to have one event contract w…","State":"closed","Body":"…hen there are multiple apps on the page.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It allows us to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables, which can really tidy up the code. Right now, Angular templates don’t natively support this within @for() loops or async if's, which feels like a missed opportunity.\r\n\r\nImagine being able to write something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<div @for({id, name} of items)>\r\n  {{id}}: {{name}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div @if(data$ | async; as {a, b})\">\r\n  {{a}} - {{b}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would allow developers to directly destructure objects or arrays right in the template, making the templates cleaner and more intuitive.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd support for destructuring within @for() loops and async if's in Angular templates. The syntax could be very similar to how destructuring works in TypeScript, allowing for a seamless experience between the two.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div @for({property1, property2} of dataList)>\r\n  {{property1}} - {{property2}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div @if(observable$ | async; as {prop1, prop2})\">\r\n  {{prop1}} and {{prop2}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis approach would make the template code more concise and closer to the TypeScript code, improving both readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCustom Pipes or Directives: Another alternative is to create custom pipes or directives that handle destructuring. But this can lead to over-engineering and makes the codebase harder to understand, especially for teams that may not be familiar with these custom solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request💥 Add Destructuring Support in @for Loops and async if's \" (#57374)"},{"Id":"2462982480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T16:54:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"57367","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inject migration follow-up fixes","State":"closed","Body":"Includes the following fixes that came up after internal testing of the `inject` migration.\r\n\r\n### fix(migrations): preserve optional parameters\r\nMakes it so the inject migration preserves the optional token when declaring a parameter.

Given that the default is implements OnInit, this leads to unnecessary post-editing (removing OnInit, or adding other hooks by hand). As you gain experience in angular, you are able to tell beforehand which hooks you're gonna need before you issue ng g c, but the CLI doesn't give you a way to fine-tune the generated code at the command level.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIf you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nIntroduce --hooks flag, taking a piped string of hooks to implement, or a specific constant to include none. Examples:\r\n\r\nng g c mycomp --hooks none = ng g c mycomp -h\r\nng g c mycomp --hooks OnInit|OnDestroy|AfterViewInit\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nprovides a \"compositional\" granular opt-in model (as opposed to --skip* model which presumes existing defaults)\r\nscalable (same syntax could also apply to directives, services, eg. ng g s myserv --hooks OnDestroy)\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nnot a fast-track solution\r\nHaving a flag to control the implements part would allow user to create custom scripts to follow the smart/dumb paradigm in their workflow, such as:\r\n\r\nng g c --hooks OnInit|OnDestroy|AfterViewInit -s false\r\n   // usage: npm run csmart -- mycomp (= create mycomp, specified hooks, styles in ext file)\r\n\r\nng g c --hooks -c OnPush -s true\r\n   // usage: npm run cdumb -- mycomp  (= create mycomp, no hooks, CD OnPush, inline style)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHave you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nI would gladly hear of one if exists.\r\n\r\nOf course, the suggested flag --hooks (alias -h) is just an example - you might choose a different wording, such as --implements, however implements could suggest that user's custom or 3rd party interfaces/classes could be implemented too, while the option we discuss pertains to Angular lifecycle hooks only\r\n\r\nA fast-track solution would be to provide --skipOnInit flag, but this is a non-scalable solution which I don't want to promote here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28192","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"generate component: Add an option to fine-tune the inclusion of lifecycle hooks\" (#28192)"},{"Id":"2459619219","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-12T13:42:18","Actor":"adamwoxsoft","Number":"28189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematic input does not validate against the Schema ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI'm trying to create a guard with `ng g guard shared/utils/auth`.

While the affected documentation page shows that it is a component that is compatible with m3 styles, implementing this into a class:\r\n`@include mat.chips-color($theme, $color-variant: $color);`\r\napplying the class to a mat-chip does not affect the color variant.\r\n\r\nI have labeled this as a docs bug because m3 styling options are not referenced at all in the mat-chips documentation here: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview and there are no examples of styling chips in the docs. If styling chips is an intended feature, this issue should be moved into m3 bug as the scss is not producing correct styling when including the mat.chips-color mixin.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAfter a couple of hours of testing, I have identified that color variance only affects 'mat-chip-option' components when they are selected. This should be included in component overview documentation and potentially have an example with various styling as to show that color variance will not affect the standard mat-chip.\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29576","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Chips\" (#29576)"},{"Id":"2463308046","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T13:03:59","Actor":"SuphalAthlur","Number":"29575","RawContent":null,"Title":"Should the datepicker's close button be using .cdk-visually-hidden?","State":"open","Body":"              can this just be .cdk-visually-hidden instead?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mmalerba in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20666#discussion_r497775913_\r\n            \r\n\r\nIdeally, anything that is not visible on the screen should not be announced to screen readers.

However even when you are using the default 'primary' styling of a select (as documented https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants) the background highlighting of the selected option in the select uses the secondary palette.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10 23 41 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435d9bfb-1856-41f3-a5a6-7839c92d1439)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis is a stackblitz forked from the `mat-select` documentation. It has been adjusted to use custom styles as produced by the output of `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` with the following colors: primary: `ff0000`, secondary: `00ff00`, tertiary: `0000ff`. The generated m3-theme.scss was copied over into that stack blitz and `m3-theme.$light-theme` was then used for `@include mat.all-component-themes(m3-theme.$light-theme)` in `styles.scss`\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/nngoxu-ggvcsg?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click to select element to open up the options list; note the background of the selected element is miscolored\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the selected background color of a given palette to either be static (as in M2's `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)`) or to be based on the colors in the palette chosen to style that component.\r\n\r\nPossible work arounds:\r\n* Use material provided palettes (ie mat.$red-palette). \r\n* Use a secondary color / palette that is produced as a variant the primary color / palette.\r\n* Set the css variable `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color`. \r\n\r\nFor my code I went with option 3; `--mat-option-selected-state-layer-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);`. Note for option 3, as this is styling something in a `cdk-overlay-container` you have to make sure that your override still applies. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe background color of a 'primary' (default) styled select appears to be using the color as specified in the secondary palette at the '90' level. This 'works' when you use the included scss material palettes because the 'secondary' palette is bundled as a subelement of that palette. A trimmed version of the 'rose' palette (rose/red is one of the styling options on the angular material page), as found in @angular/material/core/themeing/_palettes.scss looks like \r\n\r\n```\r\n/// Rose color palette to be used as primary or tertiary palette.\r\n$rose-palette: _apply-patches((\r\n  0: #000000,\r\n  10: #3f001b,\r\n  <... color levels ...>\r\n  secondary: (\r\n    <... color levels ...>\r\n    90: #ffd9e1, // this is what the selected element actually uses on material.angular.io when using the 'Rose and Red' theme\r\n    <... more color levels>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral: (\r\n    <... color levels...>\r\n  ),\r\n  neutral-variant: (\r\n     <... color levels ...>\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n```\r\nSo even for the documentation stylings all of the secondary palettes are mutated forms of the primary palettes and so the selected element's background looks good. When using the `ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme` no such binding between the primary palette & secondary palette is implied or generated. So when it selects a secondary.90 for styling the background of a primary styled mat-select component it looks wrong.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/select): Material 3 mat-selects use the secondary color for selected item backgrounds (when the component is styled to primary)\" (#29553)"},{"Id":"2453019216","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T16:34:56","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29548","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/sidenav): disable focus trap while closed","State":"closed","Body":"Completely disables the sidenav's focus trap while it's closed so users can't tab to the anchors.\r\n\r\nFixes #29545.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29548","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/sidenav): disable focus trap while closed\" (#29548)"},{"Id":"2453742289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T15:14:28","Actor":"berga0d","Number":"29551","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix sidenav container-background color according to M3","State":"open","Body":"According to https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/specs it should use \"Surface container low\".\r\nOtherwise, when used in fixed opened, there won't be any separation from the content.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55b72da-d2a1-4ebf-a6f5-2973a8e84773)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29551","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix sidenav container-background color according to M3\" (#29551)"},{"Id":"2453490867","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-07T13:28:55","Actor":"jonathont","Number":"29549","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(datepicker): Support fixed height with displaying trailing and leading days of surrounding months","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the Angular Material implementation of the Material date picker only seems to display the current month's days, without the trailing days of the previous month and leading days of the next month (if any).\r\nAn example of the current UI:\r\n![angularmaterialdatepicker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77815f09-45fb-44ee-963f-9eb0dee5ec50)\r\n\r\nHowever when switching between months, the height of the component changes depending on the alignment of the weeks within the currently viewed month.\r\n\r\n![angmatdate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c68d5ac4-faea-4224-ac5a-c14ce156cb44)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is for the Angular Material date picker to support displaying the trailing/leading days and maintain a fixed height, which particularly when inline, is much easier to design for when developing a surrounding layout compared to a component that has variable/jumping height.\r\n\r\nThe Date picker in the Material 3 spec does seem to support this as shown:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb71e4f6-ea3f-4f60-8b27-7999bb0cc3f9)\r\n(From https://m3.material.io/components/date-pickers/specs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29549","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(datepicker): Support fixed height with displaying trailing and leading days of surrounding months\" (#29549)"},{"Id":"2451777105","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-06T22:19:22","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"29547","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(button-toggle): Mixin does not support color variants","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAccording to [documentation](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants), the MatButtonToggle component can be stylized using 4 color variants: \r\n\r\n> | Component | Supported $color-variant values | Default |\r\n> |--------|--------|--------|\r\n> | Button-toggle | primary, secondary, tertiary, error | secondary |\r\n\r\nBut when I use the mixin `@include mat.button-toggle-color(theme.$light-theme, $color-variant: primary);` I get the following error:\r\n```\r\n\"Invalid color variant: primary.

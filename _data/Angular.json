In some (most?) distributed systems applications, the initializing request includes authorization information, e.g., one-time service token, which enable a single-sign-on (SSO) experience across the integrated distributed applications. Unfortunately, the initializing request is not available to Angular applications which forces a sign-in for protected resources/routes. If the initializing request was available to Angular applications, then the initializing request's authorization information could be used to create a SSO experience.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine in a dedicated IAS application which authenticates the user and generates service authorization tokens:\r\n\r\n    example.org/identity/authenticate\r\n\r\nand a protected CRM application implemented in Angular with a deep-link to a customer:\r\n\r\n    example.org/customers/1234/invoices/2345\r\n\r\nSince `/customers/` is a protected resource, the Angular authentication guard redirects to `/identity/authenticate` unless the CRM application has access to the IAS generated service token. For a deep-link like `/customers/1234/invoices/2345` the initial request to the Angular application will start the application but the Angular application won't have access to the initializing request which means it will redirect to `/identiy/authenticate`.\r\n\r\nURL parameters are available to the Angular application in the authentication guard, so it's possible to include a one-time service token in a parameter but this is not a nice user experience with the token in the browser's address history and is only reasonable/secure for one-time service tokens.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCapture the initializing request and provide an API for it.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nURL parameters are available to the Angular application in the authentication guard, so it's possible to include a one-time service token in a parameter but this is not a nice user experience with the token in the browser's address history and is only reasonable/secure for one-time service tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57001","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Capture HTTP request which starts the application\" (#57001)"},{"Id":"2410951822","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-16T11:55:32","Actor":"blazekv","Number":"56999","RawContent":null,"Title":"Form events with async validators doesn't emit StatusChangeEvent","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIn special cases emitting status does not still work. It was already reported in #41519 and should be fixed but it is not. \r\n\r\nProblem is that Angular is internally calling **_runAsyncValidator** with own emitEvent flags which could override options like emitEvent which was previously called by using Forms API (pathValue, setValue etc.). Minimal reproduction is in Stackblitz link but there are several important things:\r\n1) There is asyncValidator with some delay\r\n2) There is formGroup and formControlName in template (without formControlName directive it will work)\r\n3) **patchValue is called in @Input setter** - if you call it in ngOnInit it will work - because Angular is calling updateValueAndValidity several times this setup probably leads to scenarion described at the bottom\r\n\r\nActual implementation by @JeanMeche should fix this problem by passing this events into new events stream. If think that implementation is still problematic because the main problem is that something could internally change form status without informing subscribers, but despite this I believe that it still does not work as intended.\r\n\r\nAlso [reichemn](https://github.com/reichemn) point out here https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41519#issuecomment-2127185139 that documentation is not correct. \r\n\r\nIn current implementation there is new internal flag **shouldHaveEmitted** which should have information about if some manual call of API request **emitEvent**, but problem is that is based only on **emitEvent** flag and not also **shouldHaveEmitted** flag. \r\n\r\nTherefore this scenarion will break that behavior:\r\n1) Manual call which will trigger updateValueAndValidity - `form.patchValue({}, {emitEvent: true})`\r\n2) Internal call which will trigger updateValueAndValidity with emitEvent false - this will cancel previous asyncValidatorSubscription and because emitEvent was true it will continue with shouldHaveEmitted set to true\r\n3)  Internal call which will trigger updateValueAndValidity with emitEvent false - this will cancel previous asyncValidatorSubscription and because emitEvent was false it will continue with shouldHaveEmitted set to false\r\n4) Result is that previous information that events should be emitted are completly lost by internal calls of framework\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like this little change (when also shouldHaveEmitted is retrieved from canceled subscriptions) could fix this. I changed only these two lines\r\n```shouldHaveEmitted: shouldHaveEmitted !== false```\r\nand \r\n```const shouldHaveEmitted = (this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator?.emitEvent || this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator?.shouldHaveEmitted) || ?? false;```\r\n\r\n**Code with context**\r\n```\r\n_runAsyncValidator(shouldHaveEmitted, emitEvent) {\r\n    if (this.asyncValidator) {\r\n      this.status = PENDING;\r\n      this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator = {\r\n        emitEvent: emitEvent !== false,\r\n        shouldHaveEmitted: shouldHaveEmitted !== false\r\n      };\r\n      const obs = toObservable(this.asyncValidator(this));\r\n      this._asyncValidationSubscription = obs.subscribe((errors) => {\r\n        this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator = null;\r\n        this.setErrors(errors, {\r\n          emitEvent,\r\n          shouldHaveEmitted\r\n        });\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  _cancelExistingSubscription() {\r\n    if (this._asyncValidationSubscription) {\r\n      this._asyncValidationSubscription.unsubscribe();\r\n      const shouldHaveEmitted = (this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator?.emitEvent || this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator?.shouldHaveEmitted) || ?? false;\r\n      this._hasOwnPendingAsyncValidator = null;\r\n      return shouldHaveEmitted;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-zssofu?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.1.0\r\nNode: 20.12.2\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.2.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56999","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Form events with async validators doesn't emit StatusChangeEvent\" (#56999)"},{"Id":"2410944410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-16T11:51:25","Actor":"sheikalthaf","Number":"56998","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): use signal apis for directive forest","State":"open","Body":"Refactor the directive-forest components to use signal apis, in future we can make the components onPush and zoneless\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In addition, working on the zoneless fixture revealed oddities in the behavior of the zone-based fixture, or behaviors that we felt were counterintuitive. The most consequential difference is how change detection works: `detectChanges` goes through ApplicationRef.tick in zoneless while it is `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges` in the zone fixture.\r\n\r\nWe felt that running change detection through `ApplicationRef.tick` was important for several reasons:\r\n* Aligning application behavior more closely with the test behavior (almost all views are attached to application ref in reality)\r\n* Ensuring that afterRender* hooks are executed when calling `fixture.detectChanges`\r\n* Ensuring that the change detection runs again if render hooks update state\r\n\r\nThis change, however, has some noticeable consequences that will break some tests, mostly around how errors are handled. `ApplicationRef.tick` catches errors that happen during change detection and reports them to the ErrorHandler from DI. The default error handler only logs the error to the console. This will break tests which have `expect(() => fixture.detectChanges()).toThrow()`. In addition, it allows tests to pass when there are real errors encountered during change detection.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that errors from `ApplicationRef.tick` are rethrown and will fail the test. We should also do a follow-up investigation to determine whether we can/should also do this for the zone-based `ComponentFixture`.\r\n\r\nfixes #56977\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56993","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): errors during ApplicationRef.tick should be rethrown for zoneless tests\" (#56993)"},{"Id":"2409189756","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T16:49:49","Actor":"zip-fa","Number":"56992","RawContent":null,"Title":"Control flow with defer inside does not clean up before httpClient ends its request","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi.

The presence of the import attribute takes precedence over all other loading behavior including JS/TS and any `loader` build option values. This allows per file control over loading behavior. For general loading for all files of an otherwise unsupported file type, the `loader` build option is recommended.\r\n\r\nFor the import attribute, the following loader values are supported:\r\n* `text` - inlines the content as a string\r\n* `binary` - inlines the content as a Uint8Array\r\n* `file` - emits the file and provides the runtime location of the file\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this time, TypeScript does not support type definitions that are based on import attribute values. The use of `@ts-expect-error` or the use of individual type definition files (assuming the file is only imported with the same loader attribute) is currently required.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TypeScript `module` option must be set to `esnext` to allow TypeScript to successfully build the application code.\r\n\r\nAs an example, an SVG file can be imported as text via:\r\n```\r\n// @ts-expect-error TypeScript cannot provide types based on attributes yet\r\nimport contents from './some-file.svg' with { loader: 'text' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the development server and a file that is referenced from a Node.js package with a loader attribute, the package must be excluded from prebundling via the development server `prebundle` option. This does not apply to relative file references.\r\n\r\nThis feature provides the bundling aspects of #26575. TypeScript type definition support would provide the full feature set for that issue but is currently blocked on TypeScript upstream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28040","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/build): support import attribute based loader configuration\" (#28040)"},{"Id":"2408028960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T07:13:36","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28052","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The dropdown does not open or interact correctly on initial page load. However, once I resize the browser window, the dropdown appears and stays open, but I cannot select any options or close it. After attempting to interact with the dropdown, the entire application hangs, requiring a hard refresh to recover.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nReproduction:\r\nHere’s a specific example of the problematic dropdown within a larger form using Angular reactive forms:\r\n```\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"brands()\">\r\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\r\n    <mat-form-field appearance=\"outline\">\r\n      <mat-label>Brand</mat-label>\r\n      <mat-select formControlName=\"productBrandId\" (selectionChange)=\"onTypeSelected($event.value!)\"\r\n          placeholder=\"product brands\">\r\n        <mat-option *ngFor=\"let brand of brands()\" [value]=\"brand.id\">\r\n          {{brand.name}}\r\n        </mat-option>\r\n      </mat-select>\r\n    </mat-form-field>\r\n  </div>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, ChangeDetectorRef, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { EMPTY } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { catchError, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { ProductService, StorageService } from 'src/app/core/services';\r\nimport { IProduct, IBrand, IProductType, ISizeClassification } from 'src/app/shared/models';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-edit-product',\r\n  templateUrl: './edit-product.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./edit-product.component.scss'],\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class EditProductComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  productForm!: FormGroup;\r\n  // Initialization and methods...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\nI recently removed zone.js and switched to using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush. Before these changes, my project worked well. Here’s how my main.ts is configured:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n  enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, { ngZone: 'noop' })\r\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n```\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nI discovered that this might be a known issue with Angular Material when running in a zoneless configuration. Here are links to related issues on GitHub:\r\n[https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23909](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23909)\r\n[https://github.com/angular/components/issues/9169](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/9169)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up an Angular 18.1.0 application with Angular Material.\r\nRemove zone.js and configure the application to use ngZone: 'noop'.\r\nImplement a form with a mat-select dropdown as shown in the reproduction code.\r\nLoad the application and observe the behavior of the mat-select component.\r\n\r\nAdditional Comments:\r\nAny insights or workarounds to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Angular Material dropdown should open, allow selection of options, and close properly on initial page load without needing to resize the browser window. The application should not hang after interacting with the dropdown.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Angular Material dropdown does not open or display on initial load.\r\nResizing the browser window causes the dropdown to appear and stay open.\r\nOnce open, I cannot select any options or close the dropdown.\r\nClicking on the dropdown or trying other interactions causes the entire app to hang.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular: 18.1.0\r\nAngular Material: 18.1.0\r\nAngular CDK: 18.1.0\r\nng-bootstrap: 17.0.0\r\nTypeScript: 5.5.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29432","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(material/select): Dropdown not interactive in zoneless Angular 18 until browser resize\" (#29432)"},{"Id":"2407550606","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-14T18:37:18","Actor":"whynotavailable","Number":"29431","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Theming Angular Material): theme overrides vs css variables","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThere exists seemingly two ways to implement MDC (or MAT) tokens in scss.

Also I have a master checkbox to select everything in the current filter scope. To support large datasets I also have an option for `virtual scrolling`.\r\n\r\nSince I allow filtering, the source set of the list is constantly changing which clears the selection if an option is filtered out. To prevent this, I use the angular `SelectionModel` and the callbacks of the mat-list-options. But here is the problem:\r\n\r\nSince the options are destroyed and recreated while scrolling through the viewport, the `selectedChange` event of the option is triggered with the initial unselected state of an option, so an option deselects itself when being recreated. But since this does not happen all the time, it seems there is a race between `(selectedChange)` and `[selected]`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-iidbcx\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

But not always --> race\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.0.7\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.6\r\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, common, compiler\r\n... compiler-cli, core, forms, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-selection-list): mat-list-option deselecting itself when recreated in virtual-scroll-viewport\" (#29426)"},{"Id":"2403689410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T21:54:42","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29423","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update getting started","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the Getting Started guide:\r\n- Change links from angular.io to angular.dev\r\n- Update guidance on importing the components (default to standalone guidance)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29423","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update getting started\" (#29423)"},{"Id":"2404074340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T20:36:37","Actor":"urugator","Number":"29425","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/coercion): `coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` has invalid implementation or signature","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` works the same way as `coerceNumberProperty(thing)`, so it yields `0` if the `thing` isn't coercible to number.

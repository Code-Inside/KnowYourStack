Dynamically Loaded Components as Embedded Views\r\n\r\nDear Angular Core Module Developer Community,\r\n\r\nI would like to request enhanced support for lifecycle events in dynamically loaded components when they are used as embedded views. Currently, Angular provides ways to dynamically load components using ViewContainerRef and ComponentFactoryResolver, but lifecycle events such as ngOnInit, ngAfterViewInit, and ngOnDestroy are not automatically triggered for these dynamically loaded components when used as embedded views.\r\n\r\nAs per [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18877), many people have requested a feature to enable creating components without its host wrapper tag also (embedded view). However, from 2017 to the current year 2023, this feature has not been provided by the Angular development community.\r\n\r\nI understand that Angular's current behavior aligns with its design principles and that lifecycle events are meant to be triggered for components created declaratively in the template. However, there are use cases where dynamically loaded components as embedded views are necessary, such as in a Page Builder project or when fully dynamic components with flexbox properties need to be created.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's consider a Page Builder project where users can drag and drop elements and enable flexbox properties through input fields. To take advantage of flexbox properties, the components need to be dynamically loaded as embedded views. However, the lack of lifecycle event support in embedded views poses challenges. For instance, @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators do not work with embedded views. This requires developers to resort to alternative approaches like manually adding event listeners or manipulating classes and attributes using pure JavaScript (e.g., Renderer2 or element.classList).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the absence of lifecycle event support hinders the proper initialization and view initialization of dynamically loaded components as embedded views. This means that ngOnInit and ngAfterViewInit are not fired, preventing the execution of necessary initialization code or interaction with the component's view.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a directive called DynamicComponentLoaderDirective that illustrates the current workaround for dynamically loading components as embedded views:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { ComponentFactoryResolver, ComponentRef, Directive, Injector, Input, OnInit, Type, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[appDynamicComponentLoader]'\r\n})\r\nexport class DynamicComponentLoaderDirective implements OnInit {\r\n  @Input() type!: Type<any>;\r\n  componentRef!: ComponentRef<any>;\r\n\r\n constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver, private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef, private injector: Injector) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.loadComponent();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  loadComponent() {\r\n     const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(this.type);\r\n    if (componentFactory) {\r\n      // this.componentRef = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(componentFactory); // create component & inserts its host view into this container\r\n      this.componentRef = componentFactory.create(this.injector); // create component.\r\n      // this.componentRef.instance.elementData = this.data;\r\n\r\n      if (this.componentRef.instance.childComponentTemplateRef) {\r\n        this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.componentRef.instance.childComponentTemplateRef);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n& use this directive in html for dynamically component load as embedded view\r\n\r\n`\r\n          <ng-template [type]=\"componentType\" [data]=\"elmData\" appDynamicComponentLoader>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n`\r\n\r\nTo see this workaround in action, you can visit [the following StackBlitz link: Angular Dynamic Component as EmbeddedView Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-version-hhnrtf?devToolsHeight=33&file=src%2Fapp%2FpageBuild%2Fdirectives%2Fdynamic-component-loader.directive.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\nHence, I kindly request the Angular Core Module Developer Community to consider providing support for lifecycle events, at the very least for ngOnInit, ngAfterViewInit, and ngOnDestroy, in components loaded as embedded views. This enhancement would greatly improve the flexibility and usability of Angular in scenarios that require dynamic component loading and manipulation of flexbox properties.\r\n\r\nI currently use Angular version 12, but I urge you to consider implementing this lifecycle event support in future versions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this feature request. I appreciate the hard work and dedication of the Angular team and the community in continuously improving the framework.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn that case, if you need to load components as embedded views and still have access to Angular lifecycle events, one possible approach is to create a custom implementation for triggering these lifecycle events manually.\r\n\r\nYou can define a separate interface or base class that includes the necessary lifecycle methods (`ngOnInit`, `ngAfterViewInit`, etc.). Then, when dynamically creating the component as an embedded view, you can instantiate it using this custom interface or base class and manually invoke the corresponding lifecycle methods.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how you can modify the `DynamicComponentLoaderDirective` to implement this approach:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ComponentFactoryResolver, ComponentRef, Directive, Input, OnInit, Type, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CustomLifecycleEvents } from './custom-lifecycle-events';\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[appDynamicComponentLoader]'\r\n})\r\nexport class DynamicComponentLoaderDirective implements OnInit {\r\n  @Input() type!: Type<any>;\r\n  componentRef!: ComponentRef<any>;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver, private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.loadComponent();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  loadComponent() {\r\n    const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(this.type);\r\n    if (componentFactory) {\r\n      this.componentRef = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(componentFactory);\r\n      const componentInstance = this.componentRef.instance as CustomLifecycleEvents;\r\n      if (componentInstance && componentInstance.ngOnInit) {\r\n        componentInstance.ngOnInit();\r\n      }\r\n      if (componentInstance && componentInstance.ngAfterViewInit) {\r\n        componentInstance.ngAfterViewInit();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `CustomLifecycleEvents` is an interface or base class that defines the necessary lifecycle methods. You should replace `CustomLifecycleEvents` with the appropriate name in your implementation.\r\n\r\nBy casting the component instance to `CustomLifecycleEvents`, you can invoke the lifecycle methods if they exist in the loaded component. This way, you can manually trigger the lifecycle events and ensure that the necessary initialization and view-related logic is executed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a workaround solution and may require additional customization based on your specific requirements. It's important to carefully test and verify the behavior of the dynamically loaded components with the manually triggered lifecycle events.\r\n\r\nI hope this updated solution provides a possible approach to address the issue of Angular lifecycle events not working when loading components as embedded views.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nUsing HostView instead of EmbeddedView: Angular recommends using HostView for components rather than EmbeddedView. In this approach, components are loaded using createComponent without using createEmbeddedView. This allows the components to participate in the regular Angular lifecycle and have access to the lifecycle events. However, this approach introduces a host wrapper tag in the DOM structure, which may not be desirable in some scenarios, such as when aiming for a more streamlined and simplified DOM structure.\r\n\r\notherwise, please provide support of Life cycle event for component which is loaded as Embedded View.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51083","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"lifecycle event should works if we create component as Embedded View Instead of HostView\" (#51083)"},{"Id":"1809713454","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T11:12:13","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"51082","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): disallow reactive node creation in consumer context","State":"open","Body":"This change introduces a check around reactive node creation.

R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule) When Testing with Standalone Component from Library","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThis took a while to narrow down to something I could isolate / re-create.  If I create a standalone component that uses `MatTooltipModule` in a library, and then use that library/component from within a component in an Angular app that doesn't also import `MatTooltipModule`, I get the following `NullInjectorError` when I run unit tests:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nNullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy -> InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy]:\r\n      NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy!\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy` is an injection token provided by `MatTooltipModule`.  Now, if I build the same component locally in the app, and then use that component in another component, I don't face the issue at all.  It only seems to be when using it from a library.  This also doesn't throw an error at runtime.  It only seems to present itself when testing.  It also works, if I import `MatTooltipModule` again from the component that's using the library-based component.  But I wouldn't expect it to need that, since both are standalone and the component that's using the tooltip imports it.   Not sure if this is relevant, but we use `jest` for testing (with the `jest-preset-angular` library for our config).  \r\n\r\nI managed to recreate this in the attached repo, which demonstrates that the locally built component set up works, while the library-built version of the same component doesn't work.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/michaelfaith/angular-nullinjector-bug\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy -> InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy]:\r\n      NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken mat-tooltip-scroll-strategy!\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.1.4\r\nNode: 16.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.5\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.4\r\nng-packagr                      16.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI found these issues, which involved similar errors, but didn't have the exact same situation as ours (where's it's working when built locally, but not when built in a library).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35759\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47448\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50312","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51070","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule) When Testing with Standalone Component from Library\" (#51070)"},{"Id":"1807934679","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-17T14:38:10","Actor":"liamdebeasi","Number":"51068","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug: bundled domino incorrectly returns undefined instead of null for querySelector","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-server\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe version of Domino bundled with Angular returns `undefined` instead of `null` for `querySelector`. \r\n\r\nThis is causing deprecation warnings in Ionic to be incorrectly logged since we expect `querySelector` to return either the Element or `null` [as per the `Element.querySelector` spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element/querySelector).\r\n\r\nIonic issue: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/27564\r\nRelevant Ionic code: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/721fc6fd9a21c9c03bb21d290e9b1bbd703e43e3/core/src/components/item/item.tsx#L218\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.

This is a partial implementation of the popular [CSS modules](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules) approach for avoiding unintentional name collisions in CSS. I'm not calling this feature \"CSS modules\" because although some people in the community call it that, other people in the community have started using \"CSS modules\" to refer to [something completely different](https://togithub.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/60c9f682b63c622bfa0d8222ea6b1f3b659e007c/proposals/css-modules-v1-explainer.md) and now CSS modules is an overloaded term.\n\n    Here's how this new local CSS name feature works with esbuild:\n\n    -   Identifiers that look like `.className` and `#idName` are global with the `global-css` loader and local with the `local-css` loader. Global identifiers are the same across all files (the way CSS normally works) but local identifiers are different between different files. If two separate CSS files use the same local identifier `.button`, esbuild will automatically rename one of them so that they don't collide. This is analogous to how esbuild automatically renames JS local variables with the same name in separate JS files to avoid name collisions.\n\n    -   It only makes sense to use local CSS names with esbuild when you are also using esbuild's bundler to bundle JS files that import CSS files. When you do that, esbuild will generate one export for each local name in the CSS file. The JS code can import these names and use them when constructing HTML DOM. For example:\n\n        ```js\n        // app.js\n        import { outerShell } from './app.css'\n        const div = document.createElement('div')\n        div.className = outerShell\n        document.body.appendChild(div)\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* app.css */\n        .outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        When you bundle this with `esbuild app.js --bundle --loader:.css=local-css --outdir=out` you'll now get this (notice how the local CSS name `outerShell` has been renamed):\n\n        ```js\n        // out/app.js\n        (() => {\n          // app.css\n          var outerShell = \"app_outerShell\";\n\n          // app.js\n          var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n          div.className = outerShell;\n          document.body.appendChild(div);\n        })();\n        ```\n\n        ```css\n        /* out/app.css */\n        .app_outerShell {\n          position: absolute;\n          inset: 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        This feature only makes sense to use when bundling is enabled both because your code needs to `import` the renamed local names so that it can use them, and because esbuild needs to be able to process all CSS files containing local names in a single bundling operation so that it can successfully rename conflicting local names to avoid collisions.\n\n    -   If you are in a global CSS file (with the `global-css` loader) you can create a local name using `:local()`, and if you are in a local CSS file (with the `local-css` loader) you can create a global name with `:global()`. So the choice of the `global-css` loader vs. the `local-css` loader just sets the default behavior for identifiers, but you can override it on a case-by-case basis as necessary. For example:\n\n        ```css\n        :local(.button) {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        :global(.button) {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Processing this CSS file with esbuild with either the `global-css` or `local-css` loader will result in something like this:\n\n        ```css\n        .stdin_button {\n          color: red;\n        }\n        .button {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   The names that esbuild generates for local CSS names are an implementation detail and are not intended to be hard-coded anywhere. The only way you should be referencing the local CSS names in your JS or HTML is with an `import` statement in JS that is bundled with esbuild, as demonstrated above. For example, when `--minify` is enabled esbuild will use a different name generation algorithm which generates names that are as short as possible (analogous to how esbuild minifies local identifiers in JS).\n\n    -   You can easily use both global CSS files and local CSS files simultaneously if you give them different file extensions. For example, you could pass `--loader:.css=global-css` and `--loader:.module.css=local-css` to esbuild so that `.css` files still use global names by default but `.module.css` files use local names by default.\n\n    -   Keep in mind that the `css` loader is different than the `global-css` loader. The `:local` and `:global` annotations are not enabled with the `css` loader and will be passed through unchanged. This allows you to have the option of using esbuild to process CSS containing while preserving these annotations. It also means that local CSS names are disabled by default for now (since the `css` loader is currently the default for CSS files). The `:local` and `:global` syntax may be enabled by default in a future release.\n\n    Note that esbuild's implementation does not currently have feature parity with other implementations of modular CSS in similar tools. This is only a preliminary release with a partial implementation that includes some basic behavior to get the process started. Additional behavior may be added in future releases. In particular, this release does not implement:\n\n    -   The `composes` pragma\n    -   Tree shaking for unused local CSS\n    -   Local names for keyframe animations, grid lines, `@container`, `@counter-style`, etc.\n\n    Issue [#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20) (the issue for this feature) is esbuild's most-upvoted issue! While this release still leaves that issue open, it's an important first step in that direction.\n\n-   Parse `:is`, `:has`, `:not`, and `:where` in CSS\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse the contents of these pseudo-class selectors as a selector list. This means you will now get syntax warnings within these selectors for invalid selector syntax. It also means that esbuild's CSS nesting transform behaves slightly differently than before because esbuild is now operating on an AST instead of a token stream. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      :where(.foo&) {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(.foo:is(div)) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :where(div.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack (webpack)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.88.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.88.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fixed a bug where unused identifiers should retain names when using css modules by [@&#8203;burhanuday](https://togithub.com/burhanuday) in [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/pull/17444)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.88.1...v5.88.2\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Its support for passing multiple entry points is especially interesting.\r\n\r\nScenario: I'm building a regular old website (MPA), documentation for a component library. There are over 100 components, with each multiple examples that I'd like to run live on the site.\r\nThe documentation site is not an Angular SPA, but set up via a \"markdown -> static site\" generator ([mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nExpose the internal application builder function, allowing me to build the entire documentation with multiple entry-pointsâ€”each with its own bootstrapâ€”in one go.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default createBuilder((input, context) =>\r\n\tbuildApplicationInternal( // <-- using internal import here\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\twatch: false,\r\n\t\t\tprogress: false,\r\n\r\n\t\t\tindex: false,\r\n\t\t\tentryPoints: collectEntryPoints(context),\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// more options\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcontext,\r\n\t),\r\n);\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPast solutions for our documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Make the documentation a regular angular app. That's how we started out, turns out no one likes writing documentation like this.\r\n2. Copy the aio setup from angular/angular and make our own \"markdown pages -> angular app\" pipeline. Tried that, but the setup of aio is&hellip; not the easiest to understand or maintain if you're not used to it.\r\n3. Use storybook. That's where we're currently at.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to exposing the internal application builder function:\r\n\r\n4. Build every page into a separate angular app. This makes the build prohibitively slow.\r\n5. Build a single angular app with bootstraps for every documentation page. This would either load all code for all pages for any page, or it would require quite a lot of shenanigans to ensure we don't load all that superfluous javascript over a shabby internal corporate proxy server.\r\n6. Make the multiple entry points available in the existing experimental application builder's schema. For me this solution would work equally well, but I believe the use case (running angular in an MPA) to be so different from what a regular angular app looks like that adding the option will only lead to confusion for developers who just want to build SPAs.\r\n7. Make a separate \"MPA application\" builder. This puts the onus on the angular team to properly support building Angular MPAs, which I don't expect to align with the goals of the framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose internal application builder function\" (#25556)"},{"Id":"1810397018","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T20:10:11","Actor":"HerRA17","Number":"25554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Trying to use ng command and I get this two sort of errors: npm ERR!

For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV && doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild --define:DEV=true`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --define:DEV=false`\n\n    One drawback of this approach is that the resulting code crashes if you don't provide a value for `DEV` with `--define:`. In practice this isn't that big of a problem, and there are also various ways to work around this.\n\n    However, another approach that avoids this drawback is to use JavaScript label statements instead. That's what the `--drop-labels=` flag implements. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV: doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, you can now build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --drop-labels=DEV`\n\n    This means that code containing optional development-only checks can now be written such that it's safe to run without any additional configuration. The `--drop-labels=` flag takes comma-separated list of multiple label names to drop.\n\n-   Avoid causing `unhandledRejection` during shutdown ([#&#8203;3219](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3219))\n\n    All pending esbuild JavaScript API calls are supposed to fail if esbuild's underlying child process is unexpectedly terminated. This can happen if `SIGINT` is sent to the parent `node` process with Ctrl+C, for example. Previously doing this could also cause an unhandled promise rejection when esbuild attempted to communicate this failure to its own child process that no longer exists. This release now swallows this communication failure, which should prevent this internal unhandled promise rejection. This change means that you can now use esbuild's JavaScript API with a custom `SIGINT` handler that extends the lifetime of the `node` process without esbuild's internals causing an early exit due to an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n-   Update browser compatibility table scripts\n\n    The scripts that esbuild uses to compile its internal browser compatibility table have been overhauled. Briefly:\n\n    -   Converted from JavaScript to TypeScript\n    -   Fixed some bugs that resulted in small changes to the table\n    -   Added [`caniuse-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caniuse-lite) and [`@mdn/browser-compat-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;mdn/browser-compat-data) as new data sources (replacing manually-copied information)\n\n    This change means it's now much easier to keep esbuild's internal compatibility tables up to date. You can review the table changes here if you need to debug something about this change:\n\n    -   [JS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/d259b8fac717ee347c19bd8299f2c26d7c87481a...af1d35c372f78c14f364b63e819fd69548508f55#diff-1649eb68992c79753469f02c097de309adaf7231b45cc816c50bf751af400eb4)\n    -   [CSS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/commit/95feb2e09877597cb929469ce43811bdf11f50c1#diff-4e1c4f269e02c5ea31cbd5138d66751e32cf0e240524ee8a966ac756f0e3c3cd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.45.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.45.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.44.0...v8.45.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`cdd063c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/cdd063c388bbfe1781d7a864a832f03a2c1cc277) feat: Expose LegacyESLint in unsupported API ([#&#8203;17341](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17341)) (Nicholas C.

Unfortunately, the Sass compiler does not provided the importer file to import plugins. Previously to workaround this issue, all previously resolved stylesheets were tried as the importer path. This allowed the stylesheets to be resolved but it also could cause a potentially large increase in build time due to the amount of previous stylesheets that would need to be tried. To avoid the performance impact and to also provide more accurate information regarding the importer file, a lexer is now used to extract import information for a stylesheet and inject the importer file path into the specifier. This information is then extracted from the import specifier during the Sass resolution process and allows the underlying package resolution access to a viable location to resolve the package for all package managers.

Here's a minimal example that triggers this edge case:\n\n    ```ts\n    (() => {\n      const enum E { a };\n      () => E.a\n    })\n    ```\n\n-   Allow a newline in the middle of TypeScript `export type` statement ([#&#8203;3225](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3225))\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly rejected the following valid TypeScript code:\n\n    ```ts\n    export type\n    { T };\n\n    export type\n    * as foo from 'bar';\n    ```\n\n    Code that uses a newline after `export type` is now allowed starting with this release.\n\n-   Fix cross-module inlining of string enums ([#&#8203;3210](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3210))\n\n    A refactoring typo in version 0.18.9 accidentally introduced a regression with cross-module inlining of string enums when combined with computed property accesses. This regression has been fixed.\n\n-   Rewrite `.js` to `.ts` inside packages with `exports` ([#&#8203;3201](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3201))\n\n    Packages with the `exports` field are supposed to disable node's path resolution behavior that allows you to import a file with a different extension than the one in the source code (for example, importing `foo/bar` to get `foo/bar.js`). And TypeScript has behavior where you can import a non-existent `.js` file and you will get the `.ts` file instead. Previously the presence of the `exports` field caused esbuild to disable all extension manipulation stuff which included both node's implicit file extension searching and TypeScript's file extension swapping. However, TypeScript appears to always apply file extension swapping even in this case. So with this release, esbuild will now rewrite `.js` to `.ts` even inside packages with `exports`.\n\n-   Fix a redirect edge case in esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;3208](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3208))\n\n    The development server canonicalizes directory URLs by adding a trailing slash. For example, visiting `/about` redirects to `/about/` if `/about/index.html` would be served. However, if the requested path begins with two slashes, then the redirect incorrectly turned into a protocol-relative URL. For example, visiting `//about` redirected to `//about/` which the browser turns into `http://about/`. This release fixes the bug by canonicalizing the URL path when doing this redirect.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.26`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#8426)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.25...8.4.26)\n\n-   Fixed clone methods types.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But it doesn't work if you are using a backdrop.

There is no way to get the current overlay of the dialog to dispose of it manually  (See #15840).\r\n\r\nI could find a workaround ([TestDialog02Component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest-dialog-02%2Ftest-dialog-02.component.ts)) by not using the built-in backdrop and creating a custom overlay.

Our code is utilizing `queueMicrotask` as part of initialization. When opening an `XMLHttpRequest` within a subsequent microtask the browser CPU spikes due to recursively calling `queueMicrotask`. This only happens on Zone-enabled sites.\n\nTo reproduce, paste the following code into the console on one of the following sites: LandsEnd.com, Avery.com, PapaGinos.com:\n\n```\n(function() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  let _isDispatching = false;\n  function run() {\n    function dispatch(event) {\n      console.log(\"in dispatch for loggerString\", event);\n      if (_isDispatching) {\n        console.log(\"already dispatching, queuing string\", event);\n        queueMicrotask(() => dispatch(event));\n        console.log(\"queued string\", event);\n        return;\n      }\n      _isDispatching = true;\n      if (event === \"init\") {\n        dispatch(\"extra event\");\n        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.open(\"GET\", \"google.com\", true);\n      }\n      _isDispatching = false;\n    }\n    dispatch(\"init\");\n  }\n  run();\n})();\n```\n\nIn attempting to create as small a reproduction as possible, I used a stock CLI app and was able to recreate the issue with a larger piece of code. However, once narrowing down to this smaller example code, we weren't able to replicate in a toy app. Happy to attempt to help find out more about the incompatibility, but right now this is as far as we were able to get in terms of narrowing down the use case.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\n    `Injector.get`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

This contradicts the behavior of statically declared components, which correctly resolve @ Host() dependencies from the host’s viewProviders.\n\n\nLet's say we have AnimalService:\n```\n@Injectable({providedIn:'root'})\nexport class AnimalService{\n public name='Whale';\n}\n\n```\n\n\nAnd a component that needs AnimalService to be provided from the view of the host:\n```\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-dynamic',\n template:` <div> {{ animal?.name  }} </div> `\n ... \n})\nexport class DynamicComponent{\n constructor(@Host() public animal:AnimalService){}\n}\n\n```\n\n\nAnd a host component that renders app-dynamic dynamically and provide the AnimalService in its viewProviders array:\n```\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-wrapper',\n template:` <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"comp\"></ng-container> `,\n viewProviders:[{\n  provide:AnimalService,\n  useValue:{\n   name:'Tiger'\n  }\n }]\n ...\n})\nexport class DynamicComponent{\n  comp:Type<DynamicComponent>=DynamicComponent\n}\n\n```\n\nThe dynamically created component DynamicComponent can't resolve AnimalService from the view of the host.\nBut if we call the app-dynamic component statically, it can resolve AnimalService from the viewProviders of its host as expected.\n\nIt seems like the dynamically created component acts like a root element and doesn't have a parent node injector.\nActually, the supposed parent node injector seems to be chained with the environment injector through the ChainedInjector.\n\n\n**Observed Result:**\nERROR RuntimeError: NG0201: No provider for AnimalService found in NodeInjector.\n\n**Expected Result:**\nDynamicComponent should receive the AnimalService instance from the host’s viewProviders (Tiger), just like it does when declared statically in the template.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR RuntimeError: NG0201: No provider for AnimalService found in NodeInjector.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't resolve @Host() restricted dependencies with dynamically created components from parent node injector\" (#60730)"},{"Id":"2969536952","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T13:09:34","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60728","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): reduce `navigator.userAgent` checks size","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we move `navigator.userAgent` into a variable and reuse it in multiple places.

(tableVersion.xAxis.rowCount - (tableVersionHeader.level ?? 0)) : 1\n         }\">\n      <p>{{tableVersionHeader.headerVersion?.code}} - {{tableVersionHeader.headerVersion?.label}}</p>\n      <p>grid-column: {{tableVersionHeader.columnIndex + 2}} / span {{tableVersionHeader.breadth}}</p>\n      <p>grid-row: {{tableVersionHeader.level}} / span {{((tableVersionHeader.children!.length === 0 || !tableVersionHeader.isAbstract)) ?

I double checked with Firefox and Chrome, both show the same behaviour.\n\nThanks for your help in advance.\n\nStackblitz example code https://angular-3plybjxk.stackblitz.io/\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://angular-3plybjxk.stackblitz.io/\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.5\nNode: 23.5.0 (Unsupported)\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.5\n@angular/cli                    19.2.5\n@angular/ssr                    19.2.5\n@schematics/angular             19.2.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60727","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"display grid behaviour\" (#60727)"},{"Id":"2969024222","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T10:08:33","Actor":"mgirolet-gl","Number":"60726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Force a pipe to be recomputed from within its code","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nAs per suggested by #15041 in 2017, it would be convenient to be allowed to trigger pipes manually for computation.\n\n#15041 was however closed:\n> Looking into this (and similar) issues it sounds like we are looking for using a pipe as something akin to computed properties. We do consider a more generic solution. Since we are getting multiple issues / feature requests around computed properties, we've opened a canonical issue #47553 to track this use-case.\n\n#47553 has since been closed too:\n> We do have computed properties with signals now!\n\nYet, I don't see any way signals can be used to solve #15041, which has since been locked for inactivity.\n\n\nHere's a practical use case, as an **example**:\n```typescript\n@Pipe({\n    name: 'sortByTranslation'\n})\nexport class SortByTranslationPipe implements PipeTransform, OnDestroy {\n    private translateSub: any = null;\n\n    constructor(private readonly translateService: TranslateService) { }\n\n    ngOnDestroy(): void {\n        if (this.translateSub !== null) this.translateSub.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    transform(input: string[]): any {\n        input.sort((a: string, b: string) => {\n            // Yes, this is heavily unoptimized, we recalculate translations on every comparison, you might want to use a dictionnary or something.\n            // It doesn't matter, though: point is, you get data from an external source, and that data might change at any time.\n            const aV = this.translateService.instant(a);\n            const bV = this.translateService.instant(b);\n\n            if (aV < bV)\n                return -1;\n            else if (aV > bV)\n                return 1;\n            else\n                return 0;\n        });\n\n        if (this.translateSub === null) {\n            this.translateSub = this.translateService.onLangChange.subscribe((value) => {\n                /* TODO: manually trigger the pipe to be refreshed here!!! */\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, we want to sort an array of translation keys alphabetically, depending on their actual translation value provided by some resource (here, a translation service).\n\nHowever, if we change of language, we'd want to recompute the result of this pipe's ``transform`` function, which we can't do as of right now:\n- ``ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`` and ``ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`` do not detect any change and therefore won't refresh the pipe\n- There's no function in the ``PipeTransform`` interface that'd allow a forced recomputation\n\nI'm using translations as an example here, but this could be applied to any callback-based data received from an external service of any kind.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEither add a function / event emitter to pipes to refresh it, or add a public function to its ``ChangeDetectorRef`` to force it to be marked as changed, even if it doesn't detect changes by itself.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis could supposedly be solved by adding ``pure: false``, but this would **NOT** be a good alternative: it would result in maaaaany unnecessary computations (or even \"too many recursion\" errors in some cases)\n\nWe don't want to recalculate data on the slightest change of anything, only when some callback we got control of is executed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60726","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Force a pipe to be recomputed from within its code\" (#60726)"},{"Id":"2968578184","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T07:33:25","Actor":"5B4AON","Number":"60723","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deeplinking not working on ng serve for Angular 19","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen run with ng serve when we open a new browser tab and type the address of a page for which there is proper router configuration we always get back the default page.\nRouting works through routerLink commands within the same tab.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular router 19.0.0\nAngular cli 19.05\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60723","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Deeplinking not working on ng serve for Angular 19\" (#60723)"},{"Id":"2968605729","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T07:33:10","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"60724","RawContent":null,"Title":"Selectorless template parsing","State":"open","Body":"⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️ this PR implements syntax that is still being designed and discussed.

Based on the documentation, the following should apply:\n\n“The hydrate on hover trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content when the mouse has hovered over the triggered area through the mouseenter, mouseover and focusin events.”\n\nHowever, I'm not observing any hydration on hover, and inspecting the DOM shows that no event listeners are attached to the dehydrated block.\n\n✅ Setup\nMy app uses:\nprovideClientHydration(withIncrementalHydration())\n\nIn the template:\n\n@defer (hydrate on hover) {\n  <app-hydration-check></app-hydration-check>\n} @placeholder {\n  <div>Loading...</div>\n}\nThis SSR-renders the <app-hydration-check> element, and the placeholder is not shown (expected ✅). However, on the client:\n\nThe component remains dehydrated\n\nHovering the area does not trigger hydration\n\n🔬 Investigation\nAfter analyzing Angular’s runtime (via monkey-patching addEventListener, DOM inspection, and source exploration), I found:\n\n@defer (on hover) correctly adds eventlisteners:\n\nBut with hydrate on hover elements never hydrated (hover, click, nothing helps)\n\nI confirmed that hydration data is in TransferState under __ngDeferData__\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc65e7a-9304-4871-b1b3-97ac4bfe925b)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b784a0e1-879b-46ee-b2b3-40419e47a009)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb58ae09-cbc1-4ea0-bc4f-61755b86f372)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb6285e-24d6-4e1e-8526-f1e78e6a5017)\n\n🧪 Suggested Debug Tooling\nIt would be helpful to expose a debug utility (in dev mode) that can:\n\nList all dehydrated blocks (d0, d1, …)\nShow which event triggers are registered\nLog when hydration is triggered and on which DOM element\n\nThis would greatly improve DX for incremental hydration debugging.\n\n✅ Expected Behavior\n@defer (hydrate on hover) or @defer (hydrate on interaction) should:\n\nAttach listeners to the appropriate element\nTrigger hydration via proper events\n\n🙏 Request\nCould you confirm whether:\nhydrate on hover is supposed to generate jsaction and ngb attributes?\nThere’s a best practice for debugging which defer blocks are dehydrated + waiting?\n\nP.S. Also I am not yet started to debug my viewport hydration issues on dynamically created elements\n\nThanks for your awesome work on Angular and for the powerful hydration system! 🙌\n\n### Please

Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>angular/angular (@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\r\n\r\n### [`v20.0.0-next.5`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next5-2025-04-02)\r\n\r\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n##### core\r\n\r\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\r\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\r\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\r\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\r\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\r\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\r\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\r\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\r\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\r\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\r\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\r\n\r\n##### router\r\n\r\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\r\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\r\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\r\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\r\n    `Injector.get`.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecations\r\n\r\n##### core\r\n\r\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\r\n\r\n#####\r\n\r\n| Commit | Type | Description |\r\n| -- | -- | -- |\r\n|

Projects will automatically use this naming convention. Projects can however opt-out by setting the `typeSeparator` option to `.` for the pipe schematic. This can be done as a default in the `angular.json` or directly on the commandline via `--type-separator=.` when executing `ng generate`. As an example, `example.pipe.ts` will now be named `example-pipe.ts`.

The error is thrown from invalidTypeError in test_bed_compiler.ts.  As far as I could tell, the getAnnotation function in the resolver was returning null instead of Component, causing the error to be tripped.  I assume the AOT build is stripping this metadata/the decorator before this check is made.  I couldn't find any way to work around the issue other than rearchitecting my component so that I was no longer needing to make the  overrideComponent call.  As long as overrideComponent was in the stack at all, regardless of what parameters I passed to it, the tests failed due to missing metadata.\n\nI have not tested any of the other types of overrides, but given that most of the code in the TestBed compiler is in common between the decorated types, I would assume they all are impacted in AOT mode.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple valid component, turn on AOT for Karma, and make a test where you use TestBed.overrideComponent to reset metadata.  You don't even need to specify an actual override in the second parameter to trigger the issue: TestBed.overrideComponent(YourComponent, {}) triggers the failure.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n_<class name> class doesn't have @Component decorator or is missing metadata.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30017","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"New AOT option for Karma doesn't play nicely with TestBed.overrideComponent\" (#30017)"},{"Id":"2969860042","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T18:34:52","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30021","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): include component test metadata in development builds","State":"closed","Body":"To support the usage of AOT with unit tests, development builds of applications will now include injected calls to the internal Angular `setClassMetadata` function.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.5`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next5-2025-04-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\n    `Injector.get`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Looking into the output of \"ng test\" with code coverage enabled, I found that the number of statements and lines touched roughly doubled compared to when I run the same tests with AOT turned off.  By looking at the files generated by karma-coverage, I found that in AOT mode the component HTML files are also being instrumented for code coverage now.  I assume this is because AOT mode compiles the templates into the Javascript for test execution.\n\nWas this intentional?  If it was, at the very least it probably should have been mentioned in the release notes.  I can't find any way to configure the codeCoverageExclude options to omit the component HTML files.  I would imagine nearly every app will see a drop in their code coverage as a result of this difference, especially given that most of the IDE tooling around code coverage doesn't even consider the possibility that HTML files would be included.  It's also not obvious at all how to cover the HTML; I have files that are listed as fully covered with basically no difference in the tests compared to ones that aren't marked as covered at all.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple component with a simple test and run Karma with code coverage enabled both with AOT enabled and AOT disabled.  With AOT enabled, the component HTML will be instrumented in addition to the Typescript.  With AOT disabled, only the Typescript is instrumented.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New AOT options for Karma also run code coverage on component HTML files\" (#30016)"},{"Id":"2967430008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T21:04:00","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30014","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30014","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30014)"},{"Id":"2967480906","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T20:50:16","Actor":"pawel-twardziak","Number":"30015","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Linter] Add support for Biome","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nI am guessing it is the right time for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to be supported by Angular workspace - what do you think guys?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement the support as an alternative for eslint/prettier\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDo not implement it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30015","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Linter] Add support for Biome\" (#30015)"},{"Id":"2967181454","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T18:20:52","Actor":"wcwcaseman","Number":"30013","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please add a flag to suppress the warning, Add only entry points to the 'files' or 'include' properties in your tsconfig.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn my NX Angular project I add entry points in webpack.

We 've come across on problems that our application started to becoming slow after switching between different screens/routes after a while. It turned out to be memory leaks (Detached nodes that are not garbage collected) and some of the leaks we 've managed to fix because of missing unsubscribtion in our application but others we can't fix and seems to be input and mat-form-field related. We've implemented a workaround that we reload page when memory hits defined limit so we can still deliver a product however angular material related memory leaks are beyond our control.\n\n\n**Description:**\nFirst of all I've created a simple example project that has two screens each in separate module screen-one.module.ts and screen-two.module.ts and those modules are lazy loaded and has its own routes 'screen-one'  and 'screen-two'. Screen one is just empty screen so it doesn't have memory leaks and is used as reference and screen two contains some material components. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nExample 1: [StackBlitz Material input example](https://stackblitz.com/github/EverydayWebDev/simple-material-project/tree/mat-input)\nScreen two contains only mat-form-field with nested input.\n1. Start with Screen One\n2. Navigate to screen two by clicking Screen Two button on left menu\n3. Navigate back to Screen One by clicking on menu button\n4. Open Chrome Dev tools navigate to the memory tab (in case of stackblitz select VM instance webcontainer) and take a heap snapshot\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18d6746b-d617-4369-8b4f-17b684e6909b)\n\nActual Behavior:\nDev tools memory profiling shows 1 Detached Node <div class=\"mat-form-field-flex\" DOM that wasn't garbage collected. Fortunately If I repeat reproduction steps again and again the number of detached <div class=\"mat-form-field-flex\" remains the same.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a47c48-ff32-4537-81fa-cefbe9270ae8)\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAll input and mat-form-field related detached DOM nodes are not present in memory.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nExample 2: [StackBlitz Material input with mat-tab example](https://stackblitz.com/github/EverydayWebDev/simple-material-project/tree/mat-tab)\nScreen two contains only mat-form-field with input that is wrapped with mat-tab and mat-tab-group \n1. Start with Screen One\n2. Navigate to screen two by clicking Screen Two button on left menu\n3. Navigate back to Screen One by clicking on menu button\n4.

I've mange to narrow it down the css filters when they are applied to html or body element causing the issue. With css filters present on Chrome, when the BottomSheet appear, it resizes the view instead of sliding into view. \n\nTo reproduce: ng new filteproject.  ng add @angular/material . Following the Material io example and add a BottomSheet and open button to the default project page.\n\nAdd  backdrop-filter: brightness(1); to styles.css body\n\n`body { \n  margin: 0; font-family: Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\n  backdrop-filter: brightness(1);\n} `\n\nTrigger the bottomshett and you will a page flicker on Chrome. It works fine in Safari and worked fine in Angular 18 on Chrome.\n\nIf you add a DIV between body and app-root, and apply filters to it, the issue goes away. but BottomSheet and dialog are not affected by the filters anymore. I use filters to create dim the entire document <body> or <html> as a night mode feature.\n\nLooks like its an overlay context issue or something. Not experienced enough to explain it better !\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bapgtgzq?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

It then slides over body and resizes the page as it moves to it final position. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.5\nNode: 18.20.7\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular:

I have an application that one of the buttons has a tooltip. When a user uses tab to focus the button, the tooltip shows up as expected. After an user clicks Enter, it invokes an internal handler that trigger an asynchronous  task and I need to hide the tooltip because the button should take no action before the async task ends. I could observe that the tooltip is hidden as expected when I set the message to an empty string. However, after my internal handler finishes, I try to display the tooltip message again by giving it a new non-empty  string. It doesn't get displayed as expected.  \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-syyarrqo?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n1. Click Tab once to make the focus lands on the \"Add\" button. You could see the tooltip is shown now. \n2. Click Enter. The tooltip is now hidden because the Enter's handler set the tooltip message to an empty string\n3. Wait for a sec and observe. Step 2 also kicks off an async handler that changes the tooltip message after a second.\n4.

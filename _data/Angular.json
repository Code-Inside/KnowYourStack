I [asked on the Angular Discord](https://discord.com/channels/748677963142135818/749140853921939507/1254227088756576289) where to post and this was the best guess.\r\n\r\nAngular uses [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) for its internal linting ([`tslint.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/49b2e65bfb097b25da09870ca8a07650812e3d68/tslint.json)) right now, although [TSLint was deprecated years ago](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534). TSLint doesn't support all new TypeScript features and hasn't been actively worked on since 2020. Its replacement is [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io).\r\n\r\nSome related issues & PRs from searching [`tslint in:title`](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues?q=tslint+in%3Atitle):\r\n* #37843 -> https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13732: user-facing, not the same as this one\r\n* #42639: user-facing, not the same as this one\r\n* #42820: only part of the way\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose incrementally switching over to ESLint. One common strategy many repositories go with is:\r\n\r\n1. Add ESLint separately from TSLint, integrated into the same build processes\r\n    * Tip: https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint\r\n3. Remove old _built-in_ rules from the TSLint config and replace them with their new ESLint equivalents\r\n    * Tip: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config is the standard helper there\r\n4. Remove old _custom_ and _plugin_ rules from the TSLint config and rewrite and/or replace them with new custom and/or plugin equivalents\r\n    * Tip: for anything that can be generalized, this is a great time for adding a new or existing `eslint-plugin-*` package!\r\n5. Once there are no more TSLint rules in use, remove it altogether\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to help with this! \"Killing TSLint\" is IMO helpful for the ecosystem: both to get projects on the latest+greatest tooling, and to help get more community input into ESLint + typescript-eslint.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI suppose Angular could stay on TSLint in perpetuity, which would be a real bummer. Or even fork the old TSLint codebase - structural issues and all.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be a linter besides ESLint. There are some Rust-based ones such as [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), [`deno lint`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/linter), and [Oxc / `oxlint`](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) - though none yet support [linting with type information](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting) yet.

Change the behavior: Adjust the existing teardown configuration to allow more flexibility in how components are destroyed before or after each test. This could involve changing the type check to accommodate more use cases.\r\n\r\n2. Add support for a destroyBeforeEach option: Introduce a new option destroyBeforeEach in the teardown configuration. This would allow explicit control over the destruction behavior, enabling developers to configure whether the component should be destroyed before each test, after each test, or not at all.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\n- Flexibility: Developers will have more control over the lifecycle of components during testing.\r\n- Maintainability: Reduces the need for hacks or workarounds, making the test configurations cleaner and more maintainable.\r\n- Improved Testing Experience: Allows for more precise setup and teardown processes, improving the reliability and efficiency of tests.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe hack we have in place works for now, but would love to see this get baked into the framework!\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.

in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter the implementation of the keyboard interaction in v18 (#28548) we spotted a small issue with the behavior when there are disabled buttons in the `mat-button-toggle-group`. While navigating the selection in the group via keyboard, the selection can move into the disabled buttons and then stops, preventing the navigation to the rest of the items after the disabled button. Also, visually it looks like both disabled and the previous button are highlighted.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/21110003/00231057-b1e6-442d-b607-f5413a07dbbe)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ywl3wm-hddgcz?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbutton-toggle-overview-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the example [provided in Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ywl3wm-hddgcz?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbutton-toggle-overview-example.html)\r\n2. Set the focus on the mat-button-toggle component. (e.g. Press tab until you reach it, or simply click on the first item)\r\n3. Use the arrow keys (either left/right or up/down) to navigate through the items.\r\n4. Observe that the disabled button receives focus and gets selected.\r\n\r\nExtra notes:\r\nWhile the selection is on the disabled item, if you hit Space or Enter the selection will move back to the previous active item.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBy using the arrow keys, the selection should rotate around the active buttons and ignore the disabled ones.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe selection allows selecting a disabled button, and once selected, it cannot move the selection further. When attempting to move back, the selection jumps over one item.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g.

navigation in mat tabs","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am shipping my Angular app using Material inside an APK as a TWA. It should be compatible with Android TV so I am testing the behaviour on Chromecast 2 using the dpad controller. Only available controls are the 4 directional arrows with Back and Enter.\r\nMy first page has a mat-tab-nav-bar at the top. On page load, the Chromecast browser focuses the first element and then let the user navigate in the page only using the previously listed controls. \r\nAs mat tabs enables keyboard navigation, it is switching tabs focus with arrow keys and changing active tab with Enter. But because dpads is missing Tab key, it becomes impossible to focus out the tabs and click on next elements.\r\nWe would need a way to configure the mat tabs to focus to next elements with arrows when last element has been reached instead of looping back to the first tab. That would allow dpad to navigate to the rest of the page.\r\nAny known hack to make this work would be more than welcome!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples#tab-group-align\r\nSteps to reproduce the same behaviour in a browser:\r\n1. Use tab to enter focus on first tabs bar\r\n2. Use only arrows and Enter and try to navigate in the whole page\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to next element (like a Tab) instead of going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to previous element (like a Shift+Tab) instead of going to last tab element.\r\nThis could be done with some config maybe to stay compatible with current behaviour\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed it is going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressedit is going to last tab element.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18\r\n- CDK/Material: 18\r\n- Browser(s): Chromecast browser\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android TV\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29284","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-tab-nav-bar): Accessibility issue with dpad navigation in mat tabs\" (#29284)"},{"Id":"2363996056","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:41:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29290","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29290","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.\" (#29290)"},{"Id":"2363978014","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:32:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29289","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29289","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.4 release\" (#29289)"},{"Id":"2363975132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:29:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29288","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29288","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.4\" with changelog.\" (#29288)"},{"Id":"2363947003","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T09:16:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29287","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): avoid losing focus when re-rendering the current view","State":"open","Body":"When some calendar inputs change, we need to re-render the entire view (e.g. `minDate` or `dateFilter`).

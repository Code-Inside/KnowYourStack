Once a promise is created, it will either resolve or reject, and it doesn't provide a built-in mechanism to cancel it.\r\nThere may be situations where a promise is provided, and it either resolves after the pipe has been destroyed or never resolves at all. If the promise never resolves — potentially due to factors beyond our control, such as third-party libraries — this can lead to a memory leak.\r\nWhen we use `async.then(updateLatestValue)`, the engine captures a reference to the `updateLatestValue` function. This allows the promise to invoke that function when it resolves. When we use `from(async)`, we're essentially inverting the dependency. In this case, `updateLatestValue` is passed as a callback to be invoked whenever the observable emits a value.\r\nThe internal `from` mechanism checks whether `subscriber.closed` is falsy before calling `subscriber.next()` when the promise resolves. Therefore, if the promise resolves after the strategy has been disposed of, nothing will happen.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58041","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(common): wrap promise in `from()` to prevent potential memory leaks\" (#58041)"},{"Id":"2560248357","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T21:30:17","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"58040","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): cleanup home event listeners when view is destroyed","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we're explicitly providing the `DestroyRef` of the home component to `HomeAnimation` because injecting the `DestroyRef` inside `HomeAnimation` would resolve to the environment injector, preventing the removal of event listeners once the user navigates away from the home page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58040","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs-infra): cleanup home event listeners when view is destroyed\" (#58040)"},{"Id":"2559931999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T18:50:55","Actor":"StankaKopalova","Number":"58037","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix incorrect title of section","State":"closed","Body":"- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nchanged wrong title of section in documentation\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58037","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix incorrect title of section\" (#58037)"},{"Id":"2559810919","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T17:27:29","Actor":"AnkitSharma-007","Number":"58036","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: The title of the section on the tutorial page does not match the content","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen navigating to this page: https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/11-details-page, I noticed that the title of the first section reads \"Create a new service for your app.\" However, the content of this section doesn't discuss creating a service.

One app is the Identity App and we need to run this and one of the other apps which provide features. I start up the Identity App first and then run the Feature App.\r\n\r\nEach time I run ng serve for the Identity App I get a folder in .angular\\cache\\18.2.5\\vite which is named deps_temp_#hash where the hash is different each time. If I run this with a completely empty cache folder every time I run ng serve I get another folder created.\r\n\r\nI then run ng serve for the Feature App and I get a similar folder but it quickly disappears and I get a deps folder but all of the temp folders for the Identity App remain.\r\n\r\nTypically on first run I now get an error in the Network tab of Chrome DevTools with 504 error always on a file called `browser-#hash.js?v=#hash`. Upon rerunning ng serve the problem can go away and sometimes it's very difficult to replicate again and then other times it happens all the time. The browser file is requested from disk from the vite cache and it never exists within the cache itself.\r\n\r\nObviously the app is rendered useless when it does happen.\r\n\r\nI understand without a repo that replicates this its going to be very difficult to diagnose however I was hoping that somebody with a little more knowledge than myself of this tooling process could provide some guidance as we have come to a full-stop on it other than disabling the cache or just living with the problem.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nUnfortunately I haven't as yet managed to replicate the problem in an example setup outside of our live application. The application uses Duende Identity server and ASP.NET Core minimal API projects along with multiple SQL databases etc. so its not an easy thing to replicate in its entirety.\n\n### Exception or

This allowed for custom control during SSR scenarios.\r\nHowever, as per the Angular documentation:\r\n\r\n> Note: In Angular v17 and later, server.ts is no longer used by ng serve. The dev server will use main.server.ts directly to perform server-side rendering.\r\n\r\nThis change has introduced a regression where it's no longer possible to pass these objects to the SSR process when using the development server.\r\n\r\nHere is the example our project used. \r\n\r\n### tokens.ts \r\n```\r\nconst CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<AppContext>('EXAMPLE_TOKEN');\r\n\r\nexport class BrowserContext extends AppContext { ... } \r\nexport class ExpressContext extends AppContext { ... } \r\n```\r\n\r\n### server.ts \r\n```\r\nimport { CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN } from './tokens';\r\nimport bootstrap from './src/main.server';\r\n\r\nfunction app() {\r\n     const server = express();\r\n     const engine = new CommonEngine();\r\n     ...\r\n     server.get('*', (req, res) => {\r\n        const expressContext = new ExpressContext(req, res);\r\n\r\n        engine.render({\r\n            bootstrap,\r\n            providers: [\r\n                 { provide: CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN, useValue: expressContext }\r\n            ],\r\n        });\r\n     });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using ng serve in Angular v17+, the Vite dev server only looks at main.server.ts. As a result, even if we inject providers into server.ts, there's no way to pass the request/response objects to the SSR process.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe should have a way to pass request/response objects to the SSR process when using the development server, similar to how it was possible in versions prior to Angular v17. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28535","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[dev-server] Unable to pass custom providers for SSR in Angular v17+\"

The new component uses a combination of an `input` and a dropdown to allow users to either type a time or select it from a pre-defined list. Example usage:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Pick a time</mat-label>\r\n  <input matInput [matTimepicker]=\"picker\"/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker #picker/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker-toggle [for]=\"picker\"/>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeatures of the new component include:\r\n* Automatically parses the typed-in value to a date object using the current `DateAdapter`. Existing date adapters have been updated to add support for parsing times.\r\n* Time values can be generated either using the `interval` input (e.g. `interval=\"45min\"`) or provided directly through the `options` input.\r\n* Integrated into `@angular/forms` by providing itself as a `ControlValueAccessor` and `Validator`.\r\n* Offers built-in validation for minimum, maximum and time formatting.\r\n* Offers keyboard navigation support.\r\n* Accessibility implemented using the combobox + listbox pattern.\r\n* Can be used either with `mat-form-field` or on its own.\r\n* Can be combined with `mat-datepicker` (docs to follow, see the dev app for now).\r\n* Includes test harnesses for all directives.\r\n* Works with Material's theming system.\r\n* Can be configured globally through an injection token.\r\n* Can be used either as an `NgModule` or by importing the standalone directives.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why did it take so long?\r\nOne of the main reasons why we hadn't provided a timepicker component until now was that there's no \r\nuniversally-accepted design for what a timepicker should look like.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn't Material Design have a timepicker?\r\nMaterial Design has had a [specification for a timepicker](https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview) for years, but we didn't want to implement it because:\r\n1. This design is primarily geared towards mobile users on Android. It would look out of place in the desktop-focused enterprise UIs that a lot of Angular developers build.\r\n2. The time dial UI is complicated and can be overwhelming, especially in the 24h variant.\r\n3. The accessibility pattern is unclear, users may have to fall back to using the inputs.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. The time dial requires very precise movements if the user wants to select a specific time between others (e.g. 6:52). This can be unusable for users with some disabilities.\r\n6. The non-dial functionality (inputs in a dropdown) don't add much to the user experience.\r\n\r\nThere are [community implementations](https://dhutaryan.github.io/ngx-mat-timepicker) of the dial design that you can install if you want it for your app.\r\n\r\n#### What are some alternate designs that you considered?\r\nSome libraries like [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/timepicker), [Ignite UI](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/time-picker) or [MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/), as well as Chrome's implementation of `<input type=\"time\"/>` appear to have settled on a multi-column design for the dropdown. We didn't want to do something similar because:\r\n1. The selected state is only shown using one sensory characteristic (color) which is problematic for accessibility. While we could either add a second one (e.g. a checkbox) or adjust the design somehow, we felt that this would make it look sub-optimal.\r\n2. The UI only looks good on smaller sizes and when each column has roughly the same amount of text. Changing either for a particular column can throw off the whole UI's appearance.\r\n3. It requires the user to tab through several controls within the dialog.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. Each column requires a lot of filler whitespace in order to be able to align the selected states to each other which can look off on some selections.\r\n\r\n#### Why this design?\r\nWe chose the current design, because:\r\n1. Users are familiar with it, e.g. Google Calendar uses something similar for their time selection.\r\n2. It reuses the design from existing Material Design components.\r\n3. It uses an established accessibility pattern (combobox + listbox) and it doesn't have the same concerns as the multi-column design around indicating the selected state.\r\n4. It allows us to support a wide range of locales.\r\n5. It's compact, allowing us to do some sort of unified control with `mat-datepicker` in the future.\r\n\r\nFixes #5648.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29806","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/timepicker): add timepicker component\" (#29806)"},{"Id":"2558306828","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T06:30:21","Actor":"marcingryczon","Number":"29805","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-menu): axe a11y report throws aria-expanded not allowed issue","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur axe a11y reports throws issue points to mat-menu aria-expanded as not allowed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 08 21 04\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdc66e0b-d726-4df3-9b80-4fe3a4cde112\">\r\n\r\nIs there any way to use this component without aria-expanded?

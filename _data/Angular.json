In reality, `detectChangesInternal` directly calls `refreshView` and refreshes a view directly without checking if it was dirty (to my discontent).\r\n\r\nThis update clears the refresh flags at the top of `refreshView` as well as before traversing child views in `Targeted` mode. The issue only partially exists with signals in that the flags aren't cleared but we don't end up refreshing the view a second time because the `consumerPollProducersForChange` returns `false` the second time we enter `detectChangesInView`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): Avoid refreshing a host view twice when using transplanted…\" (#53021)"},{"Id":"2000001866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-17T22:06:29","Actor":"stot3","Number":"53020","RawContent":null,"Title":"Page titles are not distinguishable ","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe home page, should let the user know where they are at via the title tag. \n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nangular.dev\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nAngular | Home\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nInspecting the Page title. \n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nYou should Append the location to the end of the title. \n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53020","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Page titles are not distinguishable \" (#53020)"},{"Id":"1999866583","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-17T21:58:21","Actor":"viniciusschuelter","Number":"53014","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support input string in styleUrls ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon, core\n\n### Description\n\nLike happen in styles property, would be great if can just pass a string of file path in styleUrls\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExactly like styles property string | string[] \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nProbably implement this like styles property is the best way, but if it not possible maybe include another property like 'styleUrl'","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53014","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support input string in styleUrls \" (#53014)"},{"Id":"1999946311","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-17T21:21:27","Actor":"dwilches","Number":"53019","RawContent":null,"Title":"Could not resolve require(\"./locale/**/*\")","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nAfter upgrading to the new esbuild build in Angular 17 with `esbuild-browser` I got this compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n⠏ Building...✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve require(\"./locale/**/*\")\r\n\r\n    node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js:528:28:\r\n      528 │       e = at._abbr, require(\"./locale/\" + t), ct(e);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way I have `moment.min.js` in my setup is:\r\n\r\nangular.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"build\": {\r\n  \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"scripts\": [\r\n      \"./node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js\",\r\n```\r\n\r\ntsconfig.app.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"./tsconfig.json\",\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"moment\": [\"./node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I look into the `node_modules/moment/min` folder, indeed there is no `locale` subfolder (although this was working before).

The application neither updates the UI nor throws any errors, and it requires a restart to reflect the changes. This issue is intermittent but significantly hampers the development process.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1. Run the application using `ng serve`.\r\n2. Make changes to a component or service.\r\n3. Save the file.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe application should automatically reflect the changes in the browser without needing to manually restart the server.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nSometimes, the application does not update the UI or show any error messages after saving changes. The only workaround is to stop and restart `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Angular version: 17.x.x\r\n- Browser: [e.g., Chrome, Firefox]\r\n- Operating System: [e.g., Windows, macOS]\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**:\r\nThis issue does not occur every time but is frequent enough to disrupt the normal workflow. I have not experienced this in previous versions of Angular. Any insights or solutions to this problem would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTaner Saydam\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

This removes the special handling previously used and better ensures that cache checks are valid. The separate babel cache Map has also been combined with the already present memory load cache within the Angular plugin. This removes the need for extra handling of another Map and allows it to use the common logic of the load cache. To support this usage, the load cache will also now automatically include the request path in the file dependencies if the request is from the `file` namespace. This removes the need to manually specify the request path file for each load result return value.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26385","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): use native path normalization for angular compiler caching\" (#26385)"},{"Id":"1997658502","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-17T11:57:58","Actor":"LanderBeeuwsaert","Number":"26383","RawContent":null,"Title":"The new vite dev server cannot handle URLs with a . in them","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nangular 16\n\n### Description\n\nIf you go to a URL with a . in it:\r\nhttp://localhost:4200/something.somethingelse\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1487\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/1098243/e082cfcf-d6fd-4d9e-996d-d3d5190b16d7\">\r\n\r\nwith the esbuild builder, this will not go to the dev server anymore.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\njust do an ng serve and go to an URL with a .\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.0.1\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                              Version\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect            0.1700.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular        17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core                 16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics           16.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                         16.2.12\r\n@angular/cli                         17.0.1\r\n@angular/fire                        16.0.0\r\n@angular/google-maps                 16.2.12\r\n@angular/material                    16.2.12\r\n@angular/material-date-fns-adapter   16.2.12\r\n@angular/youtube-player              16.2.12\r\n@bazel/typescript                    5.8.1\r\n@schematics/angular                  16.2.6\r\nrxjs                                 7.8.1\r\ntypescript                           5.2.2\r\nzone.js                              0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26383","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The new vite dev server cannot handle URLs with a . in them\" (#26383)"},{"Id":"1998748216","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-17T10:11:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26391","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(@angular-devkit/build-angular): only create one instance of postcss when needed","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nPrior to this change a postcss instance was created for every component style.

HTML element. \r\nI'm working on a modal component using the dialog element and its \"showModal()\" API to display it as a modal dialog.\r\nThe problem is that the Overlay is not \"promoted\" to the top layer and it remains hidden behind the dialog.\r\nI'm attaching a [Stackblitz reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html) of the issue.\r\n\r\nIn addiction, I tried also to implement a custom overlay to place the `cdk-overlay-container` close to the input instead of the default behaviour at the bottom of the body, but then the `cdk-overlay-panel` _left_ position seems to be computed in a wrong way, in the sense that the content box seems to be the dialog but the left position is computed considering the viewport as content box. I guess (just guessing) the second issue is something related to [this discussion](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8040) about the w3c dialog specification.\r\n\r\nI found the issues using both @angular/cdk versions 16 and 17. The Stackblitz uses the latest one for convenience.\r\n\r\nThank you, looking forward for some feedback on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  Click the button \"Open dialog\"\r\n2.  Click on the input \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay should appear below the input.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay is hidden behind the dialog.

There is a `:before` pseudo element which has an empty string as content, and I believe the purpose of this element is to set the height of the title element with the `mat-dialog-title` directive.  Is this correct?  This implementation seems very hacky to me and flexbox `justify-content` does not work property because this pseudo element is considered an element within a flex container, and therefore the developer either needs to create a new flex container within the `mat-dialog-title` or remove the content from the `:before` psuedo element.

I have just found this documentation: \r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components\r\n\r\nIn the next example, image I'm creating a custom carousel Angular component which has a theming scss file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel-button {\r\n    // Read the 500 hue from the primary color palette.\r\n    color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 500);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel {\r\n    // Get the headline font from the theme.\r\n    font: mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin theme($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, color) {\r\n    @include color($theme);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, typography) {\r\n    @include typography($theme);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n@use './path/to/carousel-theme' as carousel;\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n\r\n$my-primary: mat.define-palette(mat.$indigo-palette, 500);\r\n$my-accent: mat.define-palette(mat.$pink-palette, A200, A100, A400);\r\n\r\n$my-theme: mat.define-light-theme((\r\n color: (\r\n   primary: $my-primary,\r\n   accent: $my-accent,\r\n ),\r\n typography: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n    $font-family: serif,\r\n  );\r\n));\r\n\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);\r\n@include carousel.theme($my-theme);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach doesn't take into account Angular view encapsulation at component level since 'my-carousel' class styles are global after '@include' them in 'styles.scss' file. Therefore, if I use 'my-carousel' CSS class in some HTML element of my application, apart from 'carousel' Angular component, the theming is applied.\r\n\r\nCould you provide me with best practices to deal with this scenario?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, is it a good practice to use `mat-*` classes in component html?

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nInline event handlers are allowed in Angular templates as long as their\r\nvalues are constant. However, specifying such attributes currently leads\r\nto Trusted Types violations being generated, as Angular passes their\r\nconstant values as plain strings to setAttribute, which in this case is\r\na Trusted Types sink. This is made worse by a Chromium bug\r\n(https://crbug.com/993268) which treats any attribute starting with `on`\r\nas a Trusted Types sink, causing a Trusted Types violation when any\r\ncustom attribute starting with `on` is specified in an Angular template.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nFix this by promoting constant (and thus safe) values of inline event\r\nhandlers to TrustedScript before they are passed to the setAttribute\r\ncall. Note that all attributes that start with 'on' (e.g. 'onload' or\r\n'onerror') are promoted to a TrustedScript, even though they are not\r\nnecessarily an inline event handler (e.g. 'online' or 'one'). This is\r\nnot security sensitive and will essentially be a no-op as the values get\r\nstringified. This is done to work around the Chromium bug and minimize\r\ncode size impact, which would otherwise require listing all valid inline\r\nevent handler names in Angular's DOM schema.\r\n\r\nDevelopers interested in restricting usage of inline event handlers in\r\ntheir templates will still be able to do so by setting a Content\r\nSecurity Policy that does not include the 'unsafe-inline' directive.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45433","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): make inline event handlers compatible with Trusted Types\" (#45433)"},{"Id":"1179240500","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-24T21:32:08","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"45428","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency send to ^0.18.0","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [send](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send) | [`^0.17.1` -> `^0.18.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/send/0.17.2/0.18.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/compatibility-slim/0.17.2)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/send/0.18.0/confidence-slim/0.17.2)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pillarjs/send</summary>\n\n### [`v0.18.0`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send/blob/HEAD/HISTORY.md#&#8203;0180--2022-03-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/send/compare/0.17.2...0.18.0)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   Fix emitted 416 error missing headers property\n-   Limit the headers removed for 304 response\n-   deps: depd@2.0.0\n    -   Replace internal `eval` usage with `Function` constructor\n    -   Use instance methods on `process` to check for listeners\n-   deps: destroy@1.2.0\n-   deps: http-errors@2.0.0\n    -   deps: depd@2.0.0\n    -   deps: statuses@2.0.1\n-   deps: on-finished@2.4.1\n-   deps: statuses@2.0.1\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Something that has made it easier for me is to display the hash version in the settings menu of my applications, it provides a way to view \"version numbers\" of deployed service workers and then I can prepare a **safety-worker.js** for the correct version.\r\n\r\nSo when I get a user who reports to me they are having issues, I ask them to go to settings and send me the version number there. Before I started using this method it was a pain to explain to users that they must clear cache or unregister.\r\n\r\nLast I checked, the hash is only really emitted when update events are fired (and it is not type safe).\r\n\r\nI would like an easier/official way of accessing the service workers hash/version to make it easier to debug and identify what version of deployed service worker is giving issues in deployed apps.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA new method to get/expose the hash/version\r\n\r\ne.g. this.swUpdate.getHash() or this.swUpdate.getCurrentVersion();\r\n\r\nit would also be nice to perhaps have this.swUpdate.getPreviousHash();\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nContinue using a workaround for this value, perhaps add workaround to documentation.\r\n\r\nHere is code I have written\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n availableUpdate$: Observable<void> = this.swUpdate.available.pipe(\r\n    map((event: UpdateAvailableEvent) => {\r\n      const updateInfo = {\r\n        current_version: event.current.hash,\r\n        update_version: event.available.hash,\r\n      };\r\n\r\n     //  this.storage.set('pwaVersion', updateInfo.current_version).subscribe();\r\n\r\n      this.swUpdate.activateUpdate();\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  activatedUpdate$: Observable<void> = this.swUpdate.activated.pipe(\r\n    map((event: UpdateActivatedEvent) => {\r\n      const previousUpdate =\r\n        event.previous?.hash !== undefined ? event.previous.hash : 'none';\r\n\r\n      const successfulUpdateInfo = {\r\n        previous_version: previousUpdate,\r\n        current_version: event.current.hash,\r\n      };\r\n\r\n      // this.storage.set('pwaVersion', successfulUpdateInfo.current_version).subscribe();\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45414","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fetch current service worker version/hash\" (#45414)"},{"Id":"1177155224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-22T18:36:01","Actor":"elnipa","Number":"45413","RawContent":null,"Title":"Compile error related to nullish coalescing in template ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating one of my projects from v13.1.x to v.13.2.x or v13.3.x the project would not compile anymore with a very generic error message.\r\nNarrowing down the bug was thus very difficult.

As in above example none of the content is rendered on root path, not even in primary outlet.\r\n\r\nI tried to also swap the guard so the primary outlet shouldn't render and aside content should render as both are on same level only with different access.\r\nIt seems to me like the outlet parameter of the route is not taken into consideration when being piped through guards which is counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nThis behaves the same for \"component\" routes, parent routes as well as lazyloaded loadChildren type of route.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-jxiqid?file=src/app/app.component.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception is thrown, just content that should be rendered is not.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nNode 16\r\nReplicated this bug @13 and also ^14.0.0-next.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nCurrently I solved it by explicitly naming paths differently for primary and aux outlets and on bootstrap navigate to outlet's named root resulting in longer URL:\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n```HTML\r\nhttp://myapp.app/\r\n```\r\nI have to have AppComponent's ngOnInit:\r\n```JS\r\nrouter.navigate([{ outlets: { aside: ['editor'] }}]);\r\n```\r\nResulting in this:\r\n```HTML\r\nhttp://myapp.app/(aside:editor)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever except visual uncanniness of root url this comes with other drawbacks especially when navigating to root of primary outlet \"/\" it resets aux outlet, therefore everywhere I need to navigate to primary's root I explicitly need to navigate to aux's root as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45412","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Guards not outlet-aware\" (#45412)"},{"Id":"1176578646","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-22T12:07:12","Actor":"mrbenjoi","Number":"45409","RawContent":null,"Title":"CurrencyPipe use en-US locale by default instead of browser locale.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n- OS: KDE-Neon 20.04 (which is a Ubuntu LTS 20.04)\r\n- Browser: Firefox 98.0.1 (64-Bit)\r\n- Angular-CLI: 13.1.4\r\n- Node: 16.13.1\r\n- NPM: npm 8.5.3\r\n\r\n**Browser-Settings:**\r\n\r\n- `navigator.language` = `\"de-DE\"`\r\n- `(new Intl.NumberFormat()).resolvedOptions().locale` = `\"de-DE\"`\r\n- `(new Intl.DateTimeFormat()).resolvedOptions().locale` = `\"de-DE\"`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Observed Behavior:**\r\n\r\nUsing currency pipe `<div>{{ 12345.678 | currency }}</div>` produces `$12,345.67`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\nUsing currency pipe `<div>{{ 12345.678 | currency }}</div>` should produce either `$12.345,67` or `12.345,67 $` because the decimal separator in locale `\"de-DE\"` is `,`, not `.`, and the thousands-separator is `.`, not `,`.\r\n\r\nAfter debugging this I found out that, *in the case of no locale being configured explicitly anywhere in the project*, the currency pipe uses `\"en-US\"` as fallback locale to format numbers. The expected behavior is, that in the case of *no explicit locale configuration by the developer*, angular reads the corresponding locale (`NumberFormat` or `DateTimeFormat`) from the Intl-API to provide the user with a formatting that he wants to see, instead of the `\"en-US\"` one.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/2LRZswU8FoDV4mqt?open=lib%2Fapp.ts&deferRun=1&preview\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.1.4\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.4\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.4\r\n@angular/material               13.2.3\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45409","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CurrencyPipe use en-US locale by default instead of browser locale.\" (#45409)"},{"Id":"1175723083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-21T23:56:13","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"45406","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: replace `defaultCollection` with `schematicCollections`","State":"closed","Body":"`defaultCollection` has deprecated in favor of `schematicCollections`.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22860\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45406","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: replace `defaultCollection` with `schematicCollections`\" (#45406)"},{"Id":"1175907197","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-21T23:55:41","Actor":"devversion","Number":"45407","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to bazel v5 for new runfiles API used in dev-infra","State":"closed","Body":"https://blog.bazel.build/2022/01/19/bazel-5.0.html#starlark-build-language","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45407","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to bazel v5 for new runfiles API used in dev-infra\" (#45407)"},{"Id":"1175463921","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-21T14:23:54","Actor":"devversion","Number":"45405","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(bazel): speed up dev-turnaround by bundling types only when packaging","State":"open","Body":"Speeds up the dev-turnaround by only bundling types when packaging.

This works well but there are cases when running simple `npm install` is not enough. For example, last version of NPM might throw \"Unable to resolve dependency tree\" error. This can be easily fixed with an `--legacy-peer-deps` option. Unfortunately, this option is not available for `NodePackageInstallTask`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd ability to provide `legacyPeerDeps` option to `NodePackageInstallTask`. Even better solution would be to add opportunity to provide any custom options to `NodePackageInstallTask`. They should be passed down to command line automatically.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've tried to write my own `NodePackageInstallTask` with an extra option. But this didn't work. I've discovered that provided options are just meta-data for the executor (https://github.dev/angular/angular-cli/blob/366cabc66c3dd836e2fdfea8dad6c4c7c2096b1d/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/package-manager/executor.ts#L112). From executor code it is clear that there is a predefined set of options for NPM task and there is no way to override or extend this.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add legacyPeerDeps option to NodePackageInstallTask\" (#22886)"},{"Id":"1178182968","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-23T14:14:24","Actor":"Oznaprazzi","Number":"22885","RawContent":null,"Title":"Absolute paths broken in Angular 12+ for templateUrl and styleUrls","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am using Angular 13, upgraded from Angular 11 but after upgrading to Angular 12, the absolute paths stopped working for templateUrl and styleUrls.\r\n\r\nWhen I was with Angular 11, I had the AOT complier on and it was working.\r\n\r\nI'm needing to use absolute paths because I want to avoid having long relative paths and a lot of my components are using shared ```.scss``` and ```.html``` files for showing delete/restore confirm dialogs etc.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what I currently have in the components for templateUrl and styleUrls which is not working in Angular 12+ but still working in Angular 11.\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['/src/app/directory/directory/example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nIf I change the above to use relative path like below then it works but it doesn't look nice to have so many ```../../../```\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'something',\r\n    templateUrl: '../../../../example.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['../../../../example.component.scss']\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis is the templateUrl error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: path/to/directory/something.component.ts:9:18 - error NG2008: Could not find template file 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html'.\r\n\r\ntemplateUrl: 'path/to/another/directory/example.component.html',\r\n```\r\nThis is the styleUrls error I'm getting:\r\n```\r\nError: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss?ngResource' in 'C:\\Users\\...\\frontend'\r\n\r\nError: The loader \"C:/Users/.../path/to/directory/path/to/another/directory/example.component.scss\" didn't return a string.\r\n```\r\nI've also tried adding paths like below to my tsconfig but it doesn't affect anything.\r\n```\r\n \"paths\": {\r\n      \"@env\": [\r\n        \"environments/environment\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@shared/*\": [\r\n        \"app/shared/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"@core/*\": [\r\n        \"app/core/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"~*\": [\r\n        \"src/*\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI've seen answers suggesting to use raw-loader but I'm not quite sure how it works and if that's even the right solution here.

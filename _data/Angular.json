This enhancement improves application performance by preventing redundant failed requests during server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration.\r\n\r\n## Motivation / Use Cases\r\n\r\nThe `includeFailedResponses` option is particularly useful for:\r\n\r\n**Error Response Consistency**: When the same API endpoint fails on the server during SSR, caching the error prevents duplicate failed requests on the client, ensuring consistent error handling across both environments.\r\n\r\n**Performance Optimization**: Reduces unnecessary network calls for endpoints that are expected to fail (e.g., checking user permissions, feature availability checks), improving application load times.\r\n\r\n**Development & Testing**: Helps maintain predictable behavior in development environments where certain API endpoints might be intentionally unavailable or return errors.\r\n\r\n**Graceful Degradation**: Enables applications to handle predictable failures more efficiently, particularly useful for optional features that may not be available in certain environments.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n1. **Enhanced Interface**: Added `cacheFailedResponses?: boolean` to `HttpTransferCacheOptions`\r\n2. **Error Detection**: Implemented HTTP status code validation to identify failed responses (status codes outside 200-299 range)\r\n3. **Selective Caching**: Error responses are only cached when explicitly enabled via the `cacheFailedResponses` option\r\n4. **Transfer State Integration**: Failed responses are stored in the same transfer state mechanism as successful responses\r\n5. **Client-side Replay**: Cached error responses are properly recreated as `HttpErrorResponse` objects on the client\r\n6. **Full Backward Compatibility**: The feature is opt-in and doesn't affect existing behavior\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport type HttpTransferCacheOptions = {\r\n  includeHeaders?: string[];\r\n  filter?: (req: HttpRequest<unknown>) => boolean;\r\n  includePostRequests?: boolean;\r\n  includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders?: boolean;\r\n  includeFailedResponses?: boolean; // New option\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```typescript\r\n// Enable error caching globally\r\nproviders: [\r\n     provideClientHydration(\r\n      withHttpTransferCacheOptions({ includeFailedResponses: false })\r\n    ),\r\n]\r\n```\r\nRelative : https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57185","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63496","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(http): Adds option to cache failed HTTP responses\" (#63496)"},{"Id":"3368320121","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T22:12:16","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"63495","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add more team members as approvers","State":"closed","Body":"adds amishne, leonsenft, mattrbeck to approve but not receive review requests\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63495","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: add more team members as approvers\" (#63495)"},{"Id":"3367850924","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T21:06:37","Actor":"akib1997","Number":"63492","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): properties should be readonly","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Almost every time I use a resource I end up writing some version of this computed signal:\n```ts\nreadonly fooValue = computed(() => {\n  if (this.fooResource.hasValue()) {\n    return this.fooResource.value();\n  } else if (this.fooResource.error()) {\n    return this.fooResource.error();\n  } else if (this.fooResource.isLoading()) {\n    return \"Loading...\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe idea is simple, but the implementation seems thorny. As a baseline, I'm considering that it would be convenient to call a resource directly, with something like the following behavior:\n```ts\nreadonly myResource = resource({\n  loader: (): Promise<MyType> => ...\n});\n\n// calling myResource() directly would be equivalent to calling this computed signal:\nreadonly myValue = computed<MyType | Error | undefined>(() => {\n  if (this.myResource.hasValue()) {\n    return this.myResource.value();\n  } else if (this.myResource.error()) {\n    return error();\n  }\n  return undefined;\n});\n```\n\nIt seems clear that there's not a one-size fits all solution to this, so perhaps this merits an additional configuration point on the resource? Something like:\n```ts\nreadonly myResource = resource({\n  loader: (): Promise<MyType> => ...\n  transform: (response: {value?: MyType, status: ResourceStatus, error?: Error, isLoading: boolean}) => {\n    if (response.error) {\n      return \"Something went wrong!\";\n    } else if (response.isLoading) {\n      return \"Loading...\";\n    } else {\n      return response.value;\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've been torn about writing a wrapper, and haven't decided to go that direction yet because I don't really want to diverge from the angular primitives.

URI to render its dotted buffer animation via a background-image style. This is a change from Angular Material v14, where the SVG was injected directly into the DOM.\nWhile the SVG itself is static and safe, this implementation forces developers who use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to either:\n1. Enable img-src data:, which is widely considered a security risk as it opens a potential vector for XSS attacks.\n2. Whitelist the specific hash of the SVG content. (if this is doable, I personally didn't succeed)\n\nI tried to generate a sha256 from the SVG based on what is output in the Google Chrome console : \n```\nRefused to load the image 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'%3E%3Ccircle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/%3E%3C/svg%3E' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=' https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googletagmanager.com\".\n```\n`w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=` is the sha256 I get with this script :\n``` bash\necho -n \"<svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'><circle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/></svg>\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64\n```\nMy CSP image source looks like to `img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g='` and the error is still raising.\nDebuging this is very time-consuming.\n\nThis is a significant regression from the v14 behavior, which was CSP-friendly out-of-the-box.\n\nProposed Solution / Suggestion:\n1. Please consider reverting to the previous implementation of injecting the SVG directly into the DOM.\n2. Providing the sha256 or a way to determine it.\n2. Providing an alternative mechanism that does not rely on data: URIs for styling. \n\nThis would greatly simplify CSP implementation for security-conscious applications. Thank you!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create an Angular application with a strict Content Security Policy that does not include img-src data:. For example: img-src 'self';.\n2. Use the <mat-progress-bar mode=\"buffer\"></mat-progress-bar> component.\n3. Observe the browser console for CSP errors related to a blocked data: URI.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe mat-progress-bar component should render without violating a strict CSP that disallows data: URIs for images. The v14 approach of injecting an inline element into the DOM was ideal, as it did not require any changes to img-src.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe component attempts to load a background-image with a data: URI, violating the CSP and preventing the buffer animation from rendering.\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1.7\n- CDK/Material: 20.1.6\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): TuxedoOS (Ubuntu 24.04 based) and Windows 10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31808","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-progress-bar): Use of `data:` URI for buffer SVG is a regression that complicates strict CSP implementation\" (#31808)"},{"Id":"3368834055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-30T07:03:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31807","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: generate more believable token examples","State":"open","Body":"Currently we generate the token examples by taking the first two tokens and using a static value for them.

This causes the two distinct `02:00` times (DST vs standard) on the fallback day to collapse into one — selecting the non-DST `02:00` ends up mapped to the DST `02:00`.\n\n### Custom DateAdapter:\nTo ensure consistent Luxon `DateTime` handling, I replaced the default `LuxonDateAdapter` with a custom one.\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomDateAdapter extends LuxonDateAdapter {\n  protected override locale = DateTimeService.LOCALE;\n\n  constructor() {\n    super(DATE_FORMATS);\n  }\n\n  /** Ensure datepicker provides Luxon DateTimes in the default zone */\n  public override createDate(year: number, month: number, date: number): DateTime {\n    return super.createDate(year, month, date)\n      .setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE)\n      .setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Needed so the timepicker does not treat DST and non-DST versions of the same wall time as equal.\n   * Without this, both values are considered the same and the DST one always “wins”.\n   */\n  public override sameTime(first: DateTime | null, second: DateTime | null): boolean {\n    if (!isDefined(first) || !isDefined(second)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    return +first === +second;\n  }\n\n  public override clone(date: DateTime): DateTime {\n    let cloned = super.clone(date);\n    cloned = cloned.setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE);\n    cloned = cloned.setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n    return cloned;\n  }\n}\n´´´\n\nDespite these adjustments, the underlying `_assignUserSelection` logic in the timepicker still collapses the two 02:00 times into one, because of how it uses the last valid date + setTime.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fyaws5vk\nSteps to reproduce:\n* Use the custom CustomDateAdapter (above) instead of the default LuxonDateAdapter.\nOn the DST end day ( 2025-10-26), try selecting both 02:00 (DST) and 02:00 (STD).\n* Observe that selecting the 02:00 (STD) still results in the 02:00 (DST) value being applied (or both depending on Custom vs LuxonDateAdapter).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* The timepicker should treat 02:00 DST and 02:00 STD as distinct values when using a fixed timezone.\n* Selecting the standard-time 02:00 should not be coerced into the DST-time 02:00.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* Because `_assignUserSelection` rebuilds the target date and applies extracted hours, the ambiguous hour is resolved to the earlier offset (DST).\n* Even with a custom adapter that distinguishes times (`sameTime` override), the timepicker ends up normalizing both selections to the DST instance.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome, ...\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n\n- Custom DateAdapter: subclass of LuxonDateAdapter (see above)\n- Timezone: Europe/Vienna\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(timepicker): Timepicker DST edge case: incorrect hour mapping with fixed timezone + custom Luxon adapter\" (#31803)"},{"Id":"3364051758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T17:01:37","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31802","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group","State":"open","Body":"WIP: fixing tests\r\n\r\n--\r\nThis change makes composite patterns work in a natural data-down flow with no more circular dependencies.\r\n\r\nProblems with current implementation\r\n- Toolbar and Radio Group are strongly coupled, each patterns contain complex conditional logics when each other pattern exists to handle event listener conflicts.\r\n- This also creates circular dependencies, and there are many `...Like` interfaces created as a workaround.\r\n- Not future proof. The above two problems will grow exponentially if a pattern needs to support multiple composite patterns.\r\n\r\nWith this refactoring\r\n- Event handlers are pulled out from patterns, and instead patterns provide actions of what they are capable to do.\r\n- Radio Group supports two sets of actions - as regular radio group and as a sub group in a toolbar.\r\n- Toolbar supports a new child pattern - Widget Group, which will treat everything inside as a blackbox. What it does is passing down the interactions from Toolbar, and whatever in the blackbox should handle those interactions.\r\n- Now the control-flow becomes clear\r\n  - On the top level, Toolbar-Interaction converts keyboard/pointer events into available Toolbar actions\r\n  - Widget and Widget Groups are both list items. If the current `activeItem` is a Widget Group, then keep passing down the Toolbar action.\r\n  - Whatever inside the Widget Group(in this case it's Radio Group) takes the instructions from Widget Group and handle the interactions by themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a result\r\n- This solves event handler conflicts in a composite pattern as patterns no longer need to bind their event handlers to a DOM.\r\n- Composite pattern parent no longer need to know what children patterns they are controlling. They only need to pass down instructions, and children patterns should implement their interop layer to handle those instructions, and return necessary information to the parent. Very typical Data Down Action Up style.\r\n- This approach also enables the potential of supporting non-Angular Aria library components, for example, as long as Material Radio Group can act on instructions sent from Widget Group, then it can be used within the Angular Aria Toolbar, without having to tweak anything inside the Toolbar. It can't be done with the current implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31802","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group\" (#31802)"},{"Id":"3362104721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T07:20:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31798","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: define typescript version via string in module.bazel file","State":"closed","Body":"Within our module.bazel file when describing the version of typescript to use for rules_ts, we use ts_version instead of ts_version_from to prevent our package.json file from being part of the set of files used to calculate the sha for the lock file.

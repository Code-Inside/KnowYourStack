In particular, API docs warn about methods that could be used in an insecure manner. (Big thank you to the community!)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `Renderer2` API docs do not say much about security. In particular, nothing regarding XSS. However, the [ElementRef](https://angular.io/api/core/ElementRef#properties) API docs state the following:\r\n\r\n> Alternatively you can take a look at [Renderer2](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2) which provides API that can safely be used even when direct access to native elements is not supported.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be helpful to mention this in the Renderer2 API docs? So that potential users know what to expect...\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\n1. Read `Renderer2` API docs\r\n2. Read `ElementRef` API docs \n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\nI would _expect_ the the `Renderer2` API docs to document security implications. Specifically regarding XSS. `ElementRef` docs say that `Renderer2` \"provides API that can safely be used\".\r\nIf this is true (and superficial testing seems to support it) I'd _expect_ that the `Renderer2` API docs mention it explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf there are any exceptions to this general rule, I'd _expect_ the `Renderer2` API docs would show a clear \"USE WITH CAUTION\" security warning. E.g. if the following method calls lead to XSS, I'd _expect_ a warning in the API docs:\r\n```\r\nrenderer2.setAttribute(a, 'href', 'javascript:alert(1)');\r\nrenderer2.setAttribute(svg, 'onload', 'alert(1)');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the claims that `ElementRef` docs make about `Renderer2` are inaccurate or misleading, I'd _expect_ them to be adjusted or removed.\r\n\r\nThe _actual_ situation is that `Renderer2` API docs do not tell me anything about security. And I feel a little lost.\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\nShould be trivial to reproduce without screenshots, but I can provide some on demand...\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNone.\n```\n\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue? If so, please specify the device, browser, and version.\n\n```true\nNot browser-specific imho.\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46904","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Render2 lacks security documentation\" (#46904)"},{"Id":"1310249143","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-20T15:50:49","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"46898","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(bazel): remove `experimental_extended_template_diagnostics` flag","State":"closed","Body":"Extended diagnostics are enabled by default now and this flag doesn't do anything anymore but I missed it in a previous cleanup.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n`experimental_extended_template_diagnostics` flag exists, but is a no-op because they are enabled by default.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n`experimental_extended_template_diagnostics` flag is removed.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\nThe flag was always experimental and not public API.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46898","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(bazel): remove `experimental_extended_template_diagnostics` flag\" (#46898)"},{"Id":"1310069010","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-20T15:49:19","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46896","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): `NgModuleRef` should not implement `EnvironmentInjector` interface","State":"closed","Body":"This commit refactors the `NgModuleRef` implementation to drop functions required by the `EnvironmentInjector` interface.

As a component author I expect and require the consumer to use `slotA` and `slotB`.  If they need to loop over some grouping of content the correct pattern would be to use an `ng-container` with `*ngFor`.   Currently this will break because `ng-content` with the `select` will see `ng-container` as the root element not elements `slotA` or `slotB`.  `ngProjectAs` is often suggested as the solution for cases like this but doesn’t work in this situation.\r\n\r\nThe `ngProjectAs` has to go on the `ng-container` and forces the child elements to be slotted in to only 1 of the 2 slots (depending on what `ngProjectAs` is set to).  \r\n\r\n\u2028\u2028A consumer would have to do a `*ngFor` on each element in the grouping but this is against the pattern of what Angular teaches and is the exact purpose that `ng-container` fulfills. \u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nAn example showing that this doesn’t work as expected in this scenario:\r\n\u2028\u2028https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-qt2q5f?file=src/app/app.component.html\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nSome way for a component author to flatten/allow/disregard `ng-containers`.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways that this could come about:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Option on `ng-content` that allows the author to disregard `ng-containers` for that content slot\r\n2. \u2028\u2028Expand the `select` CSS to allow something that describes this situation such as: \r\n\r\n\t1.  `select=“ng-container slotA, slotA”`\r\n\r\n\t2. `select=“::ng-deep slotA”`\r\n\r\nBoth of these proposed solutions would be non-breaking and would allow component authors to opt-in to allowing this functionality. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWe tried figuring out another alternatives but besides duplicating the `*ngFor` on every child element so that an `ng-container` isn’t needed there doesn’t appear to be any great alternatives.

As part of the 14.0 update, these individual component-level files were removed.  Instead, the top level `package.json` exposes path resolutions for each version of each component via a series of `exports` entries.  As a result, any consumer that does not understand or respect the `exports` field in the top level `package.json` becomes incompatible with this library.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nClone [this repro](https://github.com/thw0rted/issue-examples/tree/angular-webpack-material) and execute `npm run start`.

You will see:\r\n\r\n> ERROR in ./src/app/app.module.ts 29:17-52\r\n> Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n> resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n\r\nNote that the Webpack config uses `resolve.exportsFields: []` to ignore the `exports` field.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that do not understand the `exports` field should still be able to use the library.\r\n\r\n(If the files are not restored, and `exports`-field support is required going forward, this is a breaking change and should be documented as such in the change log, dating back to 14.0.0.)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that don't understand, or intentionally ignore, the `exports` field can no longer use the library.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the `exports` field is the recommended solution suggested by Webpack, when using a library that fails to explicitly export a resource you need to consume.  I am stuck with such a library, I've had an open issue with them to fix it for over a year and I'm not happy about it, but there is literally nothing else I can do.  Still, this is the first time I've run into a library that does not work at all when the `exports` field is ignored / unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.0.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.5\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Win10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(package): Unannounced breaking change: new package structure requires `exports` field support\" (#25305)"},{"Id":"1309192766","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T14:10:04","Actor":"alkavats1","Number":"25304","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet ","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25304","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet \" (#25304)"},{"Id":"1309099809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T10:17:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25301","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events","State":"closed","Body":"Adds checks to ensure that `touchmove` and `touchend` events are cancelable before we call `preventDefault` on them.\r\n\r\nFixes #25272.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25301","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events\" (#25301)"},{"Id":"1309148659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T08:25:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25303","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots","State":"closed","Body":"The snapshots were failing, because the MDC migration tests were targeting es2016, but the CLI introduced some es2020 syntax.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25303","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots\" (#25303)"},{"Id":"1309106031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T07:47:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25302","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/snack-bar): fix out-of-sync code","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes some code that is out of sync with the code we have internally.

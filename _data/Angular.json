To deal with this, instead we have to create a signal, then a subscription to the Observable that updates the signal, then teardown that subscription on component destruction. That's some plumbing that can be hidden and reused instead.\n\nAn example of such an application is a component that uses `contentChild` to get a content component and subscribe to an Observable on that child, which happens after construction.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new Signal type that has an `observe` function on it that accepts an Observable and that automatically subscribes and tears down the subscription when the signal is destroyed.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManual Observable subscribe,  signal update, unsubscribe.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Rxjs adapter signal that can be late-subscribed\" (#58055)"},{"Id":"2562185809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T16:54:09","Actor":"aYorky","Number":"58053","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reference doc api links may not navigate to the correct documentation in the sidebar.","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen looking at the reference documentation, clicking on a property or function in the api may not pull up the corresponding documentation in the sidebar. I've noticed this on several pages, though most recently on the FormGroup page. Likewise, clicking on one of the sidebar cards does not always highlight the correct item in the api. The offset seems to be fairly consistent per problematic page, though not all pages may have the same offset (i.e. clicking a property may pull up a doc for an item two down instead. This +2 offset will stay the same on that page, but another page may have a +1 offset). This may be related to properties that are not supposed to be publicly exposed (such as those starting with theta on the FormGroup page, which do not appear in the sidebar cards), but I can't say this definitively.\n\nIt seems that when a property is clicked and the card is brought up, the route registered in the browser correctly corresponds with the revealed card, but not with the actual property click. For example, if I click `readonly override valueChanges: Observable<TValue>;`, the route registered in the browser is instead `https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup#setValidators`, and indeed, the setValidators card appears.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No

Applications logs this specific events:\r\nFoo component creation, Foo component destruction, Every call to `shouldReuseRoute` with returned value.\r\n\r\nIn some cases router destroys FooComponent despite shouldReuseRoute returns true and in never recreates them back.\r\nTo replicate this specific error please launch attached application from repository and navigate to http://localhost:4200/Foo. \r\n\r\nWhen you start your application this way and navigate through the /Foo router subtree everything is working as expected, route is reused there is only one Foo Created in console.\r\nWhen you navigate to Abc route Foo is destroyed since it is not supposed to be reused which is expected at this time.\r\nAfter navigating to Abc when you navigate back to Foo/Bar/Baz component is recreated which is expected.\r\nThen if you navigate to /Foo the problem manifests.\r\nAngular calls RouteReuseStrategy to check if it should reuse route, strategy returns true. **Despite that** angular destroys FooComponent and never creates new instance of FooComponent.\r\n\r\nSo the replication goes like that:\r\n1. Start the app, run browser on http://localhost:4200/Foo\r\n2. Navigate to Abc route through link\r\n3. Navigate to either Bar or Bar/Baz links through link\r\n4. Navigate to Root link by url\r\n\r\nCuriously when you skip point 3. app works normally.\r\nWhen you start the app from url http://localhost:4200/Abc and go through the steps 3 - 4 it can be reproduced also.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is connected to this issue or I should issue another ticket, but there seems to be a problem with `activatedRoute.data` emissions in attached project.\r\n`FooComponent` is displaying activatedRoute.data in its body. \r\n\r\nIf you start the application from url `http://localhost:4200/Foo/Bar/Baz` it shows `{ \"path\": \"/Foo/Bar/Baz\" }` but if you start the app form url `http://localhost:4200/Foo` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/Foo/Bar/Baz` by link it shows `{ \"path\": \"/Foo/Bar - root\" }`. It is inconsistent and seems buggy. I am not sure if it supposed to work that way.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/MateuszBogdan/angular-router-bug\n\n### Please provide the

As you know those libraries are native in nodejs build in and does not support browser environment, so there we have to use polyfills for them like `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify`. With `webpack` we could create paths in the `tsconfig` file and everything worked great.\n\nUnfortunately this is not working well for esbuild and there are already a few related bug which where just solved in part, also one from my side [#26901](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901)\n\nThe solution proposed here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901#issuecomment-1907045285 by @clydin worked great for production build but it didnt work for dev server as I and also `xkx-dev` pointed out here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901#issuecomment-1913624658\n\n\nI have created an plain angular project with the real minimum requirements to run into a similar issue, which means the `stream` is not available on dev server.\nBut If I run exactly the same code as production build, everything is fine. So it looks like dev server ignores somehow libs/paths declared in the browser field of the package.json file\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere the repository\nhttps://github.com/mburger81/angular-crypto-esbuild\n\nthis is my browser field\n ```\n\"browser\": {\n    \"crypto\": \"crypto-browserify\",\n    \"stream\": \"stream-browserify\",\n    \"os\": \"os-browserify\",\n    \"https\": \"https-browserify\",\n    \"http\": \"stream-http\",\n    \"url\": \"url\"\n  }\n```\n\nAnd in the app.component.ts file I run a very simple example\n\n```\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\nimport * as crypto from 'crypto';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone:

 constructor() {\n    this.key = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('token').digest();\n    console.log('Key:', this.key);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\nvar Transform =

which this bug was not present was\n\nv17\n\n### Description\n\nHi.\nAfter upgrading from v17 to v19 and enabling `\"outputMode\": \"server\"` option, i constantly receive this error:\n\n```\nError: It looks like your application or one of its dependencies is using i18n.\nAngular 9 introduced a global `$localize()` function that needs to be loaded.\nPlease run `ng add @angular/localize` from the Angular CLI.\n(For non-CLI projects, add `import '@angular/localize/init';` to your `polyfills.ts` file.\nFor server-side rendering applications add the import to your `main.server.ts` file.)\n```\n\nMy polyfills are:\n\n`\"polyfills\": [\"@angular/localize/init\"],`\n\nDisabling `\"outputMode\": \"server\"` helps, also i found a solution to start the server with this option too:\n\n1) Comment all $localize fn usages and all routes\n2) Start dev server\n3) Uncomment all $localize fn usages & routes\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCan't reproduce it yet on clean application, but will update when i manage to.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nSince i am on nx, i can only give package.json

The new component uses a combination of an `input` and a dropdown to allow users to either type a time or select it from a pre-defined list.

Existing date adapters have been updated to add support for parsing times.\r\n* Time values can be generated either using the `interval` input (e.g. `interval=\"45min\"`) or provided directly through the `options` input.\r\n* Integrated into `@angular/forms` by providing itself as a `ControlValueAccessor` and `Validator`.\r\n* Offers built-in validation for minimum, maximum and time formatting.\r\n* Offers keyboard navigation support.\r\n* Accessibility implemented using the combobox + listbox pattern.\r\n* Can be used either with `mat-form-field` or on its own.\r\n* Can be combined with `mat-datepicker` (docs to follow, see the dev app for now).\r\n* Includes test harnesses for all directives.\r\n* Works with Material's theming system.\r\n* Can be configured globally through an injection token.\r\n* Can be used either as an `NgModule` or by importing the standalone directives.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why did it take so long?\r\nOne of the main reasons why we hadn't provided a timepicker component until now was that there's no \r\nuniversally-accepted design for what a timepicker should look like.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn't Material Design have a timepicker?\r\nMaterial Design has had a [specification for a timepicker](https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview) for years, but we didn't want to implement it because:\r\n1. This design is primarily geared towards mobile users on Android. It would look out of place in the desktop-focused enterprise UIs that a lot of Angular developers build.\r\n2. The time dial UI is complicated and can be overwhelming, especially in the 24h variant.\r\n3. The accessibility pattern is unclear, users may have to fall back to using the inputs.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. The time dial requires very precise movements if the user wants to select a specific time between others (e.g. 6:52). This can be unusable for users with some disabilities.\r\n6. The non-dial functionality (inputs in a dropdown) don't add much to the user experience.\r\n\r\nThere are [community implementations](https://dhutaryan.github.io/ngx-mat-timepicker) of the dial design that you can install if you want it for your app.\r\n\r\n#### What are some alternate designs that you considered?\r\nSome libraries like [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/timepicker), [Ignite UI](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/time-picker) or [MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/), as well as Chrome's implementation of `<input type=\"time\"/>` appear to have settled on a multi-column design for the dropdown. We didn't want to do something similar because:\r\n1. The selected state is only shown using one sensory characteristic (color) which is problematic for accessibility. While we could either add a second one (e.g. a checkbox) or adjust the design somehow, we felt that this would make it look sub-optimal.\r\n2. The UI only looks good on smaller sizes and when each column has roughly the same amount of text. Changing either for a particular column can throw off the whole UI's appearance.\r\n3. It requires the user to tab through several controls within the dialog.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. Each column requires a lot of filler whitespace in order to be able to align the selected states to each other which can look off on some selections.\r\n\r\n#### Why this design?\r\nWe chose the current design, because:\r\n1. Users are familiar with it, e.g. Google Calendar uses something similar for their time selection.\r\n2. It reuses the design from existing Material Design components.\r\n3.

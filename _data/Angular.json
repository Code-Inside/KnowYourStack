If ngOnDestroy is called like this:\r\n`ngOnDestroy = () => [some code]`\r\nThen it is not called.\r\n\r\nNote that the Typescript linter is actually okay with either style, even though the interface uses:\r\n`ngOnDestroy(): void`\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, you would assume that an arrow style function can be used for a lifecycle hook without actually trying it. The issue would be undetectable until you notice that the hook isn't working.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/whynoarrowstyle\r\nTwo components meet in the woods, one using an arrow style function, and one not using that function type. Click 'Destroy the below'. Notice that the code written in ngOnDestroy is called for the funcStyleComponent, but not the arrowStyleComponent.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNo error, more just looking for an explanation of the existing behavior, and whether more can be done to make it clear that using arrow style functions as lifecycle hooks will be invisibly undetectable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___ \r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.7\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.7\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.7\r\n@angular/fire                     6.0.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nngOnDestroy is often used to unsubscribe, and its code can often be reduced to one line.

When it's already right there in the browser (now ignoring that angular.io neither uses ssr, nor works without javascript - but our page does).\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to have was something like a `static` directive:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n<footer *static></footer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this is what the framework could do:\r\n\r\n* the server\r\n  * flag all styles that are created inside `<footer *static>...</footer>` for reuse in the browser\r\n* the compiler\r\n  * throw an error if you do anything dynamic inside - like adding an event listener\r\n  * create a dynamic component of the insides and put that into a seperate chunk, that is only loaded, when ssr is missing.

But it would be so much nicer, if the framework would handle that\r\n* the browser\r\n  * pick the ssr styles\r\n  * pick the ssr DOM\r\n  * if ssr is missing, load the contents async and render it\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI mean, if you use ssr, you already optimize the page to work without javascript.

It was fine with Angular 7 and 8. This is happening since updating to Angular 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGetting: Cannot access 'someService' before initialization error when I the updated library.\r\n\r\nI went and checked the build file and I am able to get it running with no issue when I moved the service anywhere before the module that is injected to.\r\n\r\nI moved around the order of the services since it was only affecting the providers.

Schematics\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen authoring an Angular CLI schematics, there are some very common things that will be implemented by almost every schematic new as there are no common public functions available.\r\nA quick [search on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=schematic%20utils) leads to many community project results.\r\nHowever as the Angular CLI itself uses the schematics and common utils, which are already tested and well defined, they should be available for the public.\r\n\r\nFor example the package [`@ockilson/schematic-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ockilson/schematics-utils#dependencies) implements the same (or almost the same) functions as already available in the [Angular CLI repo](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility/dependencies.ts)\r\n\r\nTo prevent some common pitfalls such functions and code duplications such common functions should be exported by `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nExport all functions from [packages/schematics/angular/utility](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility) to be available for other schematics.\r\nI think they should be exported via `@angular-devkit/schematics` or as `@angular-devkit/schematics/utils`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18250","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Export Schematics util

Make `--config debug` take precedence over `--config remote`.\r\n    * I'm not sure exactly how this could work, but I guess any flags in `--config debug` would be **probably** win over `--config remote`, since the former is a command line flag while the later is from a `.bazelrc` file?\r\n2. Warn or error when these two flags are used together.\r\n    * Even less sure if this is possible. No idea exactly how that would work.\r\n\r\nHopefully there's some way we can catch this particular error without just having tests hang forever.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38187","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`--config remote` and `--config debug` are incompatible\" (#38187)"},{"Id":"664035288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T20:38:56","Actor":"saifabusaleh","Number":"38186","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): correctly display copy button in IE11","State":"open","Body":"Fix button top portion was clipped in IE11 by setting overflow to visible\r\n\r\nFixes #37816\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is mainly for convenience, since type constructors were always called with the inputs present anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable for two reasons:\r\n1) Type constructors are expensive, and often unnecessary. They only need to be called if the directive or component is actually generic, and only need those inputs passed which reference the generic type parameters.\r\n\r\n2) For language service use cases, it is valuable to have a direct assignment operation for inputs in the TCB in order to extract LS information (e.g. `ts.TypeChecker.getSymbolAtLocation`).\r\n\r\nThus, we should refactor the way input checking works:\r\n* only call type constructors when necessary, and only with those inputs that affect generic type inference\r\n* always emit assignment operations for inputs\r\n* for diagnostics, rely on the type ctor call for generic inputs, and on the assignment operations for non-generic inputs (adding the ignore flag to the others)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38185","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy LS: refactor type constructors and input binding checking\" (#38185)"},{"Id":"663929143","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T17:28:29","Actor":"fxck","Number":"38184","RawContent":null,"Title":"What's a reasonable expectation of angular performance?","State":"open","Body":"So my app is slow. That slow part consists of iteration over medium complex components with another bunch of nested components inside\r\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/aoyc1er.png)\r\n\r\nTrying to render more than one of these started to add up a LOT of scripting time, up to the point where trying to render 10 of them caused 30 second freeze. \r\n\r\nThe first and biggest culprit I found was @angular/flex-layout, which, as you know, if you managed to click [deep enough](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/Performance-Considerations) inside the wiki can not handle more than a hundred of grids (since I used it inside like 10 of the nested components inside it easily added up to that critical number).\r\n\r\nBut even still, with flex-layout completely gone, trying to render 100 of these can take around 12 seconds, so I thought there must be sometimes else wrong and tried to establish a baseline on a completely fresh project.

The later includes author, time, and message information that is lacking from the former. It is also included in Git's `--follow-tags` option. This should allow us to push tags alongside release commits more atomically and hopefully eliminate or at least reduce the possibility of a race condition arising from CI starting on the release commit before the associated tag is pushed. Such a state causes CI failures, because they take the latest version from the most recent `v*` tag.\r\n\r\nI tested the flow on my local fork, but I can't test a real release unfortunately.

As far as I understand, the suggested replacement is to run `ng serve` with the desired locale every time.\r\n\r\nA little bit background here. We have 2 applications, every with 4 languages. For production, we build it with AOT as suggested. For development we use JIT and load corresponding translation depending on the browser URL (German for `/de/` for example), this mimics prod behavior. So, to switch translation and check how the interface looks in a different language, you just need to pick up another item in the language menu. The page reloads at the same URL but with a different language.

I have a specific use case with a drop list + boundary element, where I **always** want the drag items to be rendered under certain surrounding elements. When the drop list is sitting statically, it looks fine. But when I start dragging, the preview is rendered above everything else - which is okay for a lot of drag and drop scenarios but not mine.\r\n\r\nConsider drop shadow CSS styling. The drop shadow can visually extend beyond the drag boundary, while the element itself is still contained inside the drag boundary. As stated above, when the list and drag items are sitting statically, the drop shadow extending beyond the drag boundary is being hidden by the ordering/z-index/styling of other elements (which is what I want). The moment the preview element (w/ drop shadow applied) becomes active, it's drop shadow is completely visible and extending outside of the drag boundary and there is nothing I can do about it because the preview element is in a completely different DOM location (bottom of document body, on top of everything) nowhere near the drop list and it's neighboring elements.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anymore info.\r\n\r\nAlso, a public `dragRef.getPlaceholderElement()` method exists. Can a public `dragRef.getPreviewElement()` method also be added to allow accessing the preview element during hooks/events?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(drag-drop): Custom drag preview insertion location\" (#20055)"},{"Id":"663110298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T15:33:18","Actor":"lukejack","Number":"20056","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DragDrop): cdkDropListDropped fires from source rather than destination","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mvaic6\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This works, but the implementation still bugs me because the template is being stamped out in the view container, modifying the DOM, and then the drag preview element is immediately moved to bottom of the document body, modifying the DOM **again** (versus the other solution that only modifies the DOM once). Same idea for the placeholder template as well, how it is placed into the DOM and then immediately moved around (using `replaceChild`)...when it could just be put in the correct place from the start.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto made the following comment:\r\n>The idea behind inserting the view through the ViewContainerRef is to ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item. I agree that ideally we'd just create the element outside the DOM, but an alternate solution is to measure the element before the preview has been created.\r\n\r\nbut I am struggling to understand this comment (_\"ensure that it's inside the same view/DI hierarchy as drag item\"_). As far as I am aware, an injector cannot be specified when using `createEmbeddedView` and the injector used inside the preview template is simply the injector of the component in which the template is **defined**.\r\n\r\nIssue about this (still open...) from 3 years ago:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14935\r\n\r\nSo what would stamping a template out using \r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate, previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\nconst viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nhave anything to do with dependency injection? I feel like the answer is \"nothing\" but I might be misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n@crisbeto can you explain your comment in more detail as to why it is advantageous to use the view container and/or if something I've said above is not accurate?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20047","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"question(drag-drop): createEmbeddedView for drag preview/placeholder templates\" (#20047)"},{"Id":"662217361","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T20:12:41","Actor":"bmolinh","Number":"20046","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(map-info-window): Set Content Dynamically","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nFor it to be posible to set data to each marker placed on the google-map.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nReferencing a well described previous issue with a similar use case as mine:\r\n\r\nHello, is it possible to have a custom info window with data for each marker? I am using markers for each position of products and on the window I want to show some of the products data. The API allows to set content on the infoWindow reference by setting content for each marker, so I tried to set the content before I open it but on this component we can only `getContent()` there is no `setContent()` function.

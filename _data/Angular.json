This can interfere with CSS Grid/Flexbox flows, gaps, and alignment, forcing developers to add a global stylesheet rule like:\n\n```css\nrouter-outlet { display: none; }\n```\n\nor similar hacks.\n\nRelated to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54868967/how-to-get-angulars-router-outlet-to-work-with-css-grid\n\n### Motivation\n\n- Avoid layout artifacts (extra empty grid/flex item, unexpected inline box).\n- Reduce boilerplate and “magic CSS” in every app and library.\n- Make router behavior consistent with other Angular structural anchors, which use comment anchors and do not create a layout box.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n(any of the following would solve the problem)\n\n#### 1. Opt-in comment anchor for outlets\n\nAdd a configuration/flag so that router-outlet uses a comment node anchor (like `@if`) instead of an element. \nPossible shapes:\n\nRouter config:\n\n```typescript\nprovideRouter(routes, { outletAnchor: 'comment' /* | 'element' (default) */ });\n```\n\nOr attribute/boolean input on the outlet:\n\n```html\n<router-outlet anchor=\"comment\"></router-outlet>\n```\n\nOr provide control-flow directive:\n```html\n@router-outlet;\n\n@router-outlet (name: 'secondary');\n\n@router-outlet { placeholder };\n\n@router-outlet (name: 'secondary') { placeholder };\n```\n\n#### 2. Documented & bundled style\n\nOfficially document and ship a built-in global style (or recommend it prominently in the Router docs) so apps don’t need to rediscover it:\n\n```css\nrouter-outlet { display: none /* or display: contents */; }\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep relying on app-level CSS (`router-outlet { display:none }`).\nWorks, but it’s non-obvious, duplicated across apps, and easy to miss (especially inside Shadow DOM).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"router-outlet should not affect layout (option to render as non-box/anchor)\" (#64553)"},{"Id":"3534375324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-21T00:14:35","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"64552","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): use preview value in property editor","State":"open","Body":"This way only the `preview` property handles the `Signal()` wrapper (and not individual components anymore)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64552","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): use preview value in property editor\" (#64552)"},{"Id":"3534220627","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T22:58:46","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"64551","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transfer Cache updated with new Fetch Response API options and fixed HttpErrorResponse omissions","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds the following commits\r\n\r\n\r\nfix(http): handle missing redirected and responseType in HttpErrorResponse \r\n\r\nfeat(http): add redirected and responseType params to HttpTestingController.expectOne flush \r\n\r\nfeat(http): add redirected and responseType to transferCache with withHttpTransferCacheOptions\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In this, we encounter some issue we can't explain based on provided information and it seems to be counterintuitive in context of an eligible pattern:\n\n- have some raw data e.g. fetched via REST from a backend\n- have it qualified by wrapping each fetched record in a model instance adding a certain client-side API expected by components\n- assign the list of qualified model instances to a component e.g. for listing the items\n\nThe issue is with the attempt to qualify the data so that its information can be computed reactively in either model instance. AFAIU, due to having components using API of such model instances, the components' rendering is establishing active consumers resulting in the issue. Deferring this whole process e.g. by using setTimeout at some point might be a solution to break out of the circular dependency here. But this feels pretty hacky and signals feel a lot less useful this way.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-t-urban-angular-ng0600-issue?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR RuntimeError: NG0600: Writing to signals is not allowed in a `computed`\n    at debug_node-Dn-GvQJo.mjs:19694:15\n    at throwInvalidWriteToSignalError (signal-ePSl6jXn.mjs:445:5)\n    at signalSetFn (signal-ePSl6jXn.mjs:497:9)\n    at signalFn.set (root_effect_schedule…BxwqIgm.mjs:3610:34)\n    at new MyDataModel (main.ts:21:16)\n    at main.ts:80:39\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\n    at Object.source (main.ts:80:26)\n    at Object.producerRecomputeValue (untracked-2ouAFbCz.mjs:71:45)\n    at producerUpdateValueVersion (signal-ePSl6jXn.mjs:139:10)\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nsee linked StackBlitz which is based on Angular v20.\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAn equivalent pattern is working well e.g. in Vue. \n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-t-urban-vue-ng0600-issue-equivalent?file=src%2FApp.vue\n\nI understand, that this does not proof anything, but it is my intention to illustrate a limitation in Angular's current state of signals implementation covering certain IMHO highly eligible patterns.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64549","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NG0600 thrown when rendering qualified data in a template\" (#64549)"},{"Id":"3530458131","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T21:18:18","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"64528","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing RouterConfigOptions in ExtraOptions extends in Angular.dev","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe documentation currently shows the following definition for [ExtraOptions](https://angular.dev/api/router/ExtraOptions)\n```ts\ninterface ExtraOptions extends InMemoryScrollingOptions {\n```\n\nHowever, in the actual [source code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/router_config.ts#L187C1-L187C86), it’s defined as:\n\n```ts\nexport interface ExtraOptions extends InMemoryScrollingOptions, RouterConfigOptions {\n```\n\n \nThe documentation should reflect all extended interfaces, including RouterConfigOptions, to accurately represent the full interface definition.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing RouterConfigOptions in ExtraOptions extends in Angular.dev\" (#64528)"},{"Id":"3532293734","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T21:18:16","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"64539","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Extract multiple extends statements for interfaces","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #64528\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64539","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): Extract multiple extends statements for interfaces\" (#64539)"},{"Id":"3533600798","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T21:17:06","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"64548","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.3.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `d43a6ee` -> `e69c869` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `5042b2c` -> `ac0bbc2` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `5042b2c` -> `ac0bbc2` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - Every 2 hours, between 12:00 AM and 10:59 PM ( * 0-22/2 * * * ) in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Sometimes it just fails to import the ReactiveFormsModule all together. Occasionally it will pick the CDK to error on.\n\nIt can be quite difficult to reproduce as the errors don't offer many hints. Sometimes this error will just disappear for days, and then come back when you touch the webpack module even slightly. Even my repro repo sometimes just fixes itself, and then breaks again randomly. I've observed it both on MacOS and Windows. But it seems to be harder to fix on Windows. I've confirmed all the webpack modules are deduped and there is only a single copy of `@angular/forms` in each webpack module with `npm ls`.\n\nWhen we use it with module federation, the first build succeeds, but then the minute it live reloads, the errors flood back. It looks almost like it's resolving the imports incorrectly to the shared library from the error message, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe issue surfaced when we upgraded to Angular 19 from 15. Weirdly enough, it's only one of our webpack modules that seem to be doing it. All of the other webpack modules seem to be fine, and have identical `tsconfig` and `angular.json` to the home webpack module.\n\nSometimes, adding:\n`\"@angular/*\": [\"node_modules/@angular/*\"]` to the paths property in the tsconfig will fix it, but only in small scale recreations. It does not work in our larger application.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/jaxcksn/ng3004-repro\n\nThere are steps in the README.

This is a **different issue** than what `hasValidator()` solves.\r\n\r\n## 📸 Visual Evidence\r\n\r\n### The Problem: Functional Duplicates Accumulate\r\n![Min validator problem](https://github.com/samman06/angular/blob/fix/forms-prevent-functional-duplicate-validators/docs/images/min%2015%20error.png)\r\n*Screenshot showing confusing behavior: After adding min(15), control shows error from previous min(10) validator*\r\n\r\n![Min 5 validation](https://github.com/samman06/angular/blob/fix/forms-prevent-functional-duplicate-validators/docs/images/min%205.png)  \r\n*Different min validators accumulating instead of replacing*\r\n\r\n## 🔍 The Two Types of Duplicates\r\n\r\n### ✅ `hasValidator()` solves: Reference duplicates \r\n```typescript\r\nconst validator = Validators.required;\r\ncontrol.addValidators(validator);\r\nif (!control.hasValidator(validator)) {  // false - prevents duplicate\r\n  control.addValidators(validator);\r\n}\r\n// Works correctly: Only one validator instance added\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ❌ `hasValidator()` CANNOT solve: Functional duplicates\r\n```typescript\r\n// These are different objects but functionally identical:\r\nValidators.min(5) !== Validators.min(5)  // true - different instances!\r\n\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(10));\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(20));\r\n// hasValidator(control, Validators.min(20)) returns FALSE\r\n// because they're different instances\r\n\r\n// Result: Control now has BOTH min(10) AND min(20) active! ❌\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🚨 Current Confusing Behavior\r\n\r\n![Min 10 validation](https://github.com/samman06/angular/blob/fix/forms-prevent-functional-duplicate-validators/docs/images/min%2010.png)\r\n*Shows min(10) validator working correctly*\r\n\r\n![Min 15 working](https://github.com/samman06/angular/blob/fix/forms-prevent-functional-duplicate-validators/docs/images/min%2015.png)  \r\n*Value 15 should pass min validation, but...*\r\n\r\nThis creates **unexpected developer experience**:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst control = new FormControl(15);\r\n\r\n// Step 1: Add min(10) - works as expected\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(10));\r\nconsole.log(control.valid);  // true ✅ (15 >= 10)\r\nconsole.log(control.errors); // null\r\n\r\n// Step 2: Add min(20) - developer expects this to REPLACE min(10)\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(20));  \r\nconsole.log(control.valid);  // false ❌ - Confusing! Why is 15 invalid?\r\nconsole.log(control.errors); // { min: { min: 10, actual: 15 } } - min(10) still active!\r\n\r\n// 🤔 Developer confusion: \"I added min(20), why is min(10) still validating?\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Real-world scenario:**\r\n```typescript\r\n// User updates validation rules dynamically:\r\nif (userType === 'premium') {\r\n  control.addValidators(Validators.min(100)); // Should replace basic min(10)\r\n} else {\r\n  control.addValidators(Validators.min(10));  // Should replace premium min(100)\r\n}\r\n// Current behavior: BOTH validators remain active! ❌\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ✅ Solution: Smart Functional Deduplication\r\n\r\n### How It Works\r\n```typescript\r\n// After fix - intuitive behavior:\r\nconst control = new FormControl(15);\r\n\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(10));\r\nconsole.log(control.valid); // true ✅\r\n\r\ncontrol.addValidators(Validators.min(20)); // Replaces min(10) \r\nconsole.log(control.valid); // false ❌ \r\nconsole.log(control.errors); // { min: { min: 20, actual: 15 } } - Only min(20) active!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n- ✅ **Hash-based deduplication** - Uses function signature to identify duplicates\r\n- ✅ **Replace functionally identical** validators (`min(5)` replaces previous `min(5)`)\r\n- ✅ **Preserve different types** (`required` + `email` still accumulate correctly)  \r\n- ✅ **Minimal footprint** - ~20 lines, simple hash function, no regex parsing\r\n- ✅ **Backward compatible** - All existing valid use cases unchanged\r\n\r\n## 📊 Behavior Comparison\r\n\r\n| Scenario | Before Fix | After Fix |\r\n|----------|------------|-----------|\r\n| `min(10)` → `min(20)` | ❌ Both active | ✅ Only `min(20)` |\r\n| `required` → `email` | ✅ Both active | ✅ Both active |\r\n| Same validator instance twice | ✅ Only one (hasValidator works) | ✅ Only one |\r\n\r\n## 🧪 Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Enhanced `addValidators()` function with hash-based deduplication logic\r\n- Added `hashString()` helper function for validator signature identification  \r\n- Comprehensive test suite covering replacement vs accumulation scenarios\r\n- Tests verify backward compatibility for all existing use cases\r\n\r\n## 📋 Type of Change\r\n\r\n- [x] **Bug fix** (non-breaking change that fixes confusing behavior)\r\n- [x] **Includes comprehensive tests**\r\n- [ ] **Breaking change** (fully backward compatible)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Summary\r\n\r\nThis addresses a **developer experience pain point** where functional duplicates create unexpected validation behavior that `hasValidator()` cannot prevent. The fix makes `addValidators()` behave intuitively while maintaining full backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Before:** Confusing accumulation of functionally identical validators  \r\n**After:** Intuitive replacement behavior that developers expect","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64527","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(forms): prevent functional duplicate validators in addValidators\" (#64527)"},{"Id":"3530244167","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-19T16:55:07","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"64526","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): bind invalid input in custom controls","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

constructs the Algolia index name based on the user's project version (`angular_vXX`).\r\n- **Unbounded Max Version**: The tool can query for documentation versions newer than the CLI itself, making it forward-compatible.\r\n- **Robust Fallback**: If a search for a new or unknown version index fails, the tool automatically falls back to the latest known stable documentation index (`v20`) to ensure a result is always returned.\r\n- **Contextual Output**: The tool's output now includes the `searchedVersion`, informing the AI of the exact documentation version that was queried.\r\n- **Enhanced AI Guidance**: The tool's description has been updated to instruct the AI on the new versioning logic and how to use the `searchedVersion` field to provide more transparent and accurate

I noticed it affects the `new` and `add` commands, but I assume it affects every command.\n\nAfter a fresh installation, running `ng <whatever>` will prompt the user whether they are OK with setting up telemetry. My expectation is that commands like `ng add @angular/material --defaults` (or using `--skip-confirmation`) which contain flags that disable interactive prompts should also skip this telemetry interactive prompt.\n\nOtherwise, this causes automated tools and LLMs to halt if the tools do not support interactive prompts.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g @angukar/cli\nnpm install -g @google/gemini\n# <now install Angular MCP server in `.gemini/settings.json`>\n\ngemini\n```\nWait for Gemini to come up and prompt:\n```\nCreate an empty new Angular application using Angular best practices. Avoid interactive prompts.\n```\n\nHere, gemini got stuck because even though it was using `--defaults` and `--skip-confirmation` to avoid interactive prompts, the Angular CLI was still interactively asking whether the user wants to set up telemetry. That should not be asked when a flag disables interactive prompts\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nv20\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n(This was discussed internally already)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31507","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Do not prompt about setting up telemetry when using a flag that disables interactive prompts\" (#31507)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3534097834","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T22:03:33","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"32127","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(aria/toolbar): adds skip disabled toolbar example to dev-app","State":"open","Body":"Updates component-examples to add a toolbar skip disabled example and adds it to the dev-app for accessibility testing.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32127","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(aria/toolbar): adds skip disabled toolbar example to dev-app\" (#32127)"},{"Id":"3534007280","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T21:28:16","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"32126","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(aria/toolbar): adds toolbar basic vertical example to dev-app","State":"open","Body":"Updates components-examples and dev-app to implement a toolbar basic vertical example for accessibility testing.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32126","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(aria/toolbar): adds toolbar basic vertical example to dev-app\" (#32126)"},{"Id":"3534006100","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T21:27:42","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"32125","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/toolbar): update basic horizontal toolbar aria-label","State":"open","Body":"Updates basic horizontal toolbar aria-label to be more specific to communicate to the user that it is the horizontal text formatting toolbar.

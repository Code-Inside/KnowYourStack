They are not considered any more, in the DOM there are not loaded. This happens on the initial page call (served via ng serve).\nWhen forcing ng serve to rebuild and sent component update to the client byfollowing the steps:\n1.) change something and redo it \n2.) Save the file -> trigger the \"change detection\" \n3.) ng serve rebuilds automatically and sent component update command\nResult: The styles are loaded as expected. \n\nHaving 2 different components with ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom, and applying the Steps 1-3 only to one, the result is, that only the component styles of the \"changed\" component are loaded.

I don’t know how much information is available at this point. My dreamed-of error message would be something like this (drawing inspiration from [JoostK’s comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46441#issuecomment-1161376788)):\n\n> The type ${entity} could not be found. It seems to be a transitive dependency via this import chain:\n>  (root project) → (dependency) → (dependency) → ${entity}.\n> This typically happens when a library is linked from another directory tree, where the necessary dependencies are not in a location the compiler can find, for instance when there is no corresponding node_modules directory from within that tree.\n> Make sure that the library’s properly declares its dependencies and that they are installed.\n> If it is due to symbolic links, then setting `projects.${project}.architect.build.options.preserveSymlinks: true` in the angular.json file may help. Otherwise, explicit path mappings for the unresolved dependency may also help.\n\nAt the very least, the file that imports the unresolvable entity should be displayed, again as suggested by [JoostK](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52520#issuecomment-1794326712).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve error message `Cannot resolve type entity ${entity} to {symbol|declaration}`\" (#59731)"},{"Id":"2812481724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T09:23:01","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"59730","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): prepend `baseHref` to `sourceMappingURL` in CSS content","State":"open","Body":"\r\nImplemented functionality to prepend the baseHref to `sourceMappingURL` in CSS content.

incorrectly type a `viewChild()` (or `viewChildren()`) signal. For example:\n\n```\nreadonly myElement = viewChild<HTMLInputElement>('someSelector');\n```\n\nHere I am passing a generic argument, HTMLInputElement, but the element may have a different type. Often I forget to wrap the element within an `ElementRef`, as I did here, but I digress. The point is, I often waste time being unsure of what is actually being injected by Angular in the component class.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI believe that the easiest solution would be to include some kind of validator function:\n```\nreadonly myElement = viewChild('someSelector', { validator: e => e instanceof HTMLInputElement });\n```\n\nType signature would be as follows:\n\n```\n<T>(selector: string, options: { validator: (el: unknown) => el is T }) : Signal<T>;\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n**Alternative 1:**\n\nThe current API is not as ergonomic as it could be. Why can't the Angular Language service ensure that `myElement` is of the correct type:\n```\nreadonly myElement: HTMLElement;\n```\n... and in the template:\n```\n<input #myElement />    <!-- throw error here (if not of type HTMLElement) -->\n```\n\n**Alternative 2:**\n\nI thought about creating an external utility function that wraps the existing functionality but does an additional type check when the signal is invoked. I was unsuccessful. Perhaps you could tell me how to facilitate this.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide better type safety for viewChild (and viewChildren)\" (#59717)"},{"Id":"2811162279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T20:28:09","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59716","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): check whether application is destroyed before printing hydration stats","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we check whether the application is destroyed before printing hydration stats.

Afterwards, when a new value is emitted the resource will just update. This is fine!\n\nBut what if the implementation \"knows\" when it is fetching a value?\n\nExample 1: Polling\n\nImagine some API which doesn't support streaming, so it has to be polled. The \"poller\" would then know when it is going to fetch the next value (even on the same request).\n\nExample 2: Retry\n\nImagine some streaming resource implementation which automatically retries after an error occured. It will then know when it is \"Reloading\".\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend the type of the signal with\n\n```ts\n{ value: T }\n| { error: unknown }\n| { status: ResourceStatus.Loading | ResourceStatus.Reloading }\n```\nWhen the signal of the streaming resource emits a \"status\" the `Resource<T>` transitions to the given state (I don't think the other `ResourceStatus` values make sense here).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently the implementation would have to encode the (re)loading information into its value and that can't be populated to the `Resource<T>`'s status.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59712","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"extend streaming resource with {status} capability\" (#59712)"},{"Id":"2810880612","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T09:19:47","Actor":"json-derulo","Number":"59711","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): use custom data attribute as identifyer for test components","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If you have unescaped '{', use '{{ \"{\" }}' to escape it.`\nDespite this, the code compiles and runs correctly in the browser. It seems the IDE does not fully recognize the syntax, causing it to misinterpret braces within the template.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**Component:**\n```ts[]\nimport { Component, Input, signal } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-task-details',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    @if(task(); as currentTask;) {\n        <div class=\"task-details\">\n            <h2>Task Details</h2>\n            <p><strong>Title:</strong> {{ currentTask.title }}</p>\n            <p><strong>Status:</strong> {{ currentTask.completed ?

Use the provided component code in an Angular 19 standalone project.\n2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.\n3.

But of course, it's not possible to add it since it's internal Angular thing. Turns out that the comment is there already but having tsconfig to remove the comments when compiling, broke this system.\n\nWould it be possible\n- Document this some where in update guide that you probably do not want to have `removeComments` on?\n- Add it to the HRM warning message shown on start, that if removeComments is on, you should probably turn it off?\n- Isn't there any more robust system to turn that analysis off that Angular could use? Relying on comments seems really easy to break. I get that it's just a warning and doesn't really break anything. But it's little bit scary that you got 100 of these warnings after upgrade. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nYou can reproduce this by creating new Angular project and adding `\"removeComments\": true` to `tsconfig.json`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.4\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.4\n@angular/cli                    19.1.4\n@schematics/angular             19.1.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29470","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bunch of warnings: \"The above dynamic import cannot be analyzed by Vite.\"\" (#29470)"},{"Id":"2809116675","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T12:20:56","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29474","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): disable TypeScript `removeComments` option","State":"closed","Body":"Disables TypeScript's `removeComments` option to ensure important annotations like `/* @__PURE__ */` and `/* vite-ignore */` are preserved.

It's not the individual controls that are required, it's the group as a whole that must have one choice made from it.\n\nCode reference: https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/third_party/javascript/angular_components/src/material/radio/radio.ts;l=250-257;bpv=1;bpt=1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a radio button is used inside a radio group, if the group is required and does not have a default selection, then add `aria-required=\"true\"` to the wrapping element, not `aria-required/required` to the individual controls. We can leave it unchanged when a radio button is used outside a radio group, though I am unsure if that is a valid use case. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `required` attribute is applied to each radio button in a group.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

activates the TypeAhead for its `FocusKeyManager` automatically:\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e91d5091bbf3d44cc168be458269d260a0c22c27/src/cdk/menu/menu-base.ts#L175\n\nThe proposal would be to add an input like `cdkMenuTypeAhead: boolean` which defaults to true but can be used to skip the TypeAhead activation:\n```ts\nthis.keyManager = new FocusKeyManager(this.items).withWrap().withHomeAndEnd();\nif (this.cdkMenuTypeAhead) {\n  this.keyManager = this.keyManager.withTypeAhead()\n}\n```\n\n#### Alternative\n\nAn alternative approach might be a combination of the following features, so the described use case can be accomplished by the `CdkMenu` itself.\n1. Make the current search term (`_pressedLetters`) publicly available, so it can be displayed.\n2. Two variants to extend the current search logic:  \n  2.a Add a secondary `includes` search to the current `startsWith`.\n  2.b Make the search logic customizable with configurable predicate function.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThe use case is a custom search feature for our menus, which conflicts with the integrated TypeAhead.\nWe want to display the current search term and search by `startsWith` & `includes`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a9823aa-e645-4c02-98c8-71e8361e8178) ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be067fd8-0133-498d-a702-b3534632be16)\n\n***\n\n**🗨 I would appreciate some feedback, if this feature has a chance of being accepted.

This both simplifies the code and makes it easier to ship other operators like `??=` in the future. Summary:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): produce binary expressions instead of dedicated write ones\r\nCurrently our expression parser produces two different expressions for writes: `PropertyWrite` (e.g. `foo.bar = 123`) or `KeyedWrite` (e.g. `foo[0] = 123`). This is inconsistent with other ASTs, like TypeScript's, where writes are represented as binary expressions with a `=` operator and it makes it difficult to implement more write operators like `??=`, because we'd essentially have to duplicate them.\r\n\r\nThese changes switch the expression parser over to produce binary expressions instead.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): account for new assignment AST \r\nReworks the places that were depending on `PropertyWrite` and `KeyedWrite` to account for the new AST structure.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): replace output AST write nodes \r\nSimilarly to the previous change to the expression AST, these changes replace the `WriteVarExpr`, `WriteKeyExpr` and `WritePropExpr` from the output AST with a binary expression. This is closer aligned to TypeScript and makes it easier to translate code between the two.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61682","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Simplify assignment AST nodes\" (#61682)"},{"Id":"3090641508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-26T10:27:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61680","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `605518e` -> `39b8cbd` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `fd57e38` -> `241f7bc` |\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `fd57e38` -> `241f7bc` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Avoiding the need to load and parse a potentially large amount of code to perform the check can improve performance for the cases where no linking is required.

I made a script on the root monorepo level to run the script on all of the child applications. When I do this, it always seems to ADD a fake dependency to each of the app `package.json` files which is the name of that project\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOn the root level package I have this NPM script\n```\n\"update-angular-apps\": \"npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-1 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-2 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-3\",\n```\nAnd here is what the individual app package files look like\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"name-of-app-2\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"author\": \"Me\",\n  \"description\": \"My App #2\",\n  \"homepage\": \"https://company.com/app-2\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/redacted/app-2.git\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"update-angular\": \"ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material --allow-dirty\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint --fix --max-warnings=0\",\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.2.12\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"*\",\n    \"typescript\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the root level I run `npm run update-angular-apps` and it modifies the `package.json` files with all the correct updates, and then after a little bit of time it adds a fake package to `dependencies` as a final step. It is formatted  like\n```json\n\"name-of-app-2\": \"file:\"\n```\n\nand I have to manually delete this and re-run `npm install` on each child application since it does add an entry to the `package-lock.json` file for this as well\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.13\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.12\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.13\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.13\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.17\n@angular/cli                      19.2.13\n@angular/material                 19.2.17\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.17\n@schematics/angular               19.2.13\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThe root package does NOT have any Angular packages installed on it, only the child apps have them.

Being new to Angular, I was confused about whether that was naming the element that emitted an action that triggered the display of the overlay, given the name. \n\nIn fact, it does not matter where the show/hide behavior is triggered from. What this template ref variable is doing is identifying the attachment point.  \n\n**Details**\n\nIf you all agree with this idea, I'm happy to put in a PR for this myself as I realize it is a very small user experience enhancement and not anything critical. \n\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/cdk/overlay/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(overlay): Suggestion for semantically clearer naming in Overlay example\" (#31221)"},{"Id":"3089256033","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T12:08:34","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31218","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/card): use system outline","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31218","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/card): use system outline\" (#31218)"},{"Id":"3089176855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T12:03:15","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31217","RawContent":null,"Title":"Convert remaining tests to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Switches all remaining tests to standalone and enables linting that we don't create any more non-standalone directives.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31217","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Convert remaining tests to standalone\" (#31217)"},{"Id":"3089069941","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T06:06:44","Actor":"wbreakell","Number":"31216","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update contributing guidelines to reference TypeScript style guide","State":"open","Body":"The current contributing guidelines reference the outdated [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

[`v12.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/HEAD/changelog.md#1200-2024-04-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v11.7.1...v12.0.0)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v11.7.1...v12.0.0)\n\nWe expect this release to ship in the DevTools of [Chrome 126](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule), and to PageSpeed Insights within 2 weeks.\n\n#### New Contributors\n\nThanks to our new contributors 👽🐷🐰🐯🐻!\n\n-   Ashley Rich [@&#8203;A5hleyRich](https://redirect.github.com/A5hleyRich)\n-   MrAdib [@&#8203;JohnAdib](https://redirect.github.com/JohnAdib)\n\n#### Notable Changes\n\n##### PWA Category Removal\n\nAs per [Chrome’s updated Installability Criteria](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/update-install-criteria), Lighthouse [has removed the PWA category](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15455). For future PWA testing, users will be directed to use the [updated PWA documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/).\n\n##### SEO Category Reorganization\n\nThe SEO category has been updated to reflect the priorities of Google search in 2024. As such, several audits have been removed or moved to other categories:\n\n-   The `is-crawlable` audit is now weighted high enough to fail the SEO category on its own. ([#&#8203;15933](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15933))\n-   The `viewport` and `font-size` audits are no longer priorities for SEO, but are still important for UX in general so they have been moved to the best practices category. ([#&#8203;15930](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15930))\n-   The `plugins` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been removed. ([#&#8203;15928](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15928))\n-   The `tap-targets` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been replaced with the `target-size` audit in accessibility. ([#&#8203;15906](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15906))\n\n##### Overall Savings Deprecation\n\nThe `overallSavingsMs` value on performance diagnostic audits has been deprecated ([#&#8203;15902](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15902)). We recommend using `metricSavings.LCP` or `metricSavings.FCP` to understand the estimated metric savings of performance diagnostics.\n\n##### 🆕 New Audits\n\n-   The [`aria-conditional-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-conditional-attr), [`aria-deprecated-role`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-deprecated-role) and [`aria-prohibited-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-prohibited-attr) Axe checks have been added to the Lighthouse accessibility category. ([#&#8203;15963](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15963))\n-   The `redirects-http` audit has been brought back, but will only passively check for a http -> https redirect if the provided URL happens to be on http ([#&#8203;13548](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13548))\n\n##### Other Audit Changes\n\n-   The `layout-shifts-elements` audit is removed. Improved layout shift information can be found in the `layout-shifts` audit. ([#&#8203;15931](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15931))\n-   The `no-unload-listeners` audit is removed. Unload listeners are deprecated and are still flagged in the `deprecations` and `bf-cache` audits. ([#&#8203;15874](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15874))\n-   The `duplicate-id-active` audit is removed because it's corresponding Axe check is deprecated. ([#&#8203;15900](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15900))\n-   The `uses-rel-preload` and `preload-fonts` audits have been moved to the experimental config. Preload advice is still on hold and these audits were already in a disabled state. ([#&#8203;15876](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15876))\n\n#### 💥 Breaking Changes\n\n-   split up `CSSUsage` artifact

All the components are self contained, meaning the <mat-form-field><mat-label><component><mat-error> are inside our custom component, while the form is outside.\nSo ever since the upgrade (jump from 14 to 19) specifically the mat-error does not show until specifically clicked on the input. Regardless of any programmatical approach and actually debugging and seeing the error is present and the hasError returning true, the mat-error won't show unless physically clicked on the input. Additionally, with Autocomplete, label stops the field from being focused. I tried debugging and figuring out what and how happens and it all looks like the binding process can't correctly discern when we have an \"additional layer\" between the form tag and mat-form-field and the binding process fails. \nThe NgValueAccessor and MatFormFieldControl are both implemented and I can clearly see correct states for determining error and other states, however, the error specifically is not applied. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAs in version 14, I expect ALL the mat-form-fields to work properly regardless of how far inside the form they are. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe fields partially work.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19\n- Browser(s): All chromium based\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows/Mac\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): Custom Autocomplete component doesn't bind properly on form and other mat components\" (#31205)"},{"Id":"3085176195","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T05:05:20","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31204","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency karma-jasmine-html-reporter to v2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`~1.7.0` -> `~2.1.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`^1.5.4` -> `^2.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter (karma-jasmine-html-reporter)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0)\n\n-   Add jasmine 5 as a compatible peer dependency\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0\n\n### [`v2.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v1.7.0...v2.0.0)\n\nThis version rewrites the package to use the peer jasmine-core package instead of repackaging the html reporting code.

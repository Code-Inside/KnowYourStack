These old style escapes support 4 hexadecimal chars only (`\"\\u0000\"` to `\"\\uFFFF\"`). So these longer Strings get simply chopped of after the 4 right-most hexadecimal chars.\r\n\r\nI guess Angular would compile HTML `&#x1FFFF;` into JS `\"\\uFFFF\"` (missing `1`).\r\n\r\n## Why do I think so?\r\n\r\nIt just looks like it in the compiled templates of my example.

At least, this seems to be the case when the token is typed to a type that does not have a runtime representation, such as an interface - but note that precisely this case is what the example, and the text blocks around it, are all about.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nI am in a situation where I need to provide a generically typed interface implementation on one side, and inject this very interface, generically typed, on the other side (e.g. of a component outlet).\r\n\r\nTo get the injection token with the correct type, I had a factory object generate the `InjectionToken` instance with the correct type parameter from a function in both the provider and the injection call.\r\n\r\nI was looking for confirmation that this can work, and the example showing that I can pass a newly instantiated `InjectionToken` to `injector.get` seemed to confirm this.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nI ran a little experiment, by declaring a provider, passing it to a component outlet, and trying to inject that provided value.\r\n\r\nWhen I called the `InjectionToken` constructor (e.g. like this: `new InjectionToken<ITestInfo>('test-info')`, with `ITestInfo` being a commonly accessible interface) both in the provider and the inject call (with the same type argument and desc value), I would get a `NullInjectorException`.\r\n\r\nWhen I used one and the same `InjectionToken` in both places, on the other hand, this worked without errors.\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n- A clear statement that, when typing the injection token to an interface type (or presumably, at least any type without a runtime representation), using the same _instance_ of `InjectionToken` in both provider and injection call is crucial.\r\n- A change of the misleading example to make clear that the same _instance_ of `InjectionToken` has to be passed to `injector.get` as what was used to provide the value.\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n```true\r\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(ModulesExampleTopicOneModule)[InjectionToken test-info -> InjectionToken test-info -> InjectionToken test-info]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken test-info!\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51270","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Example code for injection token is misleading/does not work this way\" (#51270)"},{"Id":"1836108652","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T08:02:57","Actor":"alkavats1","Number":"51268","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: removed the redundant initializer in router file","State":"closed","Body":"q param equals to null is behaving like redundant initializer\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If we moved to transloco, we would then implement a `withTransloco` function to work the same way.\r\n\r\nIf things like this could be added to the framework, I think it'd be a great addition and it could provide a sort of _guideline_ for third-party libs maker (just like there is a guideline from RxJS to create your custom operators)\r\n\r\n> I've never used the i18n package made by angular so, as we currently made it, it may be incomplete or not adapted yet but, with the help of the community we could finally have an easy way to set up translations in our apps\r\n\r\n> If this feature request harvests all the features specs needed for such a providefn and withXxx functions, it could be my very first contribution on angular :smile: (plus I could also open PRs on third-party libs like ngx-translate to make the withXxx functions)\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nLike I said above, a `provideTranslation` function with, for example a `locale` and `localeData` arguments.\r\n\r\nIn addition add a `...transaltionFeatures: TranslationFeature[]` to let third-party libraries maker create their `withXxx` functions to configure their lib (like `withNgxTranslate` for example)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of the first two arguments we could pass an object of options in wich we could either :\r\n- add the locale / localeData\r\n- or an autoDetect `boolean` option\r\n- or even a factory to provide locales based on a specific logic\r\n- or anything else I could not think of","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51264","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a `provideTranslation` function to the framework (plus add a guideline to create `withXxx` features from third-party libs like ngx-translate\" (#51264)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1837904272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-07T22:59:45","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25643","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency eslint-config-prettier to v9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [eslint-config-prettier](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) | devDependencies | major | [`8.10.0` -> `9.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint-config-prettier/8.10.0/9.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier (eslint-config-prettier)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.0.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-900-2023-08-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.10.0...v9.0.0)\n\n-   Added: The CLI helper tool now works with eslint.config.js (flat config). Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the \\[ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the *config* of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) – it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.\n-   Changed: \\[unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add `\"unicode-bom\": \"off\"` to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with `--fix` to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM).

So, my guess is where it's checking the error type, to decide whether to absorb the error or re-throw, it needs to consider this error type too (`ENOTDIR`)?\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c34bbb8dad26aca180c2f9f4e1a6ecc5c28dd3c0/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/node-module-engine-host.ts#L69-L73\r\n\r\nSeeing as this code isn't in the test-specific class, I suspect (but haven't verified) this might also fail for the `@angular-devkit/schematics` `externalSchematics` function.\r\n\r\nReproduction Repo: https://github.com/michaelfaith/ng-schematics-yarn-pnp-bug\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @michaelfaith in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16980#issuecomment-1640917890_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug: running \"external\" schematics in yarn pnp workspace\" (#25648)"},{"Id":"1838930974","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-07T09:05:36","Actor":"graphicsxp","Number":"25647","RawContent":null,"Title":"error: Module \"mymodule\" has no exported member \"mycomponent\"  after upgrading to angular 16","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore, Don't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\ni am using an angular workspace with a blend of applications and libraries of my own which are used by these applications.

However, the Webpack-based build system currently unconditionally enables the option.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25639","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): conditionally enable deprecated Less stylesheet JavaScript support\" (#25639)"},{"Id":"1836106831","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T18:49:14","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"25628","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove duplicate words","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.18...v0.18.19)\n\n-   Implement `composes` from CSS modules ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release implements the `composes` annotation from the [CSS modules specification](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules#composition). It provides a way for class selectors to reference other class selectors (assuming you are using the `local-css` loader). And with the `from` syntax, this can even work with local names across CSS files. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import { submit } from './style.css'\n    const div = document.createElement('div')\n    div.className = submit\n    document.body.appendChild(div)\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* style.css */\n    .button {\n      composes: pulse from \"anim.css\";\n      display: inline-block;\n    }\n    .submit {\n      composes: button;\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* anim.css */\n    @&#8203;keyframes pulse {\n      from, to { opacity: 1 }\n      50% { opacity: 0.5 }\n    }\n    .pulse {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Bundling this with esbuild using `--bundle --outdir=dist --loader:.css=local-css` now gives the following:\n\n    ```js\n    (() => {\n      // style.css\n      var submit = \"anim_pulse style_button style_submit\";\n\n      // app.js\n      var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n      div.className = submit;\n      document.body.appendChild(div);\n    })();\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* anim.css */\n    @&#8203;keyframes anim_pulse {\n      from, to {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      50% {\n        opacity: 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n    .anim_pulse {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite anim_pulse;\n    }\n\n    /* style.css */\n    .style_button {\n      display: inline-block;\n    }\n    .style_submit {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Import paths in the `composes: ... from` syntax are resolved using the new `composes-from` import kind, which can be intercepted by plugins during import path resolution when bundling is enabled.\n\n    Note that the order in which composed CSS classes from separate files appear in the bundled output file is deliberately ***undefined*** by design (see [the specification](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules#composing-from-other-files) for details). You are not supposed to declare the same CSS property in two separate class selectors and then compose them together. You are only supposed to compose CSS class selectors that declare non-overlapping CSS properties.\n\n    Issue [#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20) (the issue tracking CSS modules) is esbuild's most-upvoted issue! With this change, I now consider esbuild's implementation of CSS modules to be complete. There are still improvements to make and there may also be bugs with the current implementation, but these can be tracked in separate issues.\n\n-   Fix non-determinism with `tsconfig.json` and symlinks ([#&#8203;3284](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3284))\n\n    This release fixes an issue that could cause esbuild to sometimes emit incorrect build output in cases where a file under the effect of `tsconfig.json` is inconsistently referenced through a symlink. It can happen when using `npm link` to create a symlink within `node_modules` to an unpublished package. The build result was non-deterministic because esbuild runs module resolution in parallel and the result of the `tsconfig.json` lookup depended on whether the import through the symlink or not through the symlink was resolved first. This problem was fixed by moving the `realpath` operation before the `tsconfig.json` lookup.\n\n-   Add a `hash` property to output files ([#&#8203;3084](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3084), [#&#8203;3293](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3293))\n\n    As a convenience, every output file in esbuild's API now includes a `hash` property that is a hash of the `contents` field. This is the hash that's used internally by esbuild to detect changes between builds for esbuild's live-reload feature. You may also use it to detect changes between your own builds if its properties are sufficient for your use case.\n\n    This feature has been added directly to output file objects since it's just a hash of the `contents` field, so it makes conceptual sense to store it in the same location. Another benefit of putting it there instead of including it as a part of the watch mode API is that it can be used without watch mode enabled. You can use it to compare the output of two independent builds that were done at different times.\n\n    The hash algorithm (currently [XXH64](https://xxhash.com/)) is implementation-dependent and may be changed at any time in between esbuild versions. If you don't like esbuild's choice of hash algorithm then you are welcome to hash the contents yourself instead. As with any hash algorithm, note that while two different hashes mean that the contents are different, two equal hashes do not necessarily mean that the contents are equal. You may still want to compare the contents in addition to the hashes to detect with certainty when output files have been changed.\n\n-   Avoid generating duplicate prefixed declarations in CSS ([#&#8203;3292](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3292))\n\n    There was a request for esbuild's CSS prefixer to avoid generating a prefixed declaration if a declaration by that name is already present in the same rule block. So with this release, esbuild will now avoid doing this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    body {\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=safari12) */\n    body {\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=safari12) */\n    body {\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This can result in a visual difference in certain cases (for example if the browser understands `blur(30px)` but not `blur(45px)`, it will be able to fall back to `blur(30px)`). But this change means esbuild now matches the behavior of [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) which is probably a good representation of how people expect this feature to work.\n\n### [`v0.18.18`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01818)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.17...v0.18.18)\n\n-   Fix asset references with the `--line-limit` flag ([#&#8203;3286](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3286))\n\n    The recently-released `--line-limit` flag tells esbuild to terminate long lines after they pass this length limit. This includes automatically wrapping long strings across multiple lines using escaped newline syntax. However, using this could cause esbuild to generate incorrect code for references from generated output files to assets in the bundle (i.e. files loaded with the `file` or `copy` loaders). This is because esbuild implements asset references internally using find-and-replace with a randomly-generated string, but the find operation fails if the string is split by an escaped newline due to line wrapping. This release fixes the problem by not wrapping these strings. This issue affected asset references in both JS and CSS files.\n\n-   Support local names in CSS for `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release extends support for local names in CSS files loaded with the `local-css` loader to cover the `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` rules (and also `animation`, `list-style`, and `container` declarations). Here's an example:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes pulse {\n      from, to { opacity: 1 }\n      50% { opacity: 0.5 }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: 🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container squish {\n      li { float: left }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n      list-style: inside moon;\n      container: squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With the `local-css` loader enabled, that CSS will be turned into something like this (with the local name mapping exposed to JS):\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes stdin_pulse {\n      from, to {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      50% {\n        opacity: 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style stdin_moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: 🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container stdin_squish {\n      li {\n        float: left;\n      }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite stdin_pulse;\n      list-style: inside stdin_moon;\n      container: stdin_squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use a global name within a file loaded with the `local-css` loader, you can use a `:global` selector to do that:\n\n    ```css\n    div {\n      /* All symbols are global inside this scope (i.e.\n       * \"pulse\", \"moon\", and \"squish\" are global below) */\n      :global {\n        animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n        list-style: inside moon;\n        container: squish / size;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use `@keyframes`, `@counter-style`, or `@container` with a global name, make sure it's in a file that uses the `css` or `global-css` loader instead of the `local-css` loader. For example, you can configure `--loader:.module.css=local-css` so that the `local-css` loader only applies to `*.module.css` files.\n\n-   Support strings as keyframe animation names in CSS ([#&#8203;2555](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse animation names that are specified as strings and will convert them to identifiers. The CSS specification allows animation names to be specified using either identifiers or strings but Chrome only understands identifiers, so esbuild will now always convert string names to identifier names for Chrome compatibility:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" {\n      from { opacity: 1 }\n      to { opacity: 0 }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" { from { opacity: 1 } to { opacity: 0 } }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes hide\\ menu {\n      from {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      to {\n        opacity: 0;\n      }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out hide\\ menu;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>less/less.js (less)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.2.0`](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.64`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve (resolve)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.22.4`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n### [`v1.22.3`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.4.9`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small449-2023-08-07-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v4.4.8...v4.4.9)\n\n-   chore: fix eslint warnings ([#&#8203;14031](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14031)) ([4021a0e](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4021a0e)), closes [#&#8203;14031](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14031)\n-   chore(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;13938](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13938)) ([a1b519e](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/a1b519e)), closes [#&#8203;13938](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13938)\n-   fix: dynamic import vars ignored warning ([#&#8203;14006](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14006)) ([4479431](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4479431)), closes [#&#8203;14006](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14006)\n-   fix(build): silence warn dynamic import module when inlineDynamicImports true ([#&#8203;13970](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13970)) ([7a77aaf](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/7a77aaf)), closes [#&#8203;13970](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13970)\n-   perf: improve build times and memory utilization ([#&#8203;14016](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14016)) ([9d7d45e](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/9d7d45e)), closes [#&#8203;14016](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14016)\n-   perf: replace startsWith with === ([#&#8203;14005](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14005)) ([f5c1224](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/f5c1224)), closes [#&#8203;14005](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14005)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Currently, the available mat-list component has some limitations, particularly when dealing with longer descriptions and on mobile devices. To address these issues and enhance the overall user experience, I propose the development of a new \"Description List\" component for Angular Material.\r\n\r\n## Feature Overview\r\n\r\nThe Description List component will aim to simplify the display of descriptive information, especially when dealing with lengthy content. It will provide the following key features to cater to different screen sizes and use cases:\r\n\r\n- **Unrestricted Height on Mobile**\r\nOn mobile devices, the Description List component will be designed to occupy the available vertical space without any height limitation. This will ensure that users can view all the content without any truncation or text ellipsis, offering a seamless browsing experience on smaller screens.\r\n- **Responsive Design**\r\nThe Description List component will be responsive to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. On mobile devices, it will provide an intuitive and easy-to-read layout, while on desktops or larger screens, it will take advantage of the additional space by displaying terms and descriptions side by side.\r\n- **Flexibility in Content Display**\r\nThe Description List component will allow users to input varying lengths of labels and descriptions. It will dynamically adjust the layout based on the content's length, ensuring that information is presented in a visually appealing manner while maintaining readability.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nIntroducing the Description List component will offer several benefits to developers and end-users:\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced User Experience**\r\nBy providing an improved and responsive display for lengthy descriptive information, users can easily comprehend product characteristics and other details without any truncation or clutter.\r\n- **Consistency with Angular Material**\r\nThe new component will seamlessly integrate into the existing Angular Material ecosystem, maintaining the consistent and professional look and feel users have come to expect.\r\n- **Reduced Development Efforts**\r\nDevelopers will save time and effort by utilizing this out-of-the-box component for displaying detailed information, rather than resorting to custom solutions or third-party libraries.\r\n- **Mobile-Friendly**\r\nWith unrestricted height on mobile devices, the Description List component will cater to an increasing number of users accessing applications on their smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Ideas\r\n\r\nThe Description List component can be implemented by creating a new Angular Material module that includes the necessary CSS styles and layout logic or use the current `MatListModule`. It can leverage Angular's flexbox and grid systems to achieve the responsive layout and dynamic adjustments based on the content's length.\r\n\r\n#### Code Example (Potential Usage):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Component only -->\r\n<mat-description-list>\r\n  <mat-description-term>Product Name:</mat-description-term>\r\n  <mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</mat-description-details>\r\n\r\n  <mat-description-term>Product Code:</mat-description-term>\r\n  <mat-description-details>ABC123</mat-description-details>\r\n</mat-description-list>\r\n\r\n<!-- with actual <dl> <dt> and <dd> -->\r\n<dl mat-description-list>\r\n  <dt mat-description-term>Product Name:</dt>\r\n  <dd mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt mat-description-term>Product Code:</dt>\r\n  <dd mat-description-details>ABC123</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<!-- with wrapping div that could lead to mat-icon usage. (cf. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-dl-element) -->\r\n<dl mat-description-list>\r\n  <div mat-description-list-item>\r\n    <dt mat-description-term>Product Name:</dt>\r\n    <dd mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</dd>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div mat-description-list-item>\r\n    <dt mat-description-term>Product Code:</dt>\r\n    <dd mat-description-details>ABC123</dd>\r\n  </div>\r\n</dl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Description List component to Angular Material will significantly improve the display of descriptive information, particularly in scenarios with lengthy product characteristics or similar content. The component's responsiveness and flexibility will ensure an optimal user experience across different devices, making it a valuable addition to the Angular Material library.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature request. I believe that this enhancement will greatly benefit the Angular Material community and contribute to a more robust and user-friendly UI framework. I look forward to seeing this feature become a reality :). Thank you for all your efforts.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27591","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(list): Introducing a Description List Component\" (#27591)"},{"Id":"1838936900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-07T12:20:27","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27590","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/form-field): switch custom typography styles to tokens","State":"closed","Body":"Switches our custom typography styles on top of MDC to use tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27590","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/form-field): switch custom typography styles to tokens\" (#27590)"},{"Id":"1838085064","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-07T12:19:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27589","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add tokens test for form field","State":"closed","Body":"A tokens test wasn't added in #27548, because MDC wasn't exporting the light theme variable that we validate against.

When I type in a date that is after the max date, and then open the calendar, a marker appears on both the date I typed in and the max date. This behaviour could arguably be slightly confusing to the user but it is particularly misleading in the instance that the highlighted max date is actually disabled due to custom validation. The same issue can be seen for the minimum date.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/71448881/a2f4c43d-61f4-4ee1-be13-9cd381d7e33f)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=package.json (an example from the docs)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In datepicker-min-max-example.ts, adjust the max date so that it is not the last day of the month (so that the issue can be seen) e.g. change it to the 15th\r\n2. In the input, type in a date which is after the max date - e.g. the 18th\r\n3. Open the calendar and you will see that two dates are highlighted - the date that was typed in and the maximum date.\r\n4. Provide a custom validator that would render the maximum date disabled e.g. if the max date was a Sunday but weekends are not allowed. Repeat steps 2 & 3 and you will see that this date is highlighted even though it is invalid.\r\n5. Same steps for minimum date.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI am expecting to see only one date highlighted on the calendar - just the (invalid one) that was typed in. If this is not desired, then it should still take into account other invalid/disabled dates through customer validator, so it should highlight the maximum valid date rather than the general maximum date regardless of its validity. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI saw two dates highlighted on the calendar - the date I typed in and the maximum date. The maximum date is also highlighted even when it has been rendered invalid by a custom validator, which could be misleading to users - this is the main issue.

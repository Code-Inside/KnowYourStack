This could dramatically reduce bundle size and improve startup performance, especially for mobile and embedded applications.\n\n**Motivation:**\nAngular’s Ivy compiler already emits fine-grained JS instructions.\nWith the recent move to Signals and away from Zone.js, Angular could further minimize its runtime dependency.\nSimilar “compile away the framework” approaches (e.g., Svelte, Solid) show strong performance benefits.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduced bundle size and faster cold starts\n- Lower memory usage\n- Potential “Angular Lite” variant for low-resource environments\n\n**Related Work:**\n- React Compiler (Forget)\n- Svelte compile-to-DOM approach\n- Angular Ivy / Signals architecture\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend AOT to inline static template bindings as direct DOM operations.\nRetain a minimal runtime for DI, event binding, and reactive state updates.\nMake this an opt-in build mode to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRelying on Ivy AOT compilation alone: Angular’s Ahead-of-Time compilation and tree-shaking already reduce runtime overhead, but they still depend on a fairly large core runtime (zone.js, change detection, DI).

Run `npm run build`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. Try changing url in url bar to /lt and back to /\n5. Everything should work\n\nScenario 2: running just EN build **works**:\nSteps:\n1. Run `npm run build:en`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. Works (EN page is displayed)\n\nScenario 3: running just LT build **does not work**:\nSteps:\n1. Run `npm run build:lt`\n2. Run `npm run serve:ssr:locale-manifest-issue`\n3. Open it in the browser\n4. **Does not work** (LT page is not displayed neither on /lt nor on root url)\n\nLooking at the compiled output of Scenario 3, I can find the culprit in `dist/locale-manifest-issue/server/server.mjs` `getEntryPointExportsForUrl` function:\n```\ngetEntryPointExportsForUrl(t) {\n  let { basePath: n } = this.manifest;\n  if (this.supportedLocales.length === 1) return this.getEntryPointExports(''); // <---- Delete this line\n  let r = cm(t, n);\n  return this.getEntryPointExports(r) ?? this.getEntryPointExports('');\n}\n```\nWhen there's a single locale, Angular always just assumes that the entrypoint is in server root. However, for LT locale, the entrypoint is actually in `lt` folder (`dist/locale-manifest-issue/server/lt/main.server.mjs`).\nDeleting the line marked with \"// <---- Delete this line\" comment fixes the issue. Meaning that visiting /lt now works as expected.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nNode: 22.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.4.2\nOS: linux x64\n

[plugin-transform-class-static-block](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-class-static-block), with the Webpack builder, the output is transformed in such a way it breaks existing code.\n\nAngular code compiled and bundled with `@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block@7.27.1`:\n```ts\nlet CodeEditorWidget = class CodeEditorWidget extends _base_common_lifecycle_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.Disposable {\n  static #_ = CodeEditorWidget_1 = this;\n  static #_2 = this.dropIntoEditorDecorationOptions = _common_model_textModel_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_27__.ModelDecorationOptions.register({\n    description: 'workbench-dnd-target',\n    className: 'dnd-target'\n  }); //#endregion\n  get isSimpleWidget() {\n    return this._configuration.isSimpleWidget;\n  }\n  get contextMenuId() {\n    return this._configuration.contextMenuId;\n  }\n  constructor(domElement, _options, codeEditorWidgetOptions, instantiationService, codeEditorService, commandService, contextKeyService, themeService, notificationService, accessibilityService, languageConfigurationService, languageFeaturesService) {\n    var _this;\n    super();\n    _this = this;\n\n   // Omitted for brevity\n};\n```\n\nAngular code compiled and bundled with `@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block@7.28.3`:\n```ts\nlet CodeEditorWidget = (class CodeEditorWidget extends _base_common_lifecycle_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__.Disposable {                 \n  //#endregion\n  get isSimpleWidget() {\n    return this._configuration.isSimpleWidget;\n  }\n  get contextMenuId() {\n    return this._configuration.contextMenuId;\n  }\n  constructor(domElement, _options, codeEditorWidgetOptions, instantiationService, codeEditorService, commandService, contextKeyService, themeService, notificationService, accessibilityService, languageConfigurationService, languageFeaturesService) {\n    var _this = this;\n    super();\n\n    // Omitted for brevity\n\n  static #_ = _staticBlock = () => (CodeEditorWidget_1 = this, this.dropIntoEditorDecorationOptions = _common_model_textModel_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_27__.ModelDecorationOptions.register({\n    description: 'workbench-dnd-target',\n    className: 'dnd-target'\n  }), this);\n}, _staticBlock());\n```\n\nThe workaround, which you will also see explained in the attached reproducer, is to override the version of the Babel's plugin to 7.27.1.\n\nI don't understand why, and under which circumstance, that plugin is injected into the compilation process.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce can be found on the reproducer's repository:

Also, we do not want to make use of any `ServerRoutes` features, as anyway all routes should be SSR, and redirects or status codes will already be handled by the application logic.\n\nIn order to enforce all routes being SSR, I had to explicitly configure the app server config with:\n```typescript\nprovideServerRendering(\n  withRoutes([\n    {\n      path: '**',\n      renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n    }\n  ])\n)\n```\n## Issue 1:\nThere's no global switch to simply turn off SSG and I'm forced to add `withRoutes` with a catch-all route, even though I do not want to use any of the related features. \n\nHence it would be very useful to introduce a `withNoRoutes()` option, which also should disable the initial route evaluation/extraction while running a dev server - which is simply wasted computation time in our case.\n\nAs I do not want SSG, I already configured `\"outputMode\": \"server\"` in angular.json. I'm wondering why this setting isn't enough to turn off SSG completely, so that all pages will be SSR by default, not requiring `withRoutes()` configured.\n\n## Issue 2:\nOur routing setup includes a lot of lazy-load child routes. If one of the child routes has a matcher applied, then I get the below error:\n> Error: Error(s) occurred while extracting routes:\n> The route 'test/**' has a defined matcher but does not match any route in the server routing configuration. Please ensure this route is added to the server routing configuration.\n\nMy (simplified) routing setup is as follows:\n\nApp routes:\n```typescript\n{\n  path: 'test',\n  loadChildren: () => import('@my-app/test/feature').then(m => m.testFeatureRoutes)\n},\n```\nTest feature routes:\n```typescript\n  {\n    path: '',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n    component: TestComponent\n  },\n  {\n    matcher: () => null, <-- this guy here causes the error\n    component: TestComponent\n  },\n```\n\nAm I really forced now to add for all such routes a dedicated entry like `test/**` to ServerRoutes? In cases with very dynamic routing it seems to me also impossible or at least cumbersome to add all required sub-route catch-alls. Also, it's actually quite bad DX if one is bothered with having to solve errors for features he/she doesn't want to use anyway. \n\nSo, to me the both issues I described are tightly coupled: \nIf I would be able to turn off server routing completely, I wouldn't have to solve the problems with the catch-alls when using matchers.\n\nLooking forward to some answers explaining to me what can be done to get around the above mentioned obstacles.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n-\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nSee above\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.5\nNode: 22.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.3\nOS: linux x64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.5\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.5\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.8\n@angular/cli                    20.3.5\n@angular/google-maps            20.2.8\n@angular/ssr                    20.3.5\n@angular/youtube-player         20.2.8\n@schematics/angular             20.3.5\nng-packagr                      20.3.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.9.3\nzone.js                         0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31666","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problems and errors with enforcing SSR using ServerRoutes\" (#31666)"},{"Id":"3573522591","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-31T14:38:30","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31663","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pnpm to v10.20.0 (21.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/tree/HEAD/pnpm)) | [`10.19.0` -> `10.20.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pnpm/10.19.0/10.20.0) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/pnpm/10.20.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/pnpm/10.20.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/pnpm/10.19.0/10.20.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/pnpm/10.19.0/10.20.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>\n\n### [`v10.20.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10200)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.19.0...v10.20.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Support `--all` option in `pnpm --help` to list all commands [#&#8203;8628](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8628).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When the `latest` version doesn't satisfy the maturity requirement configured by `minimumReleaseAge`, pick the highest version that is mature enough, even if it has a different major version [#&#8203;10100](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10100).\n- `create` command should not verify patch info.\n- Set `managePackageManagerVersions` to `false`, when switching to a different version of pnpm CLI, in order to avoid subsequent switches [#&#8203;10063](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10063).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v0.25.12`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02512)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.11...v0.25.12)\n\n- Fix a minification regression with CSS media queries ([#&#8203;4315](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4315))\n\n  The previous release introduced support for parsing media queries which unintentionally introduced a regression with the removal of duplicate media rules during minification. Specifically the grammar for `@media <media-type> and <media-condition-without-or> { ... }` was missing an equality check for the `<media-condition-without-or>` part, so rules with different suffix clauses in this position would incorrectly compare equal and be deduplicated. This release fixes the regression.\n\n- Update the list of known JavaScript globals ([#&#8203;4310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4310))\n\n  This release updates esbuild's internal list of known JavaScript globals. These are globals that are known to not have side-effects when the property is accessed. For example, accessing the global `Array` property is considered to be side-effect free but accessing the global `scrollY` property can trigger a layout, which is a side-effect. This is used by esbuild's tree-shaking to safely remove unused code that is known to be side-effect free. This update adds the following global properties:\n\n  From [ES2017](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2017/):\n\n  - `Atomics`\n  - `SharedArrayBuffer`\n\n  From [ES2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/):\n\n  - `BigInt64Array`\n  - `BigUint64Array`\n\n  From [ES2021](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/):\n\n  - `FinalizationRegistry`\n  - `WeakRef`\n\n  From [ES2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/):\n\n  - `Float16Array`\n  - `Iterator`\n\n  Note that this does not indicate that constructing any of these objects is side-effect free, just that accessing the identifier is side-effect free. For example, this now allows esbuild to tree-shake classes that extend from `Iterator`:\n\n  ```js\n  // This can now be tree-shaken by esbuild:\n  class ExampleIterator extends Iterator {}\n  ```\n\n- Add support for the new `@view-transition` CSS rule ([#&#8203;4313](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4313))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now has improved support for pretty-printing and minifying the new `@view-transition` rule (which esbuild was previously unaware of):\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n\n  /* Old output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition { navigation: auto; types: check; }\n\n  /* New output */\n  @&#8203;view-transition {\n    navigation: auto;\n    types: check;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The new view transition feature provides a mechanism for creating animated transitions between documents in a multi-page app. You can read more about view transition rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;view-transition).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;yisibl](https://redirect.github.com/yisibl).\n\n- Trim CSS rules that will never match\n\n  The CSS minifier will now remove rules whose selectors contain `:is()` and `:where()` as those selectors will never match. These selectors can currently be automatically generated by esbuild when you give esbuild nonsensical input such as the following:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  div:before {\n    color: green;\n    &.foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}:is().foo{color:red}\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false --minify) */\n  div:before{color:green}\n  ```\n\n  This input is nonsensical because CSS nesting is (unfortunately) not supported inside of pseudo-elements such as `:before`. Currently esbuild generates a rule containing `:is()` in this case when you tell esbuild to transform nested CSS into non-nested CSS. I think it's reasonable to do that as it sort of helps explain what's going on (or at least indicates that something is wrong in the output). It shouldn't be present in minified code, however, so this release now strips it out.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sindresorhus/globals (globals)</summary>\n\n### [`v16.5.0`](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/releases/tag/v16.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/compare/v16.4.0...v16.5.0)\n\n- Update globals (2025-11-01) ([#&#8203;316](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/316))  [`6d441ca`](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/commit/6d441ca)\n- Add Vue, Svelte, and Astro globals ([#&#8203;314](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/314))  [`ea31521`](https://redirect.github.com/sindresorhus/globals/commit/ea31521)\n\n***\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jsdom/jsdom (jsdom)</summary>\n\n### [`v27.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2710)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/27.0.1...27.1.0)\n\n- Improved CSS parsing by switching to [`@acemir/cssom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;acemir/cssom), including support for nested selectors, nested declarations, layer statements, and improved at-rule validation.

Desktop and Android devices do not experience this issue. Similar symptoms have been reported by other projects ([[github.com](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/13848#:~:text=player%20configuration%20error%20153,on%20if%20you%27re%20using%20web)](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/13848#:~:text=player%20configuration%20error%20153,on%20if%20you%27re%20using%20web)).  \n\n**Steps to reproduce**  \n- Create a new Angular project and install `@angular/youtube-player`.  \n- Add `<youtube-player [videoId]=\"'VIDEO_ID'\"></youtube-player>` to a component template.  \n- Serve the application and access the page on an iOS device via Safari.  \n- Observe the video player.  \n\n**Expected behavior**  \nThe YouTube video should load and play correctly on iOS, just as it does on desktop and Android platforms.  \n\n**Actual behavior**  \nOn iOS devices, the video area displays “Video player configuration error 153” and does not play the video.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Angular version: 19.2.14  \n- @angular/youtube-player version: 19.2.18  \n- Ionic Framework (@ionic/angular) version: 8.6.0  \n- Browser: Safari on iOS (multiple versions)  \n\n**Additional context**  \nThe issue persists even when using the `youtube-nocookie.com` domain for the embed. Reproduced across multiple iOS devices and networks.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nN/A – this bug occurs only in a Capacitor mobile app on iOS and cannot be reproduced via an online StackBlitz because it depends on the native iOS player. To reproduce, follow these steps in a Capacitor project:  \n1. Create a new Angular project and install `@angular/youtube-player`.  \n2. Wrap the app into a Capacitor iOS project (e.g., using `ionic build` and `npx cap add ios`).  \n3. In an Angular component template, add `<youtube-player [videoId]=\"'VIDEO_ID'\"></youtube-player>` with a valid video ID.  \n4. Run the app on an iOS device using `ionic capacitor run ios`.  \n5. The embedded player fails to load and shows “Video player configuration error 153”.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe embedded YouTube player should load and play the specified video normally on iOS just like it does on desktop and Android. Users should not see a “Video player configuration error 153”.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iOS devices using an Ionic/Capacitor mobile application, the embedded YouTube video fails to play and instead shows an error message: \"Video player configuration error 153\". The issue does not occur on desktop or Android devices.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.14\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.18\n- Browser(s): Safari on iOS (multiple versions)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): iOS 15/16","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Video player configuration error 153 on iOS for @angular/youtube-player\" (#32244)"},{"Id":"3581172570","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-03T09:52:14","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32243","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deferred content changes","State":"closed","Body":"Includes the following changes to deferred content:\r\n\r\n### refactor: avoid clearing too much content in deferred content\r\nThe deferred content directive currently calls `ViewContainerRef.clear` which may end up removing content that the directive doesn't actually own.

These changes add a shorthand through the `cdkConnectedOverlay` attribute for the cases where these values aren't expected to change.\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/overlay): simplify matching the overlay to the trigger width \r\nThe connected overlay directive allows users to control its width using the `cdkConnectedOverlayMatchWidth` input. This can be tricky when it needs to match another element like the trigger.\r\n\r\nSince this is a common for cases like dropdowns, these changes add the `cdkConnectedOverlayMatchWidth` input to simplify it.\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/overlay): hide native backdrop \r\nExplicitly hides the native backdrop from the CDK popover so it doesn't get rendered out.\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/overlay): make it easier to set default for overlay directive\r\nAdds the `CDK_CONNECTED_OVERLAY_DEFAULT_CONFIG` injection token to make it easier to configure the `CdkConnectedOverlay` directive.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32227","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Overlay fixes and improvements\" (#32227)"},{"Id":"3574358395","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-31T10:31:38","Actor":"benelliott","Number":"32228","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(form-field): Updating input value via `effect`+`FormControl` doesn't trigger label position calculation","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen updating a `FormControl` value inside a signal `effect`, the `MatFormField` floating label does not reposition under `OnPush` change detection unless `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` is called manually.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ujogbvgu?file=src%2Fexample%2Fform-field-overview-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

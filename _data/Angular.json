Get call stack when navigation is imperatively started with `new Error().stack`\n2. Add `callStack` property to the NavigationStart event\n3. Output it as part of `console.log(e)` in `withDebugTracing` factory\n\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDirectly call `console.trace()` when navigation is triggered / scheduled when tracing is enabled","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59782","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Router]: Include call stack while in debug mode\" (#59782)"},{"Id":"2818361516","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-29T14:19:30","Actor":"Shadowere","Number":"59779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs: fileReplacement: Inconsistencies between documentation and code/tests","State":"open","Body":"Command: Build\n\nAccording to the documentation and multiple issues opened, `fileReplacements` should only affect Typescript files.\n\nDocumentation: \n- https://angular.dev/tools/cli/environments#using-environment-specific-variables-in-your-app\n\nIssues:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16779#issuecomment-579183693\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25152#issuecomment-1536633787\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27638#issuecomment-2110251515\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40687#issue-800200041\n\nCode:\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/05f3680525461cadffaf80ff372d232ba919ec37/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/angular/compiler-plugin.ts#L508\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/05f3680525461cadffaf80ff372d232ba919ec37/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/tests/options/file-replacements_spec.ts#L14\n\nRelated PR: \n- JS Files: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28824\n- JSON Files: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28962\n\nWhat is the intended and expected result of using the `fileReplacements` option for JSON files?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59779","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Docs: fileReplacement: Inconsistencies between documentation and code/tests\" (#59779)"},{"Id":"2818079002","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-29T12:36:20","Actor":"SarthakT7","Number":"59778","RawContent":null,"Title":"event.stopPropagation does not work in a directive","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI'm trying to prevent the default action and stop event propagation in a custom Angular directive using `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` and `event.preventDefault()`.

It seems that the vite dev server follows the behavior of `AngularNodeAppEngine` and is blocking us from upgrading to v19.\n\nSomething odd is that `AngularNodeAppEngine` will render `/` as `test` but `/asdfasdf` as `404 not found`. `CommonEngine` renders `test` for both of these paths.\n\nSome debugging found that https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/249f9dc26caa4f3fe3cf9799588955cd27f51791/packages/angular/ssr/src/routes/ng-routes.ts#L606 is likely to blame. It flattens the route tree in a way that the nested wildcard route gets overridden by the non-nested one during the insert into the final route tree https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/249f9dc26caa4f3fe3cf9799588955cd27f51791/packages/angular/ssr/src/routes/ng-routes.ts#L722\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`AngularNodeAppEngine` - https://github.com/griest024/ng19-server-routing\n`CommonEngine` - https://github.com/griest024/ng19-server-routing/tree/common-engine\n\n1. run `npx ng b && npm run serve:ssr:19-dev-server-routes`\n2. navigate to `/asdfasdfasdf` or any other route that is not `/` or `/not-found`\n3.

The vulnerability allows websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n- **Package**: vite\n- **Affected Versions**: 6.0.0 - 6.0.8\n- **Severity**: Moderate\n- **Description**: Websites were able to send any requests to the development server and read the response in vite.\n- **Reference**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vg6x-rcgg-rjx6\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability potentially exposes sensitive information during development, which could be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n## Workaround Implemented\n\nTo address this issue, we've implemented the following workaround:\n\n1. Created a local copy of @angular/build in our project.\n2. Updated the vite version to 6.0.9 in the local copy's package.json.\n3. Modified our main package.json to use the local copy of @angular/build.\n\nThis approach allowed us to use a non-vulnerable version of vite without waiting for an official update to @angular/build.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n## Steps to Reproduce (for verification)\n\n1. Create a new Angular App via Angular/CLI\n2. Run `npm audit` to confirm \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nng version  \nNode.js version v23.5.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

When you update the data of the tree and a trackBy function is given to the tree, you can't interact with the tree anymore.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/fesfbplt?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-tree-nested-children-accessor-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. interact with the tree (not mandatory, but you see that it works)\n2. click on \"changeTree\" button\n3. try to open the tree again => this doesn't work\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTree should be updateable and interactive after an update. I would also expect that the open state is kept when only part of the tree is changed (in the example one subtree is removed, the other persists) and a trackby function is given.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nTree is closed and not interactive anymore.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18/19\n- CDK/Material: 18/19\n- Browser(s): all\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30403","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-tree): CDK Tree can't be opened when trackBy function is used after update of datasource\" (#30403)"},{"Id":"2814386843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-28T07:18:07","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"30400","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: updates buttons with icons a11y recommendations","State":"closed","Body":"Updates Buttons with icons documentation to recommend that any icon button be a minimum of 48x48 to be fully accessible and easily clickable on smaller screens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30400","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: updates buttons with icons a11y recommendations\" (#30400)"},{"Id":"2810848898","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-28T07:16:06","Actor":"Sepandard","Number":"30387","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(cdk/tree): fix broken examples in stackblitz","State":"closed","Body":"resolves #30159","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30387","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs-bug(cdk/tree): fix broken examples in stackblitz\" (#30387)"},{"Id":"2810440926","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T21:01:31","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"30386","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/checkbox): Optimize css selectors","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30386","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(material/checkbox): Optimize css selectors\" (#30386)"},{"Id":"2813890271","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-27T19:35:00","Actor":"clamli","Number":"30399","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatRadioButton): The `required` attribute is used on a radio button","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen used in a radio group, the `required` attribute is used on a radio button. All the radio buttons under the group have `required` attributes. This attribute should not be used on individual radio buttons, because that creates illogical meta-data, which may be confusing for assistive technology users. It's not the individual controls that are required, it's the group as a whole that must have one choice made from it.\n\nCode reference: https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/third_party/javascript/angular_components/src/material/radio/radio.ts;l=250-257;bpv=1;bpt=1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a radio button is used inside a radio group, if the group is required and does not have a default selection, then add `aria-required=\"true\"` to the wrapping element, not `aria-required/required` to the individual controls. We can leave it unchanged when a radio button is used outside a radio group, though I am unsure if that is a valid use case. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `required` attribute is applied to each radio button in a group.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

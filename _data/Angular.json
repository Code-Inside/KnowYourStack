Signal-based Decorator Extension\n\nEnable @ViewChild, @ContentChild, @ViewChildren, and @ContentChildren to return Signal-wrapped values with a { signal: true } option:\n```\n@ViewChild(MyComponent, { signal: true })\nmyComponent!: Signal<MyComponent | undefined>;\n\n@ContentChildren(MyDirective, { signal: true })\nmyDirectives!: Signal<QueryList<MyDirective>>;\n```\n# 2.

That appears to be the cause of the global `this` problems that [the angular CLI works around by monkey patching the window object to look like it's from an old version of the GJS runtime](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ba18bcc9ef00e1da31cabbb7845bbcdb5cfef565/packages/angular/build/src/builders/karma/polyfills/jasmine_global.js#L15-L17). It could cause other problems as well.\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29104 appears to have introduced both the bug and the GJS workaround.\n\njasmine-core 6.x will use `globalThis` to find the global object, which should do away with the need for the GJS workaround. But it will also [emit a warning if it's loaded as an ES module in the browser](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/commit/b881b0077d07239ed75ca150d38e3fd2060a64ee), since that's an unsupported and un-tested configuration that's already known to have caused problems.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Run `ng new` and accept the defaults. (I used @angular/cli 20.3.5.)\n2. In the created project, run `npm t`.\n3. Click the debug button in Karma.\n4. View source in the resulting tab.\n5. Look for the script tag that loads jasmine.js.\n\nIf you want to see the warning:\n\n1. Run `ng new` and select the zoneless option.

Zo in our example it would convert to return new URL('//something', 'http://localhost:4200') which according to the specs resolves to http://something\n\n**Attack scenario**\nAs Angular thinks (using the PlatformLocator or DOCUMENT token location.href) it is handling a domain that can be defined in the URL path. An attacker can let the server execute requests to a server of their choosing if relative requests are used, possibly injecting content.\n\nExecuting a request to http://localhost:4200//domain-from-attacker.com/some-path will in the above example execute a request to http://domain-from-attacker.com\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new Angular SSR project using ng new --ssr  and activate RenderMode.Server. See the example repo at https://github.com/meDavidNS/angular-ssr\n\n2. For illustration purpose inject the DOCUMENT token and the httpClient to make a relative request.\n```\n  protected readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient)\n  protected readonly doc = inject(DOCUMENT)\n  protected readonly loc = inject(PlatformLocation)\n  ngOnInit() {\n    console.log({\n      'HOSTNAME': this.loc.hostname,\n      'LOCATION': this.doc.location.href,\n    })\n    this.httpClient.get('assets/some.json').subscribe(console.log)\n  }\n\n```\n3. Request a page that starts the path with a double slash, like http://localhost:4200//something, this will trick Angular in thinking it is handling a request from http://something/ instead of http://localhost:4200. In the above example it will execute the http request to http://something/assets/some.json instead of http://localhost:4200/assets/some.json\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI:

Accordingly, the `coverageAll` option has been removed from the unit-test builders schema and its usage has been removed from the Karma and Vitest test runner implementations.\r\n- The browser provider mechanism has been updated. Vitest now uses provider-specific packages (e.g., `@vitest/browser-playwright`) instead of the general `@vitest/browser` package. The browser configuration setup has been made asynchronous and now dynamically loads the appropriate provider.\r\n- A workaround has been added to filter non-string values from the resolved coverage exclude patterns.

If using it and trying to install packages using `ng update` it just fails without any clear reason. What I would expect to happen is that `ng update` would list and download available packages while respecting the `npmMinimalAgeGate`, or at the very least the error could be made more descriptive. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSet package manager as yarn [v4.10.0](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/releases/tag/%40yarnpkg%2Fcli%2F4.10.0) or newer. Set `npmMinimalAgeGate` so that it is more than the age of the latest Angular version, for example I have `npmMinimalAgeGate: 10080` which is one week, and at the moment the newest Angular is [20.3.4](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/20.3.4) which is about 5 days old. Then try to run any update command like `ng update @angular/core`.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n$ ng update @angular/core\nThe installed Angular CLI version is outdated.\nInstalling a

In particular, the styling of those pages make it difficult to identify individual methods, and to understand which information to associate with which method. (Context: I just spent a fair amount of time debugging something related to `flexibleDimensions` on the CDKOverlay, and better/more easily intelligible docs would have definitely helped.)\n\nMy suggestion is to make simple tweaks to your styles that emphasize the boundaries between relevant units of functionality (e.g. method, class, etc), rather than using CSS borders to separate the key/label and value/description in bit of documentation about the unit of functionality. \n\nHere's an example of what I am talking about -- the first screenshot is the page now, and the second is what happens if you give the table for each method its own background color and border, and remove the inner borders. (3 CSS property change)\n\nAll of a sudden users can actually distinguish the individual methods, and you can also see that there is no documentation for `detach`. \n\nLots more could be done with spacing, color, and typography, but this is intended as either a quick win/low-hanging fruit suggestion, or more realistically, an issue to add to your evidence pile that the docs could use some redesign with an eye towards information hierarchy in a future release. \n\n<img width=\"987\" height=\"1204\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee3ad02-01e3-40e7-bd29-2b3b87715ced\" />\n---\n<img width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b3b2e3-fc05-44f3-927a-8fe411336d81\" />\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nall pages","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(all): Improvement suggestion: style docs to emphasize integrity of each method\" (#32060)"},{"Id":"3503838837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:59","Actor":"up81tr1222-cpu","Number":"32054","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nTimtonUploadEnhancements.jsx\n\n### Description\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"@/components/TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-6\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nnpx create-react-app timton-upload\ncd timton-upload\nnpm start\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"./TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32054","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#32054)"},{"Id":"3503837866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:54","Actor":"up81tr1222-cpu","Number":"32053","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nTimtonUploadEnhancements.jsx\n\n### Description\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"@/components/TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-6\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nnpx create-react-app timton-upload\ncd timton-upload\nnpm start\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nimport TimtonUploadEnhancements from \"./TimtonUploadEnhancements\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <TimtonUploadEnhancements />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32053","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#32053)"},{"Id":"3503769927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:34:36","Actor":"olfek","Number":"32052","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): Inline badges","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAdd support for inline badges like in:\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/badge/#background-colors\n\nThere is no inline option:\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/badge/api#MatBadgePosition\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32052","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(COMPONENT): Inline badges\" (#32052)"},{"Id":"3502811789","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T13:30:48","Actor":"aleoniz","Number":"32051","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material changes behaviour without a version change","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAngular Material has changed behaviour multiple times without updating its version in the application where it is used (not doing a single `npm install`, using exactly the same version). Specifically, using @angular/material@20.2.7, MatDrawer has changed from not having an animation to having it multiple times:\n\n- Did not have animation at some point before 06/10/2025 (don't remember the exact date, in this case with @angular/material@20.2.5)\n- Had an animation at 06/10/2025, 9:50 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.5 or @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did not have an animation at 08/10/2025, 11:48 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did have an animation at 10/10/2025, 12:19 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n\nI have also observed these changes in the examples in [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples), which have suffered the same changes in animations in the same dates, but I cannot assure they have not changed the @angular/material version used.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- Create an Angular application that uses MatDrawer, install dependencies just once, and check how the drawer changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates.\n- Or check how [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples) changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates (in some cases without a release).\n\nI know this is not easy to check if nobody else has noticed and it does not happen in the future (that would be fine). But if it happens again in the future, this will help resolve it.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material changes behaviour only with a version change\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAngular Material changes behaviour without a version change\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.3\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.7\n- Browser(s): Edge/Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32051","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material changes behaviour without a version change\" (#32051)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-10-15T03:30:02.8827194Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2174}

However, a longstanding bug caused the method to not fire when an *enabled* control was attached. This bug was fixed in v15.\r\n\r\nThis had a side effect: previously, it was possible to instantiate a reactive form control with `[attr.disabled]=true`, even though the the corresponding control was enabled in the model. (Note that the similar-looking property binding version `[disabled]=true` was always rejected, though.) This resulted in a mismatch between the model and the DOM. Now, because `setDisabledState` is always called, the value in the DOM will be immediately overwritten with the \"correct\" enabled value.\r\n\r\nUsers should instead disable the control directly in their model. (There are many ways to do this, such as using the `{value: 'foo', disabled: true}` constructor format, or immediately calling `FooControl.disable()` in `ngOnInit`.)\r\n\r\nIf this incompatibility is too breaking, you may also opt out using `FormsModule.withConfig` or `ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig` at the time you import it, via the `callSetDisabledState` option.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an exceptional case: radio buttons. Because Reactive Forms models the entire group of radio buttons as a single `FormControl`, there is no way to control the disabled state for individual radios, so they can no longer be configured as disabled.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we have special cased radio buttons to ignore their first call to `setDisabledState` when in `callSetDisabledState: 'always'` mode. This preserves the old behavior.\r\n\r\nRelated to #48350.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48864","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): Make radio buttons respect

However, when navigating from \"home\" to \"With custom elements\", which renders <hello-element> Angular Elements, a change detection is triggered for every <hello-element> instance (in this case, 50).\r\n\r\nThis has costly implications for performance as the # of change detections triggered in the parent components increase linearly with the # of child custom elements.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?

Maybe it is possible in angular with eslint to prohibit reassignment of @Input field values? For example make such fields readonly and have it checked by eslint? I've seen examples on stack overflow where people make @Required decorator, but this check will only work at runtime, and I would like it to work at typescript or eslint code analysis stage. For example in React it's easier, if I specify a property in a component in typescript type props and when calling that component I don't specify this property, typescript will warn me about it.\r\nAt the moment I often get a typescript error: \"Property 'property' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.\". To fix it you either have to make property: PropertyType | undefined; property!: PropertyType; property?: PropertyType. but it all looks very crusty and there is no single approach and you can't provoke a developer to write in the same style with eslint.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate some kind of decorator to make @Input mandatory or create some eslint rules to have a unified approach to make the property mandatory and no error: \"Property 'property' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.\".\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nFor example in React it's easier, if I specify a property in a component in typescript type props and when calling that component I don't specify this property, typescript will warn me about it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48835","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Required @Input\" (#48835)"},{"Id":"1556486969","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-25T11:27:48","Actor":"twittwer","Number":"48833","RawContent":null,"Title":"NonNullableFormControl is nullable for number inputs ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen defining a Form with the `NonNullableFormBuilder` all properties are typed as non-nullable as expected.

See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+import.meta.url+\r\n\r\nThis issue, which describes the problem well: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388 was closed bcause it's actually Webpack's fault and Webpack *used* to unconditionally rewrite `import.meta.url` to something useless in the absence of a loader.  But now we can stop Webpack from doing that, using the `parser.javascript.importMeta` option: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/15246\r\n\r\n... except that to do this in Angular requires a custom webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nSince we are not supposed to have webpack-specific configuration in the angular config, it would be nice if the default behaviour of Angular was non-broken.  Obviously it would have to be done while conserving the (arguably broken and inconsistent) policy of *sometimes* using loaders and *sometimes* not using them.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee

With this release, esbuild's serve mode will also respond to HTTP `HEAD` requests, which are just like HTTP `GET` requests except that the body of the response is omitted.\n\n-   Permit top-level await in dead code branches ([#&#8203;2853](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2853))\n\n    Adding top-level await to a file has a few consequences with esbuild:\n\n    1.  It causes esbuild to assume that the input module format is ESM, since top-level await is only syntactically valid in ESM. That prevents you from using `module` and `exports` for exports and also enables strict mode, which disables certain syntax and changes how function hoisting works (among other things).\n    2.  This will cause esbuild to fail the build if either top-level await isn't supported by your language target (e.g. it's not supported in ES2021) or if top-level await isn't supported by the chosen output format (e.g. it's not supported with CommonJS).\n    3.  Doing this will prevent you from using `require()` on this file or on any file that imports this file (even indirectly), since the `require()` function doesn't return a promise and so can't represent top-level await.\n\n    This release relaxes these rules slightly: rules 2 and 3 will now no longer apply when esbuild has identified the code branch as dead code, such as when it's behind an `if (false)` check. This should make it possible to use esbuild to convert code into different output formats that only uses top-level await conditionally. This release does not relax rule 1. Top-level await will still cause esbuild to unconditionally consider the input module format to be ESM, even when the top-level `await` is in a dead code branch. This is necessary because whether the input format is ESM or not affects the whole file, not just the dead code branch.\n\n-   Fix entry points where the entire file name is the extension ([#&#8203;2861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2861))\n\n    Previously if you passed esbuild an entry point where the file extension is the entire file name, esbuild would use the parent directory name to derive the name of the output file. For example, if you passed esbuild a file `./src/.ts` then the output name would be `src.js`. This bug happened because esbuild first strips the file extension to get `./src/` and then joins the path with the working directory to get the absolute path (e.g. `join(\"/working/dir\", \"./src/\")` gives `/working/dir/src`). However, the join operation also canonicalizes the path which strips the trailing `/`. Later esbuild uses the \"base name\" operation to extract the name of the output file. Since there is no trailing `/`, esbuild returns `\"src\"` as the base name instead of `\"\"`, which causes esbuild to incorrectly include the directory name in the output file name. This release fixes this bug by deferring the stripping of the file extension until after all path manipulations have been completed. So now the file `./src/.ts` will generate an output file named `.js`.\n\n-   Support replacing property access expressions with inject\n\n    At a high level, this change means the `inject` feature can now replace all of the same kinds of names as the `define` feature. So `inject` is basically now a more powerful version of `define`, instead of previously only being able to do some of the things that `define` could do.\n\n    Soem background is necessary to understand this change if you aren't already familiar with the `inject` feature. The `inject` feature lets you replace references to global variable with a shim. It works like this:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as the name of the global variable you intend to replace\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected.js\n    let processShim = { cwd: () => '/' }\n    export { processShim as process }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process` with the `processShim` variable, which will cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'`. This feature is sort of abusing the ESM export alias syntax to specify the mapping of global variables to shims. But esbuild works this way because using this syntax for that purpose is convenient and terse.\n\n    However, if you wanted to replace a property access expression, the process was more complicated and not as nice. You would have to:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as some random name\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n    4.  Use esbuild's `define` feature to map the property access expression to the random name you made in step 2\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected2.js --define:process.cwd=someRandomName`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected2.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as someRandomName }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which this time will not mess with other references to `process`, which might be desirable).\n\n    With this release, using the inject feature to replace a property access expression is now as simple as using it to replace an identifier. You can now use JavaScript's [\"arbitrary moduleÂ namespace identifierÂ names\"](https://togithub.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2154) feature to specify the property access expression directly using a string literal. For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected3.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected3.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as 'process.cwd' }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will now replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which will also not mess with other references to `process`).\n\n    In addition to inserting a shim for a global variable that doesn't exist, another use case is replacing references to static methods on global objects with cached versions to both minify them better and to make access to them potentially faster. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Injected file\n    let cachedMin = Math.min\n    let cachedMax = Math.max\n    export {\n      cachedMin as 'Math.min',\n      cachedMax as 'Math.max',\n    }\n\n    // Original input\n    function clampRGB(r, g, b) {\n      return {\n        r: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, r)),\n        g: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, g)),\n        b: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, b)),\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function clampRGB(a,t,m){return{r:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,a)),g:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,t)),b:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,m))}}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    var a=Math.min,t=Math.max;function clampRGB(h,M,m){return{r:t(0,a(1,h)),g:t(0,a(1,M)),b:t(0,a(1,m))}}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

just finished upgrading from angular 8 to 13, thanks for https://update.angular.io by the way,\r\n\r\nOur production setup for the rendering of the js files on the main page (where app-root is) was this and it used to work perfectly fine for the production release:\r\n\r\n    <environment exclude=\"Development\">\r\n        <script asp-src-include=\"~/runtime.*.js\"></script>\r\n        <script asp-src-include=\"~/polyfills-es5.*.js\" nomodule></script>\r\n        <script asp-src-include=\"~/polyfills.*.js\"></script>\r\n        <script asp-src-include=\"~/main.*.js\"></script>\r\n    </environment>\r\n\r\nBut now that we moved to 13, the angular UI was not starting at all on page load, so I realized that vendor.*.js was missing and it started working fine after adding it.\r\n\r\nHow is it that it was working fine without vendor.*.js in previous versions and on 13 it breaks? \r\n\r\n\r\ndependencies in v8:\r\n\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\":

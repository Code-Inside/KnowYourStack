In the simplest form I'm talking about this, where a `computed` is created inside a computation and the value is accessed. Importantly, notice that `outerComputed` doesn't directly have a dependency on `counter`.\r\n\r\n    const outerComputed = computed(() =>\r\n    {\r\n        const innerComputed = computed(() =>\r\n        {\r\n            return counter() % 5 == 0;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return innerComputed();\r\n    });\r\n\r\nDevelopers are most likely to encounter this without realizing if using something like [`selectSignal`](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/47ef048213635c5395591d350189a932e7503d75/modules/component-store/src/component-store.ts#L328) from ngrx:\r\n\r\n    const currentUserLastName = computed(() => store.selectSignal(s => s.users.filter(id => id == currentUserId()) )().lastName )\r\n\r\nIn the course of converting complex RxJS code (with nested `combineLatest` and `switchMap`) I have deliberately and unintentionally ended up with quite a lot of both of these in my codebase.\r\n\r\nWhile they should probably generally be discouraged, an explicit 'inner computed' like the one above has the extremely useful characteristic that it can reduce unnecessary churn of the 'outer computed'. Of course that's the beauty of signals and is exactly the same as if  `innerComputed` was declared outside - but that may not always be possible.\r\n\r\nIn my example above `innerComputed` produces a `true` value every fifth time `counter` is incremented (then goes back to `false`). Since `innerComputed` is a direct dependency of `outerComputed` it is tracked internally via `producerAccessed()`. So when it changes, `outerComputed` will re-execute its computation (and yes that does recreate the innerComputed).\r\n\r\nThe problem I've come across is that since nothing ever saves a 'strong ref' to `innerComputed` it gets garbage collected sometime after the computation for `outerComputed` is run. That breaks the graph dependency from `outerComputed` which then stops working (at the whim of the garbage collector!)\r\n\r\nConsequences / Observations: \r\n- If `outerComputed` had directly accessed `counter()` you would never notice a problem.\r\n- If `innerComputed` was returned by `outerComputed` you would never notice a problem.\r\n- If `outerComputed` has other dependencies, anytime one of those changes it will recreate and re-execute `innerComputed` so you perhaps would not notice a problem. This may be the hardest situation to debug!\r\n- Overall this can lead to some incredibly glitchy behavior!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nThe Stackblitz example is a more comprehensive example of the above, with the addition of a second signal `animal()` that is a direct dependency of `outerComputed`. That can be used to trigger `outerComputed` to re-run its calculation (and recreate `innerComputed`) if it becomes broken. \r\n\r\nHere is a log of running this example:\r\n\r\n- **Important:** Sometimes the garbage collector is much more aggressive than other times and it may take several attempts to observe this behavior.\r\n- I am using Chrome on Windows 11. The garbage collector may behave differently elsewhere.\r\n- Click 'Increment counter' 8 times and you should see something like the following:\r\n\r\n> 14:36:22.299 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=0\r\n> 14:36:22.299 main.ts:37 EFFECT: animal=cat\r\n> 14:36:22.299 main.ts:49 executing computation. iteration 0\r\n> 14:36:22.300 main.ts:61 EFFECT: outerComputed= {result: 'animal=cat, visible=true'}\r\n> 14:36:23.380 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=1\r\n> 14:36:23.380 main.ts:49 executing computation. iteration 1\r\n> 14:36:23.380 main.ts:61 EFFECT: outerComputed= {result: 'animal=cat, visible=false'}\r\n> 14:36:23.584 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=2\r\n> 14:36:23.871 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=3\r\n> 14:36:24.074 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=4\r\n> 14:36:24.280 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=5\r\n> 14:36:24.280 main.ts:49 executing computation. iteration 2\r\n> 14:36:24.280 main.ts:61 EFFECT: outerComputed= {result: 'animal=cat, visible=true'}\r\n> 14:36:24.504 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=6\r\n> 14:36:24.504 main.ts:49 executing computation. iteration 3\r\n> 14:36:24.504 main.ts:61 EFFECT: outerComputed= {result: 'animal=cat, visible=false'}\r\n> 14:36:24.729 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=7\r\n> 14:36:24.955 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=8\r\n\r\nYou can see the `effect` that logs `outerComputed()` was run only four times while `counter()` was incremented eight times.\r\n\r\nNow wait a few seconds. The `innerComputed` is garbage collected (sometimes this takes longer of course). If you continue incrementing the counter neither `innerComputed` nor `outerComputed` will run anymore.\r\n\r\n> 14:36:32.526 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=9\r\n> 14:36:33.241 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=10\r\n> 14:36:35.574 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=11\r\n> 14:36:36.001 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=12\r\n> 14:36:36.390 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=13\r\n> 14:36:36.821 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=14\r\n> 14:36:37.209 main.ts:32 EFFECT: counter=15\r\n\r\nYou can then toggle `animal` to restart things again.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/nested-computed-1\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.6\r\nNode: 18.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI really really don't want to lose the ability to create a `computed` inside another `computed`.

I was just reading about @angular/platform-webworker deprecated package and it's possiblities. It was an really awesome feature and developers were really happy about it. Why did Angular team decide to deprecate it?\r\n\r\nBootstraping Angular app in web worker could really improve mobile app development experience for developers who use for example: Ionic framework with Angular and Capacitor to bring their code to iOs and Android devices. Implementing some heavy computation code can be really challenging if you have complex logic and interface. Of course, you can use Web Workers and controll change detection with NgZone, but sometimes this is not enough so animations become janky, slow and it ruins UX on slower devices.\r\n\r\nIn my experience Angular is fast and extremely reliable, but I humbly think it can do better on mobile.

Though these are all technically correct as the DOCTYPE is case-insensitive, they lead to inconsistency in the codebase.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to standardize the DOCTYPE declaration across the codebase to <!DOCTYPE html>, as recommended by the official HTML Living Standard documentation by WHATWG (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype). It helps to present the codebase in a more standardized and aligned way with the industry best practices.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nAlthough this may seem like a minor detail, the standardization of these declarations adds to the overall quality and consistency of the project.

Effects are now scheduled via the microtask queue. This changes the tradeoffs:\r\n\r\n* effects are no longer limited by unidirectional data flow (easy dx)\r\n* effects registered in the Angular zone will trigger CD after they run (same as `Promise.resolve` really)\r\n* the public `effect()` type of effect probably isn't a good building block for our built-in control flow, and we'll need a new internal abstraction.\r\n\r\nAs `effect()` is in developer preview, changing the execution timing is not considered breaking even though it may impact current users.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51049","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): decouple effects from change detection\" (#51049)"},{"Id":"1805825215","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-15T02:26:33","Actor":"architect254","Number":"51048","RawContent":null,"Title":"First app lesson bug fix branch","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Unfortunately, the Sass compiler does not provided the importer file to import plugins. Previously to workaround this issue, all previously resolved stylesheets were tried as the importer path. This allowed the stylesheets to be resolved but it also could cause a potentially large increase in build time due to the amount of previous stylesheets that would need to be tried. To avoid the performance impact and to also provide more accurate information regarding the importer file, a lexer is now used to extract import information for a stylesheet and inject the importer file path into the specifier. This information is then extracted from the import specifier during the Sass resolution process and allows the underlying package resolution access to a viable location to resolve the package for all package managers. This information is currently limited to specifiers referencing the `@angular` and `@material` package scopes but a comprehensive pre-resolution process may be added in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25534","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(@angular-devkit/build-angular): inject Sass import/use directive importer

This would not occur with application code but is possible with library code that was built with TypeScript and shipped as CommonJS.\r\n\r\nAssuming the following TypeScript enum:\r\n```\r\n export enum ChangeDetectionStrategy {\r\n   OnPush = 0,\r\n   Default = 1,\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTypeScript 5.1 will emit an exported enum for CommonJS as follows:\r\n```\r\nexports.ChangeDetectionStrategy = void 0;\r\nvar ChangeDetectionStrategy;\r\n(function (ChangeDetectionStrategy) {\r\n    ChangeDetectionStrategy[ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"OnPush\"] = 0] = \"OnPush\";\r\n    ChangeDetectionStrategy[ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"Default\"] = 1] = \"Default\";\r\n})(ChangeDetectionStrategy || (exports.ChangeDetectionStrategy = ChangeDetectionStrategy = {}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build optimizer would previously transform this into:\r\n```\r\nexports.ChangeDetectionStrategy = void 0;\r\nvar ChangeDetectionStrategy = /*#__PURE__*/ (() => {\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy = ChangeDetectionStrategy || {};\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy[(ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"OnPush\"] = 5)] = \"OnPush\";\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy[(ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"Default\"] = 8)] = \"Default\";\r\n  return ChangeDetectionStrategy;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nBut this has a defect wherein the `exports` assignment is dropped. To rectify this situation, the build optimizer will now transform the code into:\r\n```\r\nexports.ChangeDetectionStrategy = void 0;\r\nvar ChangeDetectionStrategy = /*#__PURE__*/ (function (ChangeDetectionStrategy) {\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy[(ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"OnPush\"] = 0)] = \"OnPush\";\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy[(ChangeDetectionStrategy[\"Default\"] = 1)] = \"Default\";\r\n  return ChangeDetectionStrategy;\r\n})(ChangeDetectionStrategy || (exports.ChangeDetectionStrategy = ChangeDetectionStrategy = {}))\r\n```\r\nThis retains the `exports` assignment.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 5908ede3d676f2b87f68bc976bd741b7725ab1c3)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25540","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[16.1.x] fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly wrap CommonJS exported enums when optimizing\" (#25540)"},{"Id":"1804434183","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T08:16:34","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25542","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | optionalDependencies | patch | [`0.18.12` -> `0.18.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.18.12/0.18.13) |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.18.12` -> `0.18.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.18.12/0.18.13) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | dependencies | patch | [`0.18.12` -> `0.18.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.18.12/0.18.13) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.18.12` -> `0.18.13`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.18.12/0.18.13) |\n| [eslint](https://eslint.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.44.0` -> `8.45.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint/8.44.0/8.45.0) |\n| [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.25.0` -> `5.26.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/verdaccio/5.25.0/5.26.0) |\n| [vite](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite)) | dependencies | patch | [`4.4.3` -> `4.4.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/4.4.3/4.4.4) |\n| [vite](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.4.3` -> `4.4.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/4.4.3/4.4.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.18.13`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01813)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.12...v0.18.13)\n\n-   Add the `--drop-labels=` option ([#&#8203;2398](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2398))\n\n    If you want to conditionally disable some development-only code and have it not be present in the final production bundle, right now the most straightforward way of doing this is to use the `--define:` flag along with a specially-named global variable. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV && doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild --define:DEV=true`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --define:DEV=false`\n\n    One drawback of this approach is that the resulting code crashes if you don't provide a value for `DEV` with `--define:`. In practice this isn't that big of a problem, and there are also various ways to work around this.\n\n    However, another approach that avoids this drawback is to use JavaScript label statements instead. That's what the `--drop-labels=` flag implements. For example, consider the following code:\n\n    ```js\n    function main() {\n      DEV: doAnExpensiveCheck()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, you can now build this for development and production like this:\n\n    -   Development: `esbuild`\n    -   Production: `esbuild --drop-labels=DEV`\n\n    This means that code containing optional development-only checks can now be written such that it's safe to run without any additional configuration. The `--drop-labels=` flag takes comma-separated list of multiple label names to drop.\n\n-   Avoid causing `unhandledRejection` during shutdown ([#&#8203;3219](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3219))\n\n    All pending esbuild JavaScript API calls are supposed to fail if esbuild's underlying child process is unexpectedly terminated. This can happen if `SIGINT` is sent to the parent `node` process with Ctrl+C, for example. Previously doing this could also cause an unhandled promise rejection when esbuild attempted to communicate this failure to its own child process that no longer exists. This release now swallows this communication failure, which should prevent this internal unhandled promise rejection. This change means that you can now use esbuild's JavaScript API with a custom `SIGINT` handler that extends the lifetime of the `node` process without esbuild's internals causing an early exit due to an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n-   Update browser compatibility table scripts\n\n    The scripts that esbuild uses to compile its internal browser compatibility table have been overhauled. Briefly:\n\n    -   Converted from JavaScript to TypeScript\n    -   Fixed some bugs that resulted in small changes to the table\n    -   Added [`caniuse-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caniuse-lite) and [`@mdn/browser-compat-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;mdn/browser-compat-data) as new data sources (replacing manually-copied information)\n\n    This change means it's now much easier to keep esbuild's internal compatibility tables up to date. You can review the table changes here if you need to debug something about this change:\n\n    -   [JS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/d259b8fac717ee347c19bd8299f2c26d7c87481a...af1d35c372f78c14f364b63e819fd69548508f55#diff-1649eb68992c79753469f02c097de309adaf7231b45cc816c50bf751af400eb4)\n    -   [CSS table changes](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/commit/95feb2e09877597cb929469ce43811bdf11f50c1#diff-4e1c4f269e02c5ea31cbd5138d66751e32cf0e240524ee8a966ac756f0e3c3cd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.45.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.45.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.44.0...v8.45.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`cdd063c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/cdd063c388bbfe1781d7a864a832f03a2c1cc277) feat: Expose LegacyESLint in unsupported API ([#&#8203;17341](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17341)) (Nicholas C.

Here's a minimal example that triggers this edge case:\n\n    ```ts\n    (() => {\n      const enum E { a };\n      () => E.a\n    })\n    ```\n\n-   Allow a newline in the middle of TypeScript `export type` statement ([#&#8203;3225](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3225))\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly rejected the following valid TypeScript code:\n\n    ```ts\n    export type\n    { T };\n\n    export type\n    * as foo from 'bar';\n    ```\n\n    Code that uses a newline after `export type` is now allowed starting with this release.\n\n-   Fix cross-module inlining of string enums ([#&#8203;3210](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3210))\n\n    A refactoring typo in version 0.18.9 accidentally introduced a regression with cross-module inlining of string enums when combined with computed property accesses. This regression has been fixed.\n\n-   Rewrite `.js` to `.ts` inside packages with `exports` ([#&#8203;3201](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3201))\n\n    Packages with the `exports` field are supposed to disable node's path resolution behavior that allows you to import a file with a different extension than the one in the source code (for example, importing `foo/bar` to get `foo/bar.js`). And TypeScript has behavior where you can import a non-existent `.js` file and you will get the `.ts` file instead. Previously the presence of the `exports` field caused esbuild to disable all extension manipulation stuff which included both node's implicit file extension searching and TypeScript's file extension swapping. However, TypeScript appears to always apply file extension swapping even in this case. So with this release, esbuild will now rewrite `.js` to `.ts` even inside packages with `exports`.\n\n-   Fix a redirect edge case in esbuild's development server ([#&#8203;3208](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3208))\n\n    The development server canonicalizes directory URLs by adding a trailing slash. For example, visiting `/about` redirects to `/about/` if `/about/index.html` would be served. However, if the requested path begins with two slashes, then the redirect incorrectly turned into a protocol-relative URL. For example, visiting `//about` redirected to `//about/` which the browser turns into `http://about/`.

","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nAfter upgrading my angular 14 application to angular 16, the application will not longer run after building. The application runs in development mode just fine so I did not think it would be a problem after building.  I first tried building and deploying the application via the build server and it will not run. Then I tried building manually from vscode terminal and deploying the app manually and still does not run. The main.js blows up with uncaught reference error where a variable (different variable name each build) is not defined. Of course the code is obfuscated so hard to see what it is trying to do at this point.

But it doesn't work if you are using a backdrop. I built a [demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest%2Ftest.component.ts) to show the problem ([TestDialog01Component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest-dialog-01%2Ftest-dialog-01.component.ts)).  There is no way to get the current overlay of the dialog to dispose of it manually  (See #15840).\r\n\r\nI could find a workaround ([TestDialog02Component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hide-md-dialog-with-backdrop?file=src%2Ftest-dialog-02%2Ftest-dialog-02.component.ts)) by not using the built-in backdrop and creating a custom overlay.

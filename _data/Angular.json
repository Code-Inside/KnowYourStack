However, the input on the `group` method parameter named `controls` only has the constraint `{ [key: string]: any }` which is far more permissive but also far more error prone by end-users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt'd be extremely beneficial for one of the two following solutions, with my heavy preference being on the first:\r\n\r\n1. Update the input of `FormBuilder#group` to match that of `FormBuilder#_reduceControls` as described above.\r\n2. Explain in either the API documentation for `FormBuilder#group` that the `any` should actually be `{ [k: string]: T | ControlConfig<T> | FormControlState<T> | AbstractControl<T> }` but is left as `any` for backwards compatibility. Then after an appropriate amount of time and deprecation notices, apply suggestion 1.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOnly real alternative for people to figure out all possible values of `group` is to read every single part of the Reactive Forms page and hope that they covered it all. From my looking, never once was `ControlConfig<T>` mentioned in any documentation.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that part of the reason `ControlConfig<T>` is avoided in the documentation because it causes bug reports such as the one in #48631, but as the old adage goes, \"security through obscurity is not security.\"\r\n\r\nI know that pinging devs directly is probably discouraged, but I want to make sure that @dylhunn sees this since he appears to be the most active participant in the various issues I checked before opening this ticket.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54930","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Explicitly set ControlConfig as the parameter object's value type on FormBuilder#group\" (#54930)"},{"Id":"2193235929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-18T20:27:06","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54929","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): remove part aio infra","State":"open","Body":"Remove parts of the aio infra","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54929","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs-infra): remove part aio infra\" (#54929)"},{"Id":"2192964413","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-18T18:29:07","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54928","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): don't rely on aio_npm in adev","State":"open","Body":"Use @npm// instead of @aio_npm// in adev BUILD files","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54928","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(docs-infra): don't rely on aio_npm in adev\" (#54928)"},{"Id":"2192848383","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-18T18:16:52","Actor":"IceBjerg","Number":"54927","RawContent":null,"Title":"toSignal does not unsubscribe when combined with shareReplay","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nRecently I have found a strange error when using the built-in `toSignal` function from the `@angular/core/rxjs-interop` package. \r\n\r\nEverything works as expected unless the source observable has an additional `shareReplay` operator.\r\n\r\nWhen `shareReplay` is used, the signal stays subscribed to the observable, even after the component is destroyed.  \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-starter-3ew8m4\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWhen I use the `tap` operator on the source observable + `shareReplay` operator, I will still see the console logs even after the component is destroyed (if the observable is emitting new values).\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nWhen inspecting the provided stackblitz page, please open the console and look for logs.

Previously if and switch conditional would always use the first content as the insertion container. This strategy interfered with content projection that projects entire containers - as the consequence content for _all_ cases would end up in slot matched by the first container. This could be very surprising as described in angular#54840\r\n\r\nAfter the change each conditional content is projected into its own container. This means that content projection can match more than one container and result in correct display.\r\n\r\n### fix(compiler): capture all control flow branches for content projection in if blocks\r\nPreviously only the first branch of an `if` block was captured for content projection. This was done because of some planned refactors in the future. Since we've decided not to apply those refactors to conditionals, these changes update the compiler to capture each branch individually for content projection purposes.\r\n\r\n### fix(compiler): capture switch block cases for content projection \r\nCaptures the individual cases in `switch` blocks for content projection purposes.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): exit early when checking content projection \r\nUpdates the logic that detects if a node should be checked for control flow content projection to exit as soon as it detects a second root node, instead of counting the total and then checking if it's more than one.\r\n\r\nFixes #54840.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Project control flow branches individually\" (#54921)"},{"Id":"2189993076","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-18T07:17:39","Actor":"tijsmoree","Number":"54909","RawContent":null,"Title":"`withComponentInputBinding()` for route resolves","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI don't know if this fits in the Angular philosophy, but maybe it would be nice to make the route resolves available over the `input` signals like the parameters are when adding `withComponentInputBinding()` to the router config.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMake the resolves available in the `input` signals with `withComponentInputBinding()` enabled as well as the data it already does.

This will be relevant in the next commits where we'll match deferred blocks by their index.\r\n\r\nNote that the current map we have technically guarantees the insertion order in the spec, but the array is a bit more explicit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): widen type of resolver function\r\nUpdates the type of the resolver function to be any `Expression` since JIT may receive a function reference rather than a `ArrowFunctionExpr`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): add method for extracting function parameters\r\nUpdates the linker's AST host to add the ability to extract a function's parameters. This will be required for the next commits.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): introduce API for declaring asynchronous partial metadata\r\nAdds the `ɵɵngDeclareClassMetadataAsync` function that will be produced during partial compilation for component classes that have deferred dependencies. At runtime the dependencies will be resolved before setting the metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n### feat(compiler-cli): add partial compilation support for deferred blocks\r\nBuilds on top of the previous changes to add support for deferred blocks during partial compilation. To do this, the following changes had to be made:\r\n* The metadata passed into `ɵɵngDeclareComponent` has an additional field called `deferBlockDependencies` which has an array of the dependency loading functions for each defer block in the template. During linking, the dependency functions are loaded by matching their template index to the index in the `deferBlockDependencies` array.\r\n* There's a new `ɵɵngDeclareClassMetadataAsync` function that is created for components that have deferred dependencies. It gets transpiled to `setClassMetadataAsync` and works in the same way by capturing a dependency loading function and setting the metadata after the dependencies are resolved. It also has some extra fields for capturing the version which are standard in linker-generated code.\r\n* Deferred import statements are now stripped in partial compilation mode, similar to full compilation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54908","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support deferred blocks in partial compilation\" (#54908)"},{"Id":"2189609797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-15T23:31:45","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"54907","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): make `any` injector scope configurable","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates an internal logic to treat `any` as any other scope.

The fact that signal value unwrapping is function-based breaks Typescript's nullability checking in a fairly major way, especially in templates.  This leads to either duplicate nullability checks, use of !'s to quell the compiler, or people switching off null checks altogether.\r\n\r\nIt's a very poor developer experience.\r\n\r\nThat issue has been open for more than a year with no response I can find from the Angular team.  Some engagement would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, PLEASE!\r\n\r\n### Plagiarised original issue:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of signals uses a function to access the value, and TypeScript has issues with type guards in that case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst count = signal(null as null | number);\r\nconst total: number = count() !== null ? count() : 0;\r\n// Error: Type `number | null` is not assignable to type `number`\r\n```\r\nThis can be workaround by storing the value in a temporary variable or with an explicit cast, but this could be a bit cumbersome, as I imagine the same would happen with ngIf in templates:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst count = signal(null as null | number);\r\nconst value = count();\r\nconst total: number = value !== null ? value : 0;\r\n// Works\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My own additional colour\r\n```typescript\r\nsomeSignal = signal<number | undefined>(undefined);\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.someSignal.set(1)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal() !== undefined) {\r\n  {{someSignal() + 1}}\r\n}\r\n<!-- Object is possibly 'undefined' -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal(); as someSignal) {\r\n  @if (someSignal !== undefined) {\r\n    {{someSignal + 1}}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<!-- Works, but this is a horrible developer experience -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (someSignal()) {\r\n  {{someSignal()! + 1}}\r\n}\r\n<!-- Techincally works, but makes nullability checking useless -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThis entire issue would be moot were Signals to use getters rather than functions to unwrap the inner value.

This was silently compiled incorrectly in esbuild 0.19.7 and below, and was an error from esbuild 0.19.8 to esbuild 0.20.1. Code such as the following should now work correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    const log = (x: any, y: string) => console.log(y)\n    abstract class Foo { @&#8203;log abstract foo: string }\n    new class extends Foo { foo = '' }\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    __decorateClass([\n      log\n    ], Foo.prototype, \"foo\", 2);\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n    ```\n\n-   JSON loader now preserves `__proto__` properties ([#&#8203;3700](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3700))\n\n    Copying JSON source code into a JavaScript file will change its meaning if a JSON object contains the `__proto__` key. A literal `__proto__` property in a JavaScript object literal sets the prototype of the object instead of adding a property named `__proto__`, while a literal `__proto__` property in a JSON object literal just adds a property named `__proto__`. With this release, esbuild will now work around this problem by converting JSON to JavaScript with a computed property key in this case:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from 'data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}'\n    if (Object.getPrototypeOf(data)?.fail) throw 'fail'\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { __proto__: { fail: true } };\n\n      // entry.js\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { [\"__proto__\"]: { fail: true } };\n\n      // example.mjs\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Improve dead code removal of `switch` statements ([#&#8203;3659](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3659))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now remove `switch` statements in branches when minifying if they are known to never be evaluated:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if (true) foo(); else switch (bar) { case 1: baz(); break }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    if(1)foo();else switch(bar){case 1:}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    foo();\n    ```\n\n-   Empty enums should behave like an object literal ([#&#8203;3657](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3657))\n\n    TypeScript allows you to create an empty enum and add properties to it at run time. While people usually use an empty object literal for this instead of a TypeScript enum, esbuild's enum transform didn't anticipate this use case and generated `undefined` instead of `{}` for an empty enum. With this release, you can now use an empty enum to generate an empty object literal.\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    enum Foo {}\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n    })(Foo || {});\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n      return Foo2;\n    })(Foo || {});\n    ```\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play edge case with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3698](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3698))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map failed to work when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3682](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3682))\n\n    Version 0.20.0 of esbuild changed how the esbuild child process is run in esbuild's API for Deno. Previously it used `Deno.run` but that API is being removed in favor of `Deno.Command`. As part of this change, esbuild is now calling the new `unref` function on esbuild's long-lived child process, which is supposed to allow Deno to exit when your code has finished running even though the child process is still around (previously you had to explicitly call esbuild's `stop()` function to terminate the child process for Deno to be able to exit).\n\n    However, this introduced a problem for Deno's testing API which now fails some tests that use esbuild with `error: Promise resolution is still pending but the event loop has already resolved`. It's unclear to me why this is happening. The call to `unref` was recommended by someone on the Deno core team, and calling Node's equivalent `unref` API has been working fine for esbuild in Node for a long time. It could be that I'm using it incorrectly, or that there's some reference counting and/or garbage collection bug in Deno's internals, or that Deno's `unref` just works differently than Node's `unref`. In any case, it's not good for Deno tests that use esbuild to be failing.\n\n    In this release, I am removing the call to `unref` to fix this issue. This means that you will now have to call esbuild's `stop()` function to allow Deno to exit, just like you did before esbuild version 0.20.0 when this regression was introduced.\n\n    Note: This regression wasn't caught earlier because Deno doesn't seem to fail tests that have outstanding `setTimeout` calls, which esbuild's test harness was using to enforce a maximum test runtime. Adding a `setTimeout` was allowing esbuild's Deno tests to succeed. So this regression doesn't necessarily apply to all people using tests in Deno.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.29.2`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5292)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.29.1...v5.29.2)\n\n-   Make sure 'computed_props' creates string keys\n-   Take into account the evaluated size when inlining\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.9.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   feat: add new dispatch compose by [@&#8203;metcoder95](https://togithub.com/metcoder95) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826)\n-   ci: add macos-latest to test-matrix by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952)\n-   types: align RequestInit.body type with lib.dom.ts by [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   ci: pin versions of github actions by [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n-   fetch: improve output for FormData, Response, Request by [@&#8203;mertcanaltin](https://togithub.com/mertcanaltin) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955)\n-   perf: optimize collectASequenceOfBytes by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

based in the projected content.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n```bottomSheetRef``` returned by the `open()` method gives access to `containerInstance` property.\r\n\r\nConvert `elementRef` of `containerInstance` from private to public property. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No alternatives

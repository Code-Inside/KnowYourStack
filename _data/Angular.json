When generating the scope for listener instructions, we expose all the `@let` declarations in the same view ([see](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler/src/template/pipeline/src/phases/generate_variables.ts#L293)) which leads us to generate `ɵɵrestoreView` and `ɵɵresetView` calls, however if the `@let` reference isn't used within the listener, the variable optimization phase only removes the variable that reads it and not the `ɵɵrestoreView`/`ɵɵresetView` calls.\n\nFor example, if we take the following template:\n\n```html\n@let unused = 1;\n<button (click)=\"noop()\"></button>\n```\n\nIt produces the following code before optimization:\n\n```js\nif (rf & 1) {\n  const _r1 = ɵɵgetCurrentView();\n  ɵɵdeclareLet(0);\n  ɵɵdomElementStart(1, \"button\", 0);\n  ɵɵdomListener(\n    \"click\",\n    function TestComp_Template_button_click_1_listener() {\n      const ctx_r1 = ɵɵrestoreView(_r1);\n      const unused_r3 = ɵɵreadContextLet(0);\n      return ɵɵresetView(ctx.noop());\n    }\n  );\n  ɵɵdomElementEnd();\n}\nif (rf & 2) {\n  const unused_r4 = ɵɵstoreLet(1);\n}\n```\n\nWhich becomes the following after optimization:\n\n```js\nif (rf & 1) {\n  const _r1 = ɵɵgetCurrentView();\n  ɵɵdomElementStart(0, \"button\", 0);\n  ɵɵdomListener(\n    \"click\",\n    function TestComp_Template_button_click_0_listener() {\n      ɵɵrestoreView(_r1);\n      return ɵɵresetView(ctx.noop());\n    }\n  );\n  ɵɵdomElementEnd();\n}\nif (rf & 2) {\n  1;\n}\n```\n\nThe `ɵɵrestoreView` and `ɵɵresetView` calls aren't necessary and should be removed, because there aren't any reads of the unused `@let`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66286","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Template pipeline leaves behind unnecessary restore/reset view calls in the presence of `@let`\" (#66286)"},{"Id":"3771966076","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-31T04:37:48","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"66285","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Incorrect Highlighting in Content Queries Example","State":"open","Body":"Fixes: #66284\r\n\r\nCurrent: \r\n<img width=\"797\" height=\"501\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a5fc2c-9b0b-4618-8776-ae30125fc9c0\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"797\" height=\"501\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a568956-bf18-4703-9484-f3438c4134f6\" />\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66285","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: Incorrect Highlighting in Content Queries Example\" (#66285)"},{"Id":"3771799276","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-31T02:14:09","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"66284","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect Highlighting in Content Queries Example","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nIn the example, the highlight should be on the next line.

The options are:\r\n- 'always': Enforces a trailing slash on all URLs.\r\n- 'never': Removes trailing slashes from all URLs (default).\r\n- 'preserve': Respects the presence or absence of a trailing slash as defined in the UrlTree.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit updates the `defaultUrlMatcher` to optionally consume a single trailing empty path segment if the route otherwise matches. This ensures that routes with `pathMatch: 'full'` can correctly match URLs with trailing slashes (e.g., `/a/` matching `{path: 'a', pathMatch: 'full'}`), resolving a long-standing inconsistency where such routes would fail despite `pathMatch: 'prefix'` variants (with empty children) succeeding.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered & Design Rationale:**\r\n\r\n*  **`UrlTree.hasTrailingSlash` Property:** We initially explored adding a explicit boolean property to `UrlTree`. However, this would have required a significant public API change and breaking updates to custom `UrlSerializer` implementations to ensure the state was preserved. It also complicated the mental model of the `UrlTree` as a direct representation of the URL structure. We settled on representing trailing slashes as a trailing empty `UrlSegment`, which leverages the existing structure and serialization logic without API expansion.\r\n\r\n    **Why we chose the current approach:**\r\n    We decided on a \"Permissive Matcher, Strict Serializer/Location\" pattern.\r\n    -   The **Matcher** is permissive: it allows consuming a trailing empty segment if it's the *only* thing left, treating it effectively as optional for `pathMatch: 'full'`. This aligns logic with how `pathMatch: 'prefix'` matches empty children.\r\n    -   The **Serializer/Location** are strict: The `trailingSlash` configuration is verified at the boundaries (serialization and location normalization). If `trailingSlash: 'never'` is set, the slash is stripped *before* matching ever occurs. If matching sees a slash, it implies the configuration allowed it (or we are in a permissive mode), so the matcher should handle it gracefully.\r\n\r\nfixes #16051\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66276","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): add trailingSlash config option\" (#66276)"},{"Id":"3767941638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T22:54:36","Actor":"Sepandard","Number":"66273","RawContent":null,"Title":"doc(essentials): clarify prerequisites, remove misleading decorator","State":"closed","Body":"resolves #65739\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The reason is that pure functions are set up to [write to the binding root plus an offset](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/pure_function.ts#L52), however the offsets overlap when the parent and child class host binding functions execute. This can lead to \"changed after checked\" errors.\n\nIt can be reproduced with the following tests:\n\n```ts\nit('should not throw', () => {\n  @Directive({\n    host: {\n      '[attr.parent]': '[\"parent\"][0]',\n    },\n  })\n  class ParentDir {}\n\n  @Directive({\n    host: {\n      '[attr.child]': '[\"child\"][0]',\n    },\n    selector: 'some-dir',\n  })\n  class SomeDir extends ParentDir {}\n\n  @Component({\n    template: '<some-dir/>',\n    imports: [SomeDir],\n  })\n  class App {}\n\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n  fixture.detectChanges();\n});\n```\n\nThis produces two `pureFunction(2, ...)` instructions that both try to write into the same offset which eventually throw an error.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inherited host bindings can write into wrong variable offset\" (#66263)"},{"Id":"3764169536","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-27T00:37:05","Actor":"mokeev1995","Number":"66262","RawContent":null,"Title":"TSX/JSX compilation support","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThere are libraries like @bubblydoo/angular-react that help to use multiple frameworks (React + Angular) at the same time.\n\nThe core developers of this library discovered that, starting from some point, the builder has been broken for TSX/JSX files (at least since @angular/compiler-cli@13). They applied a patch for their own needs using Yarn. It works, but it has to be maintained separately for each framework version.\n\nSo, I assume it might not be very hard to fix, since the issue has already been identified by the patch authors (see the patch [here](https://github.com/bubblydoo/angular-react/blob/main/.yarn/patches/%40angular-compiler-cli-npm-14.3.0-340f59f610.patch), and the source file that needs to be modified is located [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/file_system/src/util.ts)).\n\nI can provide a PR with this fix if this is an acceptable way to address this kind of issue.\n\nHere is an example of the issue (after upgrading to ng@15 and removing the Yarn patch; the issue persists even after upgrading to the latest Angular version):\n\n<img width=\"1277\" height=\"522\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3548f74e-e110-4d90-8c4c-3768d45ca340\" />\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/bubblydoo/angular-react\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError [RollupError]: Could not resolve \"../react-wrapper/react-wrapper.component.tsx\" from \"../../dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/react-to-template-ref.component.mjs\"\n    at error (/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/node_modules/rollup/dist/shared/rollup.js:353:30)\n    at ModuleLoader.handleInvalidResolvedId (/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/node_modules/rollup/dist/shared/rollup.js:26015:24)\n    at /Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/node_modules/rollup/dist/shared/rollup.js:25977:26 {\n  code: 'UNRESOLVED_IMPORT',\n  exporter: '../react-wrapper/react-wrapper.component.tsx',\n  id: '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/react-to-template-ref.component.mjs',\n  watchFiles: [\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/bubblydoo-angular-react.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/public-api.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/angular-react.service.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/angular-react.module.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/react-wrapper/react-wrapper.component.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/angular-context/angular-context.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/angular-wrapper/angular-wrapper.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/angular-wrapper-with-module/angular-wrapper-with-module.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/use-injected/use-injected.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/use-observable/use-observable.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/angular-template-outlet.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/react-to-template-ref.component.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/template-outlet.component.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/use-to-angular-template-ref.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/templates/is-top-level-react-token.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/injectable-react-context/react-context-token.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/injectable-react-context/use-injectable-react-context.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/use-in-tree-create-root/in-tree-create-root-token.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/use-in-tree-create-root/use-in-tree-create-root.mjs',\n    '/Users/mokeev1995/git/angular-react-orig/dist/angular-react/esm2020/lib/nest-wrappers/nest-wrappers.mjs'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.11\nNode: 22.14.0 (Unsupported)\nPackage Manager: yarn 3.4.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 15.2.10\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.11\n@angular/cli                    15.2.11\n@schematics/angular             15.2.11\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\nrxjs                            7.5.7\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66262","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TSX/JSX compilation support\" (#66262)"},{"Id":"3764036232","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-26T21:35:18","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"66261","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): LoadComponent along with loadChildren","State":"open","Body":"I've updated the documentation to simply include a few route combinations.

We then open the page using `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` and see the following in the browser console: \n\n```\nAngular is running in development mode.\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\nclient:755 WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:755\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:759Understand this error\nclient:765 [vite] failed to connect to websocket.\nyour current setup:\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[HTTP]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[WebSocket (failing)]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\nCheck out your Vite / network configuration and https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr .\n```\n\nWe also noticed that when we go to `https://localhost:4201/` and accept the certificate issue there, going back to `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` would allow the websocket connection using its fallback attempted connection on localhost. See the following from the browser console:\n\n```\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\ndebug_node.mjs:18311 Angular is running in development mode.\nclient:760 [vite] Direct websocket connection fallback. Check out https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr to remove the previous connection error.\n```\n\nWe also have one other project we are updating to Angular 20 where we use `localhost` instead of `portal.domain.dev`. This issue is not present there.\n\nWe have spent quite a bit of time to try and fix this. But we traced this back to the HMR host configuration, which to our knowledge is not configurable through the CLI and is fully encapsulated, preventing us from exerting influence on this part of Vite. To bypass this we have developed a patch which fixed this issue and allows us to configure `server.hmr.host`. We are considering using this patch because this does fix our issue when we configure it to be `portal.domain.dev`. You will find the patch below: \n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\nindex 271dc0c..fd35e0f 100755\n--- a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\n@@ -714,6 +714,10 @@ async function setupServer(serverOptions, outputFiles, assets, preserveSymlinks,\n                 cert: await (0, promises_1.readFile)(serverOptions.sslCert),\n                 key: await (0, promises_1.readFile)(serverOptions.sslKey),\n             };\n+\n+            configuration.server.hmr = {\n+                host: process.env.VITE_HMR_HOST || 'portal.domain.dev',\n+            };\n         }\n         else {\n             const { default: basicSslPlugin } = await Promise.resolve().then(() => __importStar(require('@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl')));\n```\n\nWe would like Angular to expose some way to configure the `server.hmr.host`, either via a CLI flag or through the `angular.json`. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n_Please see the description._\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.13\nNode: 22.21.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.4\nOS: linux arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.15\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.13\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.13\n@angular/build               20.3.13\n@angular/cli                 20.3.13\n@angular/google-maps         20.2.14\n@schematics/angular          20.3.13\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite HMR websocket connection fails\" (#32204)"},{"Id":"3756060604","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T15:08:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32192","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (21.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi41OC4xIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuNTguMSIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6IjIxLjAueCIsImxhYmVscyI6WyJhY3Rpb246IG1lcmdlIiwiYXJlYTogYnVpbGQgJiBjaSIsInRhcmdldDogYXV0b21hdGlvbiJdfQ==-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance (21.0.x)\" (#32192)"},{"Id":"3767634105","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T15:05:38","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32203","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): export compiler plugin and stylesheet options types","State":"open","Body":"Exposes `CompilerPluginOptions` and `BundleStylesheetOptions` via the private API.

This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3.

The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#&#8203;10334](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable\n\n  This includes support for workspace monorepos - all `node_modules` directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Throw an error if the value of the `tokenHelper` or `<url>:tokenHelper` setting contains an environment variable.\n- Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` settings [#&#8203;10376](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10376).\n- Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories [#&#8203;10384](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10384)\n- Fixed a bug ([#&#8203;9759](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9759)) where `pnpm add` would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to its exact version.\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.2): pnpm 10.26.2\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.26.1...v10.26.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Improve error message when a package version exists but does not meet the `minimumReleaseAge` constraint. The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#&#8203;10334](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

[`v0.27.2`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0272)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.27.1...v0.27.2)\n\n- Allow import path specifiers starting with `#/` ([#&#8203;4361](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4361))\n\n  Previously the specification for `package.json` disallowed import path specifiers starting with `#/`, but this restriction [has recently been relaxed](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/60864) and support for it is being added across the JavaScript ecosystem. One use case is using it for a wildcard pattern such as mapping `#/*` to `./src/*` (previously you had to use another character such as `#_*` instead, which was more confusing). There is some more context in [nodejs/node#49182](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49182).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;hybrist](https://redirect.github.com/hybrist).\n\n- Automatically add the `-webkit-mask` prefix ([#&#8203;4357](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4357), [#&#8203;4358](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4358))\n\n  This release automatically adds the `-webkit-` vendor prefix for the [`mask`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/mask) CSS shorthand property:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  main {\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --target=chrome110) */\n  main {\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n  }\n\n  /* New output (with --target=chrome110) */\n  main {\n    -webkit-mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;BPJEnnova](https://redirect.github.com/BPJEnnova).\n\n- Additional minification of `switch` statements ([#&#8203;4176](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4176), [#&#8203;4359](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4359))\n\n  This release contains additional minification patterns for reducing `switch` statements. Here is an example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  switch (x) {\n    case 0:\n      foo()\n      break\n    case 1:\n    default:\n      bar()\n  }\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  switch(x){case 0:foo();break;case 1:default:bar()}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  x===0?foo():bar();\n  ```\n\n- Forbid `using` declarations inside `switch` clauses ([#&#8203;4323](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4323))\n\n  This is a rare change to remove something that was previously possible. The [Explicit Resource Management](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) proposal introduced `using` declarations. These were previously allowed inside `case` and `default` clauses in `switch` statements. This had well-defined semantics and was already widely implemented (by V8, SpiderMonkey, TypeScript, esbuild, and others). However, it was considered to be too confusing because of how scope works in switch statements, so it has been removed from the specification. This edge case will now be a syntax error. See [tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management#215](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management/issues/215) and [rbuckton/ecma262#14](https://redirect.github.com/rbuckton/ecma262/pull/14) for details.\n\n  Here is an example of code that is no longer allowed:\n\n  ```js\n  switch (mode) {\n    case 'read':\n      using readLock = db.read()\n      return readAll(readLock)\n\n    case 'write':\n      using writeLock = db.write()\n      return writeAll(writeLock)\n  }\n  ```\n\n  That code will now have to be modified to look like this instead (note the additional `{` and `}` block statements around each case body):\n\n  ```js\n  switch (mode) {\n    case 'read': {\n      using readLock = db.read()\n      return readAll(readLock)\n    }\n    case 'write': {\n      using writeLock = db.write()\n      return writeAll(writeLock)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This is not being released in one of esbuild's breaking change releases since this feature hasn't been finalized yet, and esbuild always tracks the current state of the specification (so esbuild's previous behavior was arguably incorrect).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jsdom/jsdom (jsdom)</summary>\n\n### [`v27.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2740)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/27.3.0...27.4.0)\n\n- Added `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`.\n- Improved decoding of HTML bytes by using the new [`@exodus/bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;exodus/bytes) package; it is now much more correct. (ChALkeR)\n- Improved decoding of XML bytes to use UTF-8 more often, instead of sniffing for `<meta charset>` or using the parent frame's encoding.\n- Fixed a memory leak when `Range`s were used and

file.\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [RouterOutlet],\n  templateUrl: './app.html',\n  styleUrl: './app.ts'\n})\n```\n\nAnd I got a bunch of TypeScript compilation errors to do with rxjs:\n```\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"./internal/operators/skipUntil\" [plugin angular-compiler]\n\n    node_modules/rxjs/dist/esm5/index.js:140:26:\n      140 │ export { skipUntil } from

Generation","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, when creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI (ng new), the CLI generates a fixed default folder structure. While this structure works well for simple applications, most real-world and enterprise Angular projects require a custom architecture from the beginning.\n\nIn practice, developers and teams often need to manually restructure the generated project to follow their preferred architecture, such as separating folders for auth, features, shared, and core. This manual setup process is repetitive, time-consuming, and can lead to inconsistencies across projects and teams.\n\nI would like to propose a feature (or supporting tool) that allows developers to define their Angular project architecture before project generation.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProvide a simple and interactive way to generate an Angular project with a custom structure instead of the default Angular CLI layout.\n\nThe proposed flow would be:\n\nAsk the developer which Angular version they want to use when creating the project\n\nAsk whether the project should be module-based or standalone (component-based)\n\nAllow the developer to define their own main folder structure\n\nFor example, a developer may want the following top-level folders:\n\ncore\n\nshared\n\nfeatures\n\nlayout\n\nThe developer should be able to fully manage and customize these folders, including creating subfolders inside them based on project needs.\n\nAfter defining the configuration and folder structure, the tool should generate the Angular project automatically. When the developer runs a single command or clicks a generate button, the Angular project should be created according to the selected version, architecture type, and custom folder structure.\n\nThis approach would give developers full flexibility, reduce manual setup work, and help maintain a consistent project architecture from the beginning.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32187","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Custom Angular Project Structure Generation\" (#32187)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3770595035","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-30T15:49:16","Actor":"MazzyK","Number":"32607","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update blog link","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32607","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update blog link\" (#32607)"},{"Id":"3769364517","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-30T07:43:49","Actor":"Mr-KRAMA","Number":"32606","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix/aria grid cdk table ng0201","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes an issue where ngGridCell throws an NG0201 error when used inside a CDK table.

`NG3004` in library builds","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen building an Angular **library** (using partial compilation mode / ng-packagr), binding to the `preserveContent` input on `AccordionPanel` causes the following error:\n\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe `AccordionPanel` directive uses `hostDirectives` to expose `DeferredContentAware`:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 53)\nstatic ɵdir: ɵɵDirectiveDeclaration<AccordionPanel, \"[ngAccordionPanel]\", ...,\n  [{ directive: typeof DeferredContentAware; inputs: { \"preserveContent\": \"preserveContent\"; }; outputs: {}; }]>;\n```\n\nThe `preserveContent` input **IS exposed** via the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping, making it appear as a valid input on `AccordionPanel`. However, when Angular's AOT compiler type-checks a template binding like `[preserveContent]=\"true\"`, it needs to import the `DeferredContentAware` type to verify the binding.\n\nThe problem is that `DeferredContentAware` is imported from an internal module:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 4)\nimport { DeferredContentAware } from '@angular/aria/_deferred-content-chunk.js';\n```\n\nThe underscore prefix (`_`) indicates this is a private/internal module, and `DeferredContentAware` is **not re-exported** from `@angular/aria/accordion`.\n\n### The Inconsistency\n\n1. `AccordionPanel` **exposes** `preserveContent` as a usable input via `hostDirectives`\n2. But the **type** required to use this input (`DeferredContentAware`) is **not exported**\n3. This works in JIT mode (development) but **fails in AOT/partial compilation** (library builds)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: Unable to reproduce in StackBlitz as this requires a library build with ng-packagr (partial compilation mode). StackBlitz runs in JIT mode where the issue doesn't manifest.\n\n1. Create an Angular library project using ng-packagr\n2. Create a component that uses `AccordionPanel` with `preserveContent` binding:\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-accordion',\n  imports: [AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent],\n  template: `\n    <div ngAccordionGroup>\n      <button ngAccordionTrigger [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\">Toggle</button>\n      <div ngAccordionPanel\n           [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\"\n           [preserveContent]=\"true\">  <!-- THIS CAUSES NG3004 -->\n        <ng-template ngAccordionContent>\n          <p>Panel content</p>\n        </ng-template>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyAccordionComponent {}\n```\n\n3. Build the library:\n```bash\nng build my-library\n# or\nnpx ng-packagr -p ng-package.json\n```\n\n4. Observe the error:\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOne of the following:\n\n### Option A: Export `DeferredContentAware` (Preferred)\n\nExport `DeferredContentAware` from `@angular/aria/accordion` so that consumers can use the `preserveContent` input that is already exposed via `hostDirectives`:\n\n```typescript\n// @angular/aria/accordion/index.ts\nexport { DeferredContentAware } from '../_deferred-content-chunk';\nexport { AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent } from './accordion';\n```\n\n### Option B: Document the limitation\n\nIf `preserveContent` is intentionally internal, remove it from the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping or document that it cannot be used in library builds.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The `preserveContent` input appears to be available (TypeScript/IDE shows it as a valid input)\n- Development mode (JIT) works fine\n- Library builds (AOT partial compilation) fail with `NG3004`\n- There is no workaround - attribute binding `[attr.preserveContent]=\"true\"` bypasses the error but doesn't actually set the signal input value\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 21.0.4\nNode: 24.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.6.2\nOS: win32 arm64\n\nAngular: 21.0.6\n@angular/aria: 21.0.5\n@angular/cdk: 21.0.5\n\nBrowser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari (not browser-specific)\nOperating System: Windows 11 ARM64 (also reproducible on other platforms)\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Why `preserveContent` is needed\n\nWithout `preserveContent=true`, there can be content duplication issues when combining:\n- `ngAccordionContent` (deferred content)\n- `NgTemplateOutlet` (for user-provided content templates)\n- Native Angular animations (`animate.enter`/`animate.leave`)\n\nWhen the panel visibility changes, the deferred content system destroys/recreates views, which can conflict with animation lifecycle and `NgTemplateOutlet`, resulting in duplicate content appearing in the DOM.\n\n### Current Workaround\n\nThe only workaround is to not use `preserveContent` and avoid combining deferred content with animations - but this limits the functionality that Angular ARIA accordion can provide.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(aria/accordion): `preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds\" (#32590)"},{"Id":"3757675368","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-23T15:08:31","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"32589","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(devinfra): Get rid of max-line-length stylelint","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nNow that Sass files are autoformatted by a formatter that does not respect line length limits and automatically defeats attempts to manually conform with them, this check serves no purpose other than to force us to add disablings for it.

This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable\n\n  This includes support for workspace monorepos - all `node_modules` directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Throw an error if the value of the `tokenHelper` or `<url>:tokenHelper` setting contains an environment variable.\n- Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` settings [#&#8203;10376](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10376).\n- Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories [#&#8203;10384](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10384)\n- Fixed a bug ([#&#8203;9759](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9759)) where `pnpm add` would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to its exact version.\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.2): pnpm 10.26.2\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.26.1...v10.26.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Improve error message when a package version exists but does not meet the `minimumReleaseAge` constraint. The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls

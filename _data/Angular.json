First, URL of which could contain query params, which represent current tab, sorting and pagination. E.g. `/first?tab=cats&sortBy=age&sortOrder=asc&pageIndex=3&pageSize=25`.\r\n2. Second, URL of which shouldn't contain query params. E.g. `/second`.\r\n\r\nWhen I navigate from First to Second, query parameters are removed as expected, since I don't use `queryParamsHandling`.\r\n\r\nThough, when I navigate back from Second to First, query parameters aren't restored. This behavior is also expected, but I'd like to have a route configuration option to keep them.\r\n\r\nThe intention behind this in my case is that user should see the same filtered data set as he did before navigation, so he doesn't need to set tab, sorting and pagination again manually.\r\n\r\nI tried to achieve similar behavior by providing user a button, which simulates browser Back via `window.history.back()` and Angular built-in `Location.back()`. Unfortunately, both suffer from duplicated history records [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20317179/1611569), so user has to click the button several times to actually go back, which is unacceptable from UX perspective.\r\n\r\nI also found the following solutions, but neither of them work as needed.\r\n\r\n- https://medium.com/@timofeybm/3-methods-to-save-catalogue-state-and-scroll-position-in-angular-1a46ae4eadca (method 3)\r\n- https://www.angulararchitects.io/aktuelles/sticky-routes-in-angular-2-3/\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16845\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n```\r\n// app-routing.module.ts\r\n{\r\n  path: 'first',\r\n  component: FirstComponent,\r\n  keepQueryParams: true\r\n},\r\n{\r\n  path: 'second',\r\n  component: SecondComponent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThe only alternative I see is manually subscribe to route change, keep query parameters in shared service and restore them when needed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Keep Query Params for Specific Routes on Navigation\" (#37241)"},{"Id":"622422206","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T11:49:51","Actor":"Amrutharajan","Number":"37239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 9 throws exception by MatSelect","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

[#&#8203;37189](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37189)\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **core:** Angular npm packages no longer contain jsdoc comments\n    to support Closure Compiler's advanced optimizations\n\nThe support for Closure Compiler in Angular packages has been\nexperimental and broken for quite some time.\n\nAs of TS3.9, Closure is unusable with the JavaScript emit. Please follow\n[microsoft/TypeScript#&#8203;38374](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38374) for more\ninformation and updates.\n\nIf you used Closure Compiler with Angular in the past, you will likely\nbe better off consuming Angular packages built from sources directly \nrather than consuming the version we publish on npm,\nwhich is primarily optimized for Webpack/Rollup + Terser build pipeline.\n\nAs a temporary workaround, you might consider using your current build\npipeline with Closure flag `--compilation_level=SIMPLE`. This flag \nwill ensure that your build pipeline produces buildable and\nrunnable artifacts, at the cost of increased payload size due to\nadvanced optimizations being disabled.\n\nIf you were affected by this change, please help us understand your\nneeds by leaving a comment on [#&#8203;37234](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37234).\n\n#### [9.1.9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/9.1.8...9.1.9) (2020-05-20)\n\nThis release contains a re-submit of the following 3 commits with fixes for TS 3.8.\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **elements:** capture input properties set before upgrading the element ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([#&#8203;37226](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37226)) ([a33cb2d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a33cb2d)), closes [#&#8203;30848](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/30848) [#&#8203;31416](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/31416)\n-   **elements:** correctly handle getting/setting properties before connecting the element ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([#&#8203;37226](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37226)) ([6ac0042](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6ac0042)), closes [/github.com/angular/angular/pull/31416/files#r300326698](https://togithub.com//github.com/angular/angular/pull/31416/files/issues/r300326698)\n-   **elements:** do not break when the constructor of an Angular Element is not called ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([#&#8203;37226](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37226)) ([1465372](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1465372))\n\n#### [9.1.8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/9.1.6...9.1.8) (2020-05-20)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **core:** Host classes should not be fed back into `@Input` ([#&#8203;35889](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/35889)) ([f872b69](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f872b69)), closes [#&#8203;35383](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/35383)\n-   **core:** inheritance delegate ctor regex updated to work on minified code ([#&#8203;36962](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36962)) ([e3d3395](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e3d3395))\n-   **elements:** capture input properties set before upgrading the element ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([1c8f179](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1c8f179)), closes [#&#8203;30848](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/30848) [#&#8203;31416](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/31416)\n-   **elements:** correctly handle getting/setting properties before connecting the element ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([363f14c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/363f14c)), closes [/github.com/angular/angular/pull/31416/files#r300326698](https://togithub.com//github.com/angular/angular/pull/31416/files/issues/r300326698)\n-   **elements:** do not break when the constructor of an Angular Element is not called ([#&#8203;36114](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36114)) ([87b9f08](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/87b9f08))\n-   **router:** update type for routerLink to include null and undefined ([#&#8203;37018](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37018)) ([7de7871](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7de7871)), closes [#&#8203;13380](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/13380) [#&#8203;36544](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/36544)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When installing the NPM as a regular NPM package or when configuring a direct path to the .css the .css is bundled.\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, it seems that the 'complex' style configuration does not support NPM links.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. create an npm package in a directory _/some-package_. Add a .css file in _/some-package/dist/some-package.css_ and a package.json. Name the package _@company/some-package_.\r\n2. create an Angular application in _/application_. \r\n3. add a link to 'some-package' int the dependencies section of the package.json of the application: `\"@company/some-package\": \"file:../some-package\"`.\r\n4.

Also date and time are not usually separated by `,`, but can be.\r\n\r\nSince Angular and the Angular CLI limits the customization of locale information, this becomes a problem for the projects at [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/) (national public transport provider), since the locales are specified by business for SBB projects.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like to have a feature to provide our own locales, maybe with a warning for possible imcompatibility.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n      ...\r\n      \"i18n\": {\r\n        \"locales\": {\r\n          \"de-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.de-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/de/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/de-CH\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"fr-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.fr-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/fr/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/fr-CH\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"it-CH\": {\r\n            \"translation\": \"src/i18n/messages.it-CH.xlf\",\r\n            \"baseHref\": \"/it/\",\r\n            \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/it-CH\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"sourceLocale\": {\r\n          \"code\": \"en-CH\",\r\n          \"baseHref\": \"/en/\",\r\n          \"localeImport\": \"example-library/locales/en-CH\"\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis sould be doable, by changing `configureI18nBuild` in `packages\\angular_devkit\\build_angular\\src\\utils\\i18n-options.ts`, so that it tries to resolve custom locale imports before calling `findLocaleDataPath`.\r\nI'm also fine with printing a warning to point out possible incompatiblity issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are not opposed to this feature I can also provide a PR.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nEither patch the locale data after startup or register all custom locales with `registerlocaledata`, which is cumbersome.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17752","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: Provide possibility to define custom locale imports for i18n builds\" (#17752)"},{"Id":"619958564","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-18T06:58:06","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17750","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update copy-webpack-plugin to version 6.0.1","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17750","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update copy-webpack-plugin to version 6.0.1\" (#17750)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"622681348","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-22T03:02:36","Actor":"atscott","Number":"19413","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add characterization tests for DocsMarkedRenderer","State":"closed","Body":"These tests are meant to simply document and verify the existing\r\nbehavior of the DocsMarkedRenderer.

Both behaviours are OK (if a bit counterintuitive) but the observed difference is confusing at best, consistent behaviour would be great. If out of the scope of the component (and down to the browser) we could have some caveat on the documentation mentioning that mouse events during drag will not necessarily be consistent in different browsers implementation.\r\n\r\nI am activating some information panel on the currently dragged and I can work around by adding guards variable in mousedown(activate a flag), mouse events (ignored if flag), dropped callback(deactivate flag). Mouseup is not called on the dropped callback though, so it may be called in the future (as that is not part of the documented 'contract' either) and may break my code.  A note about mouse events not being part of the contract (and therefore potentially exhibiting undefined behaviour) on the docs would definitely help.\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots attached\r\nfirefox:\r\n![firefox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1434295/82611159-2da47480-9bc0-11ea-8d6c-fdac98089f04.png)\r\n\r\nchrome and safari:\r\n![other-browsers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1434295/82611168-32692880-9bc0-11ea-9b74-ba273405f3fd.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19418","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug([drag-drop]): mouse events during CDK drag have inconsistent behaviour in major browsers\" (#19418)"},{"Id":"622787587","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T21:04:57","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"19417","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(markdown-to-html): use regex to match new API","State":"open","Body":"Remove trailing comma in example comment. \r\nReplace differentiating between new and old API with regex match instead of `.startsWith('{')`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19417","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(markdown-to-html): use regex to match new API\" (#19417)"},{"Id":"622732083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T19:33:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"19416","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(stepper): error state example not set up correctly","State":"open","Body":"The `stepper-errors` example was set up using a linear stepper which doesn't allow users to move to a different step if the current one is invalid which means that the user doesn't have a way of seeing the error state.\r\n\r\nThese changes make the stepper non-linear, expand the example description to explain how the error state works, and add some text so users know what to do in order to see the error state.\r\n\r\nFixes #19407.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19416","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(stepper): error state example not set up correctly\" (#19416)"},{"Id":"622712802","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T19:02:24","Actor":"jacobweber","Number":"19414","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(a11y): Focus styles not applying in Shadow DOM inside an element with *ngIf","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-e7d8vq\r\n\r\n(or use [my fork](https://stackblitz.com/edit/no-focus-style-for-interactive-element-shadowdom-ryzkx5) of the reproduction from #19133, with an *ngIf condition wrapped around the component)\r\n\r\nI found #19133, which looks like it was fixed in 9.2.4.

Open the Stackblitz above on either FF or non-Chromium Edge. The Stackblitz contains a `mat-checkbox` that disables itself when activated.\r\n2. Activate the `mat-checkbox` with space. Observe that the `mat-checkbox` is now indeed disabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect that the `mat-checkbox` loses its focus styles (and essentially all of the issues in \"Actual Behavior\" don't occur).\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nObserve the following after activating the `mat-checkbox` with space:\r\n\r\n1. The `mat-checkbox` still has the classes `.cdk-focused` and `.cdk-keyboard-focused`.\r\n2. As a result, the `mat-checkbox` still has focus styles.\r\n3. If you query for the `document.activeElement`, it returns the `mat-checkbox`.\r\n4. Subsequent mouse clicks & focus events on the page do not cause the `mat-checkbox` to lose its focus styles (i.e. it looks focused essentially forever).\r\n\r\nAll of the above are unexpected.\r\n\r\n#### What's Happening\r\n\r\nOn FF and non-Chromium Edge, when a focused element is `[disabled]` it (1) remains the `document.activeElement` and (2) consequently no `blur` event is emitted. These appear to be browser bugs. As a result of this behavior, the attached `FocusMonitor` on `mat-checkbox` (and other components like `mat-button`) never receives a `blur` event to remove the `.cdk-focused` and `.cdk-keyboard-focused` classes on the element.\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n\r\nWe could add some work-around logic to `FocusMonitor` to listen if a monitored element becomes `[disabled]`, and if so, do the same thing we'd do if the element was actually blurred.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: Latest\r\n- CDK/Material: Latest\r\n- Browser(s): FF, non-Chromium Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19402","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(FocusMonitor): If a focused element becomes [disabled], attached FocusMonitor still reports the element as focused (FF, non-Chromium Edge).\" (#19402)"},{"Id":"621763551","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T13:28:55","Actor":"GitHubish","Number":"19401","RawContent":null,"Title":"fr(MODAL): It should be possible to set the speed of the drag and drop","State":"open","Body":"We find that the drag and drop is too slow on our project management application (Trello Like).

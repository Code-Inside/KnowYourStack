This has already been noted with https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46341. `FormControl.value` should also therefore return `T | undefined` but I digress...\r\n\r\nI would like an option to instantiate a `FormControl` / `FormGroup` that restricts whether it (or any of its children) can subsequently be enabled/disabled or not. This will have the benefit of creating more accurate typings for `formGroup.value` where only 'disableable' controls can have a possible `undefined` value.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe `enable()` / `disable()` methods should only be available on a control if it holds a value of type `T | undefined`. Also, if a control was constructed with the `disabled: boolean` property set, it's type should be inferred as `T | undefined`. This will also facilitate more accurate typings for `FormGroup.value` where only those fields which are 'disableable' may hold a value of `T | undefined` while all other fields may only hold a value of type `T`. Here is an example illustrating the desired behaviour:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { inject } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { FormBuilder, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\r\n\r\nclass MyComponent {\r\n\r\n  readonly formBuilder = inject(FormBuilder);\r\n  \r\n  readonly fg = this.formBuilder.group({\r\n    firstName: new FormControl(''), // string\r\n    lastName: new FormControl({ value: '', disabled: false }), // string | undefined\r\n    age: new FormControl({ value: 0, disabled: true }), // number | undefined\r\n    gender: '', // string\r\n    bio?: '' // string | undefined\r\n  }, {\r\n    strictControlDisabling: true // <-- NEW PROPOSED OPTION. NAME COULD BE IMPROVED\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  updateControlsState() {\r\n    this.fg.controls.firstName.disable() // Error: Property 'disable' does not exist on type\r\n    this.fg.controls.lastName.disable() // OK\r\n    this.fg.controls.age.enable() // OK\r\n    this.fg.controls.gender.enable() // Error: Property 'enable' does not exist on type\r\n    this.fg.controls.bio.disable() // OK\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  getFormValue() { // should return { firstName: string, lastName?: string, age?: number, gender: string, bio?: string } \r\n    return this.fg.value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57244","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal for even better typings FormGroup.value\" (#57244)"},{"Id":"2446396817","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-03T15:04:15","Actor":"json-derulo","Number":"57247","RawContent":null,"Title":"Application Builder migration docs should mention new folder structure in dist","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the application builder migration for existing applications does not mention the new folder structure in the `dist` folder.

The rest was generated with `ng new` using default settings (with the exception of routing, which I disabled). The most important part seems to be `AppComponent`'s template:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (true) {\r\n\t<form>\r\n\t\t<input id=\"host\" />\r\n\t\t<p-overlay></p-overlay>\r\n\t</form>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. `p-overlay` is some meaningless component using `animations: []` (see [overlay.ts](https://github.com/perceptron8/quirk/blob/master/src/app/overlay.ts)),\r\n2. It's sibling, `input` identified as `\"host\"`, is enclosed inside a `form`,\r\n3. Initially `form` seems to have no `parentElement` because of `@if` (same would be true if `*ngIf` was used).\r\n\r\nAll of the above had to appear for this bug to occur: element using animations, `input` with id (or name) equal to 'host' and a `form` inside control flow block. Then, `getParentElement` gets no `element.parentNode` because of (3.) and falls back to `element.host`. Next, because of (2.), `element.host` refers to `input` instead of nothing (as form is not so much of a custom element). Finally, there is (1.), which makes `containsElement` being called in the first place.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, that it may be sufficient to change `getParentElement` so it uses `.host` access more carefully (i.e. conditionally).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease note, that the current implementation will also fail for `<a href='...'>` inside a control block as `a` also has `host` property (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/host).\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@if (true) {\r\n\t<a href=\"https://angular.dev/\">\r\n\t\t<p-overlay></p-overlay>\r\n\t</a>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case however, there will be no infinite loop, as `a`'s `host`, being a `String` equal to`\"angular.dev\"`, has neither `parentNode` nor `host`. Still, parent element doesn't really seem to be determined correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome hopefully useful spec links:\r\n- https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-shadowroot-host\r\n- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#dom-form-nameditem\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/perceptron8/quirk\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nBrowser's tab freezes with 100% CPU usage.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.1.3\r\nNode: 22.3.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1801.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         18.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   18.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          18.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nIf you disable animations (globally in `ApplicationConfig` or locally in `Overlay`) _or_ change `input`'s id to something else than `\"host\"` _or_ remove `@if` wrapper, this crazy bug dissapears.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57243","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Infinite loop in shared.ts\" (#57243)"},{"Id":"2445641606","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T19:32:09","Actor":"Hoschi1982","Number":"57242","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only update controls when connecting signals and do not check the component and parent components","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHi, \r\n\r\nI've been looking into signals and I think the introduction is very good. However, I initially thought that the controls that are bound to signals are updated directly and that the current component and its parent components are no longer checked separately when used zoneless. However, that doesn't seem to be the case, as binding two controls in a component to the same signal results in the component itself and its parent components being checked. And that twice, as the same signal is bound to 2 input controls. Are there any ideas or efforts to adapt the binding and change detection so that only and really only the controls bound to signals are updated without checking the current and its parent components?\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nQuestion\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nQuestion","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57242","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Only update controls when connecting signals and do not check the component and parent components\" (#57242)"},{"Id":"2445447119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T17:21:58","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"57241","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): migrate api-gen from dev-infra into the repo","State":"open","Body":"Move the api-gen pipeline into the shared-docs directory\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57241","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(docs-infra): migrate api-gen from dev-infra into the repo\" (#57241)"},{"Id":"2440940888","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T16:53:17","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"57221","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump Angular DevTools to 1.0.17","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57221","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump Angular DevTools to 1.0.17\" (#57221)"},{"Id":"2440945262","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T16:52:43","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"57222","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(devtools): remove duplicate text at end of `release.md` doc","State":"closed","Body":"Somehow the last few lines got duplicated at the end of this doc.

We might as well just flush if we're going to fail the test anyways by throwing if there's no flush at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nnote: blocked on #57137 and a zone.js release","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57239","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): Add 'flush' parameter option to fakeAsync to flush after …\" (#57239)"},{"Id":"2443264225","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T15:53:31","Actor":"atscott","Number":"57234","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): Do not run image performance warning checks on server","State":"closed","Body":"These checks require document so they should not be run on the server.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57234","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): Do not run image performance warning checks on server\" (#57234)"},{"Id":"2444527188","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T09:31:02","Actor":"ahnpnl","Number":"57237","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support single file `Program` for downlevel constructor transformer","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncompiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, I'm the maintainer of `jest-preset-angular` 👋 \r\n\r\nRecently I tried to copy unit tests from https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/transform/jit/test/downlevel_decorators_transform_spec.ts to check how many cases single file transpilation doesn't work with downlevel constructor transformer.\r\n\r\nI've created a PR https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/pull/2615 to demonstrate failing cases.

Basically the spa downloads a config.json, the server reads it from file locally. This works using node and in the client, it doesn't work with the angular dev-server (ng serve).\r\n\r\nThis is how it is done on the server (see APP_CONFIG):\r\n```typescript\r\nexport function app(): express.Express {\r\n  const server = express();\r\n  const serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\r\n  const browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\r\n  const indexHtml = join(serverDistFolder, 'index.server.html');\r\n\r\n  const config = loadConfig(browserDistFolder);\r\n\r\n  const commonEngine = new CommonEngine();\r\n\r\n  server.set('view engine', 'html');\r\n  server.set('views', browserDistFolder);\r\n\r\n  // Example Express Rest API endpoints\r\n  // server.get('/api/**', (req, res) => { });\r\n  // Serve static files from /browser\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '**',\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: 'index.html',\r\n    }),\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\r\n    const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n    commonEngine\r\n      .render({\r\n        bootstrap,\r\n        documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n        url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n        publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n        providers: [\r\n          { provide: APP_BASE_HREF,

return server;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is the main.ts for the client side provider:\r\n```typescript\r\nfetch('/assets/config/config.json')\r\n  .then((response) => response.json())\r\n  .then((serverConfig) => {\r\n    // Create a new config object with the server config\r\n    const serverAppConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\r\n      providers: [{ provide: 'APP_CONFIG', useValue: serverConfig }],\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    const mergedConfig = mergeApplicationConfig(appConfig, serverAppConfig);\r\n    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, mergedConfig).catch((err) => console.error('Error during bootstrap:', err));\r\n  })\r\n  .catch((err) => {\r\n    console.error('Failed to load configuration:', err);\r\n    // Fallback to bootstrapping with just the original app config\r\n    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig).catch((err) => console.error('Error during bootstrap:', err));\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

I suppose with MatSelect.\r\n\r\nI have a div that contains a breadcrumb path, which can be scrolled horizontally if it overflows.\r\nAnd I have MatSelect in the path to allow changing directory.\r\n\r\nBut when I'm at the end of the scrolled div (right), I scroll left and click on a MatSelect to change directory, the container jump to the end and do not let me select option...\r\n\r\nSo I supposed it is a bug because I've tried with a simple `select` and I do not have this problem :\r\n\r\nCode to replace in `src/app/components/site-breadcrumb/site-breadcrumb-element/site-breadcrumb-element.component.html` if you want to test with native `select` :\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"breadcrumb-element\">\r\n    <select>\r\n        <option></option>\r\n        <option [value]=\"breadcrumb\" [selected]=\"breadcrumb == selectedBreadcrumb\" *ngFor=\"let breadcrumb of breadcrumbs\">\r\n            {{ breadcrumb.label }}\r\n        </option>\r\n    </select>\r\n</div>\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

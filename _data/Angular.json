All those components must be imported into the consumer application for a UI feature to work. Let' say we have a `TabModule`. The `TabModule` looks something like this:\r\n\r\n**library**\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent],\r\n  exports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class TabModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn module land, a consumer of our library can simply import the `TabModule` and the Tab feature works. In standalone land the consumer has to import the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent`.\r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```typescript\r\n// Module land\r\nimport {TabModule} from '@my-org/lib';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [TabModule]\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Standalone land\r\nimport {TabGroupComponent, TabComponent} from '@my-org/lib';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis works great, but for better developer experience, we would additionally want to offer the possibility to import all components at once. Therefore we can create a `index.ts` file where we export an array that contains the `TabGroupComponent` as well as the `TabComponent`.\r\n\r\n**library - index.ts**\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const TabComponents = [\r\n  TabGroupComponent, TabComponent\r\n];\r\n```\r\n With this approach, the consumer could then simply import the `TabComponents`.\r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabComponents]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComp {}\r\n```\r\nThis works great in a multi-project workspace where we built our SPA from the library sources. But once we build our library for prod, package it and publish it on npm this approach no longer works.\r\n\r\nWe get the following compile error: \r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```\r\nError: src/app/standalone.component.ts:17:5 - error NG1010: 'imports' must be an array of components, directives, pipes, or NgModules.\r\n  Value is a reference to 'TabComponents'.\r\n\r\n17     TabComponents\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/lonely-lib/lib/index.d.ts:2:22\r\n    2 export declare const TabComponents: any[];\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Reference is declared here.\r\n\r\n\r\n✖ Failed to compile.\r\n```\r\nWe also had the case where we did not get this error but the build still failed because it was telling us that neither the `TabGroupComponent` nor the `TabComponent` were provided.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to import the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent` individually and locally create an array with them. \r\n\r\n**consumer**\r\n```\r\nconst components = [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent];\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent, TabComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nthis one worked without errors.\r\nWe then also compared the array here with the array from our library by logging them in the constructor - and they are identical. Both are arrays containing the `TabGroupComponent` and the `TabComponent`. Therefore we believe it is a bug in the compiler.\r\n\r\nThx, a lot for your feedback and the great efforts to enable standalone components in Angular.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: src/app/standalone.component.ts:17:5 - error NG1010: 'imports' must be an array of components, directives, pipes, or NgModules.\r\n  Value is a reference to 'TabComponents'.\r\n\r\n17     TabComponents\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/lonely-lib/lib/index.d.ts:2:22\r\n    2 export declare const TabComponents: any[];\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Reference is declared here.\r\n\r\n\r\n✖ Failed to compile.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.6\r\nNode: 19.3.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.2.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.6\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Standalone library barrel files\" (#49888)"},{"Id":"1671272798","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T15:48:31","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"49885","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency eslint-plugin-jsdoc to v41","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [eslint-plugin-jsdoc](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) | devDependencies | major | [`^40.0.0` -> `^41.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/40.0.0/41.1.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc</summary>\n\n### [`v41.1.2`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.1.1...v41.1.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.1.1...v41.1.2)\n\n### [`v41.1.1`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.1.0...v41.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.1.0...v41.1.1)\n\n### [`v41.1.0`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.0.0...v41.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v41.0.0...v41.1.0)\n\n### [`v41.0.0`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.3.0...v41.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.3.0...v41.0.0)\n\n### [`v40.3.0`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.2.1...v40.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.2.1...v40.3.0)\n\n### [`v40.2.1`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.2.0...v40.2.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.2.0...v40.2.1)\n\n### [`v40.2.0`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.2...v40.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.2...v40.2.0)\n\n### [`v40.1.2`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.1...v40.1.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.1...v40.1.2)\n\n### [`v40.1.1`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.0...v40.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.1.0...v40.1.1)\n\n### [`v40.1.0`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.3...v40.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.3...v40.1.0)\n\n### [`v40.0.3`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.2...v40.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.2...v40.0.3)\n\n### [`v40.0.2`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.1...v40.0.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.1...v40.0.2)\n\n### [`v40.0.1`](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.0...v40.0.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/compare/v40.0.0...v40.0.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This results in non-distorted images being reported as distorted and vice-versa. This is due to the rendered aspect ratio being calculated from the [`clientWidth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth) and [`clientHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight) which includes the padding of the element.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n`clientWidth` and `clientHeight` have been replaced by [`getComputedStyle(img).getPropertyValue('width')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) (and height equivalent) and depending on the [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing), the padding is subtracted prior to ratio calculation. This always results in the correct ratio.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of using computed width over `clientWidth` (and same for height) is that computed width returns a decimal, in contrast to the integer for `clientWidth`, which allows for greater accuracy in determining the ratio of the rendered image which prevents false positive distortion checks. It might even be possible to lower the `ASPECT_RATIO_TOLERANCE` (currently set to 0.1) and reduce the amount of false negatives.\r\n\r\nPlay around with the calculations here: <https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-image-ratio-playground?file=src/main.ts>. Scenarios are defined in `main.ts` and rendered showing the results of the various ways to calculate the ratio and whether the particular calculation is correct.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n### Test added for rounding errors\r\nI've added a test that checks for a false positive distortion check that occurs when using integers for the dimensions. This is fixed by using the computed dimensions which are returned as decimals. While this is, in my opinion, a useful addition, I could remove it if it is not desired.\r\n\r\n### Updating playground code in angular codebase\r\nI could update the playground at [`packages/core/test/bundling/image-directive/playground.ts`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3ba5dcc150676da01cbe6dc66ba6d4b3a3667bf1/packages/core/test/bundling/image-directive/playground.ts) with the setup of my stackblitz if desired. This would probably be another PR though.\r\n\r\n### Extract to separate function\r\nPerhaps the image dimensions extraction would be better in a utils lib, or exported for reuse elsewhere. If so, please let me know and I'll update it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49889","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix NgOptimizedImage distortion check for padded images\"

will result in type narrowing. Previously if you used type guard functions, it resulted in no changes to the return type. Now the type would be narrowed, which might require updates to the application code that relied on the old behavior.\r\n-   The `ReflectiveInjector` and related symbols were removed. Please update the code to avoid references to the `ReflectiveInjector` symbol. Use `Injector.create` as a replacement to create an injector instead.\r\n\r\n##### platform-browser\r\n\r\n-   The deprecated `BrowserTransferStateModule` was removed, since it's no longer needed. The `TransferState` class can be injected without providing the module. The `BrowserTransferStateModule` was empty starting from v14 and you can just remove the reference to that module from your applications.\r\n\r\n##### core\r\n\r\n| Commit | Type | Description |\r\n|

This could also allow implementing useful devtools.**\r\n\r\nThanks to Signals, Angular has a relatively fine-grained knowledge of which views should be marked for check.\r\nThis information is not currently shared with the developer. If it was propagated through a public API, this would be an enabler for different community initiatives:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Custom Change Detection Strategies\r\nDevelopers could implement custom change detection strategies per view by detaching the change detector and implementing their own logic.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nviewRef.detach();\r\nviewRef.onMarkDirty(() => customScheduler.scheduleChangeDetection(viewRef));\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### 2. DevTools\r\n\r\nWe can imagine new devtools tracking which components are marked dirty when a specific signal changes for example.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe main drawbacks of exposing such an API are:\r\n- the abuse and misuse of `onMarkDirty()` and naive scheduling strategies that would schedule more change detections or manual renders than necessary... or even trigger some infinite loops.\r\n- triggering change detection synchronously in the callback would read signals while \"write\" is propagated\r\n(that said, this would throw an error, right?)\r\n\r\n### When to call the callback?\r\n\r\nShould the callback be triggered whenever `markViewDirty()` is called? Or do we need more fine-grained notifications to tell if an input changed, or a signal (might have) changed, or an event listener was triggered?\r\n\r\n### Should it be exposed on `ChangeDetectorRef`?\r\n\r\nThe method could be exposed on `ChangeDetectorRef`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd a `ViewRef.onMarkDirty(callback: () => void)` method to notify developers when the view is marked dirty using `markViewDirty(view)`\r\n\r\nwhether it's caused by signals:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e9dd7f00280b6d52fa2a21da793521db1a9d7a53/packages/core/src/render3/reactive_lview_consumer.ts#L32\r\n\r\nor other means.\r\n\r\nThis could be combined with https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49884\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nOverriding `ReactiveLViewConsumer.onConsumerDependencyMayHaveChanged()` at runtime.\r\n\r\nCf. https://marmicode.io/blog/angular-signals-and-custom-render-strategies\r\n\r\nThis is fragile as it's hacking into internal APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49882","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add a `ViewRef.onMarkDirty(callback)` method as an enabler for custom Change Detection strategies + debug tools\" (#49882)"},{"Id":"1670966866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T15:36:13","Actor":"yjaaidi","Number":"49884","RawContent":null,"Title":"Roll out the red carpet for Zoneless Angular by providing custom ChangeDetectionStrategy","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn order to implement zoneless Angular apps, developers must either trigger change detection manually or use libraries like [RxAngular](https://www.rx-angular.io/) and custom pipes (e.g. `PushPipe`) & directives.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide a seamless way of migrating to zoneless Angular, without necessarily switching to signal-based components (which are not here yet), it would be nice if apps that are not heavily relying on Zone.js _(i.e. using Signals or RxJS + `AsyncPipe`)_ could provide a custom change detection strategy.\r\n\r\nThis strategy would allow developers to decide when to schedule change detection for a view when it is marked dirty.\r\n\r\nThis could be combined with https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49882\r\n\r\n#### Warning: We need a default built-in zoneless strategy\r\n\r\nThe main problem with this approach is that the most naive implementation would simply trigger change detection whenever a view is marked for check. This could cause worse performance than zoneful apps and would break if Signals are used as Signals would be read during write phase (because views are marked dirty during this phase)\r\n\r\nThat is why, this should be provided with a default zoneless strategy with a generally efficient scheduling + coalescing strategy.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis is how the `ChangeDetectionStrategy` interface could look:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ChangeDetectionStrategy {\r\n  handleMarkDirty(changeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRef): void\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it could be provided at the app level:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbootstrapApplication(RootCmp, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {provide: ChangeDetectionStrategy, useClass: ZonelessChangeDetectionStrategy},\r\n    {provide: NgZone, useClass: NoopNgZone},\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nUse [RxAngular](https://www.rx-angular.io/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49884","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Roll out the red carpet for Zoneless Angular by providing custom ChangeDetectionStrategy\" (#49884)"},{"Id":"1669601019","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T14:55:00","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"49869","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): remove `incrementalDriver` on the compiler","State":"closed","Body":"The CLI now only uses the `incrementalDriver` property.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49869","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): remove `incrementalDriver` on the compiler\" (#49869)"},{"Id":"1671277710","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T14:10:32","Actor":"leo6104","Number":"49886","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mismatch `preserveWhitespaces` in `angularCompilerOptions` between tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.server.json cause hydration error.

[`v0.17.17`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01717)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.16...v0.17.17)\n\n-   Fix CSS nesting transform for top-level `&` ([#&#8203;3052](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3052))\n\n    Previously esbuild could crash with a stack overflow when lowering CSS nesting rules with a top-level `&`, such as in the code below. This happened because esbuild's CSS nesting transform didn't handle top-level `&`, causing esbuild to inline the top-level selector into itself. This release handles top-level `&` by replacing it with [the `:scope` pseudo-class](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-scope-pseudo):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    &,\n    a {\n      .b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    :is(:scope, a) .b {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Support `exports` in `package.json` for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3058](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3058))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 added the ability to use `extends` in `tsconfig.json` to reference a path in a package whose `package.json` file contains an `exports` map that points to the correct location. This doesn't automatically work in esbuild because `tsconfig.json` affects esbuild's path resolution, so esbuild's normal path resolution logic doesn't apply.\n\n    This release adds support for doing this by adding some additional code that attempts to resolve the `extends` path using the `exports` field. The behavior should be similar enough to esbuild's main path resolution logic to work as expected.\n\n    Note that esbuild always treats this `extends` import as a `require()` import since that's what TypeScript appears to do. Specifically the `require` condition will be active and the `import` condition will be inactive.\n\n-   Fix watch mode with `NODE_PATH` ([#&#8203;3062](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3062))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATH` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously a bug prevented esbuild's watch mode from picking up changes to imported files that were contained directly in a `NODE_PATH` directory. You're supposed to use `NODE_PATH` for packages, but some people abuse this feature by putting files in that directory instead (e.g. `node_modules/some-file.js` instead of `node_modules/some-pkg/some-file.js`). The watch mode bug happens when you do this because esbuild first tries to read `some-file.js` as a directory and then as a file. Watch mode was incorrectly waiting for `some-file.js` to become a valid directory. This release fixes this edge case bug by changing watch mode to watch `some-file.js` as a file when this happens.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/ini</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;410-httpsgithubcomnpminicomparev400v410-2023-04-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`622106a`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/622106a1a0bcd2bc32bfd2e6f9cc45a1a1cb53f7) [#&#8203;205](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/205) add \"align\" and \"sort\" options ([#&#8203;205](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/205)) ([@&#8203;rquadling](https://togithub.com/rquadling))\n-   [`dc64a1a`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/dc64a1a3aa322c0c258383bedcae738aaa67028d) [#&#8203;204](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/204) add bracketedArray option ([#&#8203;204](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/204)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n-   [`6a3cb38`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/6a3cb38b134f674dff1a7b5d3732553e8bace777) [#&#8203;199](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/199) add platform option to force line endings ([#&#8203;199](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/199)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), Francois-Xavier Kowalski)\n-   [`b363ae6`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/b363ae67ddf9b1232daafb3cc2b2b1e5cb656406) [#&#8203;198](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/198) add newline option ([#&#8203;198](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/198)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), Francois-Xavier Kowalski)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`ad4b5d8`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/ad4b5d8423f67d67b8683ac8e809b9dd23fe82e2) [#&#8203;200](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/200) Refactored section split logic ([#&#8203;200](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/200)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar), [@&#8203;platinumazure](https://togithub.com/platinumazure))\n-   [`5b5c9b7`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/5b5c9b777209bae480f62fb80149008350d37bc5) [#&#8203;123](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/123) residual space after section causes bad parsing ([#&#8203;123](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/123)) ([@&#8203;Nautigsam](https://togithub.com/Nautigsam))\n-   [`fa2c17e`](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/commit/fa2c17e6e5f4ebaec30e08653b9603049c8cf0c3) [#&#8203;201](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/pull/201) ignore all whitespace lines ([#&#8203;201](https://togithub.com/npm/ini/issues/201)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.22`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8422)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.21...8.4.22)\n\n-   Fixed TypeScript support with `node16` (by Remco Haszing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/node-semver</summary>\n\n### [`v7.5.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;750-httpsgithubcomnpmnode-semvercomparev740v750-2023-04-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/compare/v7.4.0...v7.5.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`503a4e5`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/503a4e52fe2b1c6ed1400d33149f7733c8361eed) [#&#8203;548](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/548) allow identifierBase to be false ([#&#8203;548](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/548)) ([@&#8203;lsvalina](https://togithub.com/lsvalina))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`e219bb4`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/e219bb454036a0c23e34407591f921c8edb688e7) [#&#8203;552](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/552) throw on bad version with correct error message ([#&#8203;552](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/552)) ([@&#8203;wraithgar](https://togithub.com/wraithgar))\n-   [`fc2f3df`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/fc2f3df0b5d25253b3580607e111a9a280d888ca) [#&#8203;546](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/546) incorrect results from diff sometimes with prerelease versions ([#&#8203;546](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/546)) ([@&#8203;tjenkinson](https://togithub.com/tjenkinson))\n-   [`2781767`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/commit/27817677794f592b592bf6181a80a4824ff762b2) [#&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/pull/547) avoid re-instantiating SemVer during diff compare ([#&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/npm/node-semver/issues/547)) ([@&#8203;macno](https://togithub.com/macno))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.13.3`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4133-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4132v4133-2023-04-15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.13.2...v4.13.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

The main one is that removing `--noshow_progress` will make Bazel print progress updates which tells Circle CI that test execution is still ongoing and avoids test failures due to lack of output.\r\n\r\nThe other notable trade-offs being made here are:\r\n1. [`--keep_going`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#keep-going) means `bazel test` will run all tests report all failures, which could be slower and noisier than reporting just the first failure but is more complete.\r\n2. [`--build_tests_only`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#build-tests-only) means only tests and binaries will be built, so any library targets not tested could have build errors hidden.

The first visible index is now calculated based on the relation from the current scrollOffset to the max scrollOffset.\r\nSince the total content size can be off for a larger amount, it is now smoothly corrected and no longer just set to the estimated total content size.\r\n\r\nThe `virtual-for-of.ts` had a bug (?) which made it impossible to measure the size of the last item. This is now fixed, but probably a breaking change.\r\n\r\nScrolling to an index is now implemented. When scrolling to an index, the target offset for the index is calculated based in the estimated item size and a correction in case there is already a difference between the current offset and the current estimated offset. When smooth scrolling is activated, multiple scroll events will occur.\r\n\r\nWhile scrolling to an index, the behavior is different from normal user scrolling. The problem that needs to be solved in this case is, that we are scrolling to an estimated offset, which could be off but cannot be corrected anymore. Therefore, we need to adjust the content offset, even if it increases the amount of error.\r\nThis is done in two steps:\r\n- while scrolling, the rendered range is calculated based in the already scrolled amount in relation to the max scroll distance\r\n- once the target index is rendered for the first time, the content will be ideally adjusted and then no longer modified till the scroll is completed\r\n\r\nThere are some special cases, that need extra care:\r\n- target index is already rendered --> scrolling precisely by the amount of pixels\r\n- estimated target scroll offset is already rendered, but target index is not --> scroll by sizes of rendered items in between  - estimated item sizes for non-rendered items in between\r\n- scrolling to an index which close to the end of the list, so that the remaining items are smaller than the viewport --> scroll to the end as far as possible\r\n\r\nSee #10113\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@mmalerba Can you please provide some feedback here.

Do you mind if I change this by extracting them into an extra component?\r\n- FYI: horizontal window resizing causes content adjustment when scrolled (was an issue before my changes)\r\n- FYI: refreshing the page after scrolling will break scrolling to and index.

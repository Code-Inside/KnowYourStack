Followed the simple steps laid out in: https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started but I'm having issues with the initial load of the site.\r\n\r\nMy app.config looks like:\r\n```\r\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...\r\n    provideServiceWorker('ngsw-worker.js', {\r\n      enabled: !isDevMode(),\r\n      registrationStrategy: 'registerWhenStable:30000',\r\n    }),\r\n    NewAppVersionTrackerService,\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe service watching for updates:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\nexport class NewAppVersionTrackerService {\r\n  private versionCheckIntervalSeconds = 60;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private dialogService: DialogService,\r\n    private swUpdate: SwUpdate,\r\n    private zone: NgZone,\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  public init() {\r\n    this.watchForUpdates();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private watchForUpdates(): void {\r\n    if (!this.swUpdate.isEnabled) return;\r\n\r\n    console.info(`Version Tracker Initializing`);\r\n\r\n    this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\r\n      interval(this.versionCheckIntervalSeconds * 1000).subscribe(() => {\r\n        console.log('Checking for SW Update');\r\n        this.swUpdate\r\n          .checkForUpdate()\r\n          .then((versionFound) => {\r\n            console.log('CHECK RESULT:', versionFound);\r\n          })\r\n          .catch(() => console.log('SW Update check failed?'));\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    this.swUpdate.versionUpdates.subscribe((versionEvent) => {\r\n      switch (versionEvent.type) {\r\n        case 'VERSION_DETECTED':\r\n          console.info(`New application version found, beginning download: ${versionEvent.version.hash}`);\r\n          break;\r\n        case 'VERSION_READY':\r\n          console.info(`New app version ready: ${versionEvent.latestVersion.hash}`);\r\n          this.dialogService.open(DynamicNewApplicationVersionReadyDialogComponent);\r\n          break;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my app.component is:\r\n```\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    appRef: ApplicationRef,\r\n    private newAppVersionTrackerService: NewAppVersionTrackerService,\r\n  ) {\r\n    this.newAppVersionTrackerService.init();\r\n    appRef.isStable.pipe(filter((stable) => stable)).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now'));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose are the only changes I made to the application. But it seems a total crapshoot if the service worked is actually linked to the SwUpdate service the first time you navigate to the page. \r\n\r\nSometimes it looks like:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/11820009/e68f72f2-a0f5-4fb1-8638-9b1c0658992e)\r\nWhich is great, the `checkForUpdate` is returning a value and when I deploy a new version I see the dialog and can refresh. \r\n\r\n**But** sometimes on initial load instead I get this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/11820009/8f5c8ade-9a33-4803-8a76-50270c3002fc)\r\n\r\nThe app is apparently still stable, and I can see the SW is registered in the Application tab of the chrome dev tools. But the `checkForUpdate` promise doesn't actually do anything, it doesn't resolve _or_ reject. And new deployments are never detected. \r\n\r\nAll of the first load testing is done through new instances of the chrome incognito windows.\r\n\r\nRefreshing the page does return this to working correctly, but it would be great if the `checkForUpdate()` promise would work consistently for first time users as well.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.7\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.0.6\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.8\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.7 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.7\r\n@angular/pwa                    17.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55975","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SwUpdate Inconsistent (checkForUpdate does nothing)\" (#55975)"},{"Id":"2309016172","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T19:59:36","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"55974","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): typo in zoneless warning","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

(I may create a new bug for this, if that is not intentional.)\r\nAnyway, there may be other reasons to ignore the casing. And I tried...~~\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nE.g. I want to use query parameters for filtering data with specific terms in my application, so I can do this:\r\n```ts\r\n    this.activatedRoute.queryParams\r\n      .subscribe(params => {\r\n          const paramMap = convertToParamMap(params);\r\n\r\n          const filter = {\r\n            login: paramMap.get(\"login\")\r\n            // ...\r\n          };\r\n          \r\n          // ...\r\n        });            \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast to using `params` (Params) directly, it does not throw,\r\n\r\nNow, if I pass `...?login=blaBlub` this works, but if I do pass `...?Login=blaBlub` it does not as the usual `convertToParamMap`/param map is case-sensitive, apparently.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nFull credit goes to [Bradley Carey](https://bradleycarey.com/posts/handling-case-insensitive-query-parameters-in-angular/), who has developed a `CaseInsensitiveParamMap` including test cases etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe it can just be integrated in some way or another into Angular?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAny similar solution could also be developed? Like adding a flag to the existing `ParamsAsMap` :\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/87c5f3c521a373af41751a15bea0cd4f16bab23a/packages/router/src/shared.ts#L75\r\n\r\nAlso, it should probably support localization i.e. use [`toLocaleLowerCase`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleLowerCase) or the Angular equivalent.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55968","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add case insensitive (query) param map (CaseInsensitiveParamMap)\" (#55968)"},{"Id":"2308342013","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T13:40:28","Actor":"SCasandra","Number":"55967","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update bootstrapping.md","State":"open","Body":"The root module is not required anymore\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Whether you want to get your hands on a fancy new skin or grab exclusive pickaxes, V-Bucks are the main way to add some new cosmetics to your Fortnite locker.\r\n\r\nWhile the most standard way of getting V-Bucks is by purchasing them through Epic Games directly, there are sometimes, though very rarely, free V-Bucks codes you can redeem to get the Fortnite in-game currency directly to your account. \r\n\r\nIf you are wondering how to redeem and obtain free Fortnite codes, you're in the right place! \r\n\r\nCURRENTLY ACTIVE V-BUCKS CODES LIST\r\nAt the time of writing (May 10, 2024), there are no active free V-Bucks codes in Fortnite. As soon as Epic Games releases any free codes, we'll update this section accordingly. \r\n\r\nLEVEL UP YOUR BETTING GAME WITH OUR PROMOS!\r\nFree codes online are usually released in bundles, where you can also get access to free cosmetics, emotes, and other in-game goodies rather than free V-Bucks. \r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: Please be mindful that some of the above free V-Bucks codes (if any are posted) might only be available in certain regions or may have already expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead over to the official game website for Fortnite\r\nIf you're redeeming a V-Bucks card, head here.\r\nLog into your Epic Games account or sign-up.\r\nSelect the \"Redeem\" tab on your account.\r\nSecure free Fortnite codes by either typing them or copy-and-pasting it into the \"Access Code\" textbox.\r\nIf you face any difficulties redeeming the V-Bucks code, please verify that it's correctly spelled and formatted. Once successfully redeemed, you'll receive a confirmation message or notification.\r\nYour free V-Bucks will be available to use the next time you log in to Fortnite, regardless of whether you're playing on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, or Xbox. GL HF in your next matches!\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN YOU SPEND V-BUCKS ON IN FORTNITE?\r\n\r\nV-Bucks are Fortnite's sole in-game currency, typically bought with real money. They are available in bundles, so 1,000 V-Bucks is £6.99, 2,800 V-Bucks is £17.49, and so on.\r\n\r\nV-Bucks in Fortnite are most often used to purchase in-game cosmetics through the rolling Item Shop. This includes character skins, exclusive pickaxes, gliders, dance emotes, and tons more!\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these goodies, players can also use them to grab the current season's Battle Pass. Each Battle Pass consistently costs 950 V-Bucks, providing a bounty of exclusive content that cannot be unlocked anywhere else.\r\n\r\nIf you make a purchase by accident, you can use a Refund Request on your Epic Games account to be refunded V-Bucks for unwanted skins or cosmetics. This must be done within 30 days of purchase and players only get three Refund Requests a year, so use them wisely!\r\n\r\nHOW ELSE CAN I GET FREE VBUCKS CODES?\r\n\r\nAside from this article, there are some other bonus methods of obtain a free Fortnite code for V-Bucks.\r\n\r\nBe careful when searching for Fortnite redeem codes online, you may encounter scams looking to take advantage of you, like a Fortnite V-Buck generator. These are often are too good to be true and require you to fill in your personal information, supposedly in exchange for a free VBuck generator.\r\n\r\nAlways check the legitimacy of sites claiming to yield free redeem codes, check your PC or device for any malware, and don't click on any suspicious links.\r\n\r\nFortnite Battle Pass Quests\r\nIf there's a new Battle Pass, whether you're on the premium track or free track, there should be plenty of free V-Bucks up for grabs.\r\n\r\nCompleting quests is the best way of fast-tracking your way through the Battle Pass, granting up to 15K Battle Pass XP for completion. Quests could be anything from \"eliminating X amount of players\" or \"completing a specific in-game objective\" and can be achieved through regular gameplay.\r\n\r\nOfficial Fortnite Channels\r\nOne of the most reliable sources for obtaining free codes is through the Epic Games and Fortnite socials, including their Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, they may also reveal exclusive redeem codes on the Epic Games website, so make sure you regularly check out the news section and community forums for free V-Buck code giveaways, promotions, and more.\r\n\r\nIf you're purchasing V-Bucks, only do so via Epic Games or through irl retailers like Best Buy, Target, and other stores that offer V-Bucks gift cards.\r\n\r\nStreamer Giveaways\r\nAlthough this isn't a surefire method, many Fortnite streamers host giveaways where they distribute redeem codes to their followers and subscribers. Entering these free giveaways can be a fun way of snagging free V-Bucks codes without having to put much effort in. However, like the lottery, this method relies heavily on luck and cannot guarantee any active codes.\r\n\r\nEXPIRED V-BUCKS CODES\r\nBelow are some outdated Fortnite codes that are no longer active. If you have some time to spare, feel free to try these old V-Bucks codes to see if there are any remaining rewards available.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, please note that we can't guarantee their functionality or that you'll get any rewards upon redeeming them.\r\n\r\nND8H-LW2Z-LKTW-7W22\r\n\r\n69JS-99GS-6344-STT8\r\n\r\n9BS9-NSKB-JAT2-8WYA\r\n\r\nD8PT-33YY-B3KP-HHBJ\r\n\r\nLJG6-DGYB-RMTH-YMB5\r\n\r\nHW6E3-ZTMJD-UML9J-T6LEQ\r\n\r\nSNMY9-NJ9JE-A7GHN-C54NQ\r\n\r\nYGGWX-38PNW-6TE2Q-JVKLS\r\n\r\nXTGL-9DKO-SDBV-FDDZ\r\n\r\nXTGL-9DKO-SD9D-CWML\r\n\r\nSDKY-7LKM-UTGL-LHTU\r\n\r\nSDKY-7LKM-ULMF-ZKOT\r\n\r\nMK2T-UDBL-AKR9-XROM\r\n\r\nMK2T-7LGP-UFA8-KXGU\r\n\r\nPAX7N-79CGE-NMW6T-C9NZG\r\n\r\nFAT6P-PPE2E-4WQKV-UXP95\r\n\r\n8Z35X-3ZWAB-BC57H-EQTQZ\r\n\r\nFAT6P-PPE2E-4WQKV-UXP95\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\r\nUnfortuntaley, there are no free V-Bucks codes available for May 2024.

might be looking to save some money if you play a lot of Xbox games like Minecraft and Fortnite, and often spend cash on games, subscriptions, and other stuff on your console.One of the easiest ways to save is by using free gift card that you can use to get free Xbox code or free video games.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n[<img src=\"https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/assets/145757909/6af71cce-5456-42e9-b80f-08b14aaea1ff\">](https://appcutly.com/xbox-giftcard-codes)\r\n\r\n[<img

them for free though?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nWhether you’re looking for a free gift card you can use to purchase a game or one that’ll get you an Xbox Live subscription for free, we’ve got you covered.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nLegit Ways to Get Free Xbox Gift Cards\r\nHere are 25 ways to get Xbox gift cards for free…\r\n\r\n1. Swagbucks\r\nSwagbucks, if you don’t already know, is a website where you can earn points for doing tasks. These are pretty fun tasks too, like:\r\n\r\nListening to radio\r\nWatching videos\r\nShopping online\r\nYou can even get paid to paly games.\r\n\r\nThe website will also pay you for taking surveys, so if you don’t mind sharing your opinion, this is another way to earn.You’ll get points for doing these tasks that you can redeem for free Xbox gift codes.PayPal is also a redemption option meaning you can cash out your earnings and use the money to purchase Xbox gift cards or stuff in the Xbox store without any cost to you.\r\n\r\n2. Microsoft Rewards\r\nOne of my favorite ways to get free gift cards for the Xbox store is by using Microsoft Rewards.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements\r\nThis is as closest as you can get to getting free Xbox gift cards with no surveys or offers.This is a rewards program from Microsoft that gives you points when you use Bing or Microsoft Edge to search the internet.You’re paid for each search you do (there is a limit on the number of searches you can do in a day though).They’ve also added a dedicated section called Xbox Live Rewards (review) where you can earn points towards gift cards and in-game purchases. Here you can earn in many ways besides searching, including taking quizzes, polls and even setting goals.You can redeem your points for lots of different rewards including Xbox gift cards.I’ve also seen other great rewards for gamers too, like:\r\n\r\nXbox GamePass gift card\r\nFree Xbox Live Membership\r\nSweepstake entries for things like a free console or a lifetime GamePass membership.\r\nIt’s really easy to gain points and have a gift card in no time.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Qmee\r\nLooking for some quick cash to spend on a game you’ve been after?\r\n\r\nWell, give Qmee a try,The website will pay you for doing tasks you’re probably already doing like searching the internet or shopping online.You can also get paid for taking surveys.Then, you’ll be able to redeem your money right to your PayPal account. The best part about Qmee is that it doesn’t have a minimum cash-out amount. This means that you can withdraw your earnings whenever you want to.

So why would a generator give them out?\r\n\r\nThese generators are a waste of time and many of these sites that claim to generate Xbox codes are a scam. Sure, they may spit out codes, but these are not real Xbox Live codes that actually work. They’re just useless.\r\n\r\nThat’s why you should avoid using them. Plus, you don’t want to end up with a virus on your computer or getting scammed either.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a gift card for the console, you are going to have to do something whether that’s watching videos or trying out apps. But these tasks are easy and don’t require that much effort on your part.\r\n\r\nWhat About Xbox Gift Card Giveaways?\r\nYou should always be really careful with giveaways because they can be a hotbed for scammers. Keep your personal information private, like your credit card details and SSN. If a giveaway asks for details like that, then it’s most likely a scam.\r\n\r\nSure, you can sometimes find legit giveaways online. But just be careful about scams.\r\n\r\nPlaces to search for giveaways include:\r\n\r\nSocial media\r\nGoogle\r\nYouTube\r\nTwitch\r\nJust search for the term “Free Xbox Code Giveaways” on the platforms above.\r\n\r\nHow to Redeem an Xbox Gift Card\r\nNow that we’ve given you places to get gift cards, you probably want to know how to redeem them.\r\n\r\nWell, it’s pretty simple.\r\n\r\nBelow, I’ll tell you how to redeem an Xbox gift code.

Yes, the Amazon Gift Card codes are safe to use, and you should not worry while using it. The process for redeeming the Amazon Gift Card Code is very simple. You have to type the code from the above on the Amazon Gift Card Code website. When you type the code and submit it for verification, then the backend of the website will check whether the code that you have entered is correct or not. Once you will do this, you will get the reward. The whole process is done by the Amazon official website, so there is no need to worry about it.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements\r\n\r\nHowever, when you are collecting Amazon Gift Card codes from various websites, then make sure that you are collecting them from authentic websites. There are a lot of websites that provide Amazon Gift Card codes, but they inject some scripts which show vulgar ads, consume more performance of your system, viruses, and much more. This can cause a lot of issues, due to which you might face different types of problems. We will suggest that you should be aware of such sites if you are trying to get the fresh Amazon Gift Card Code. There are many users who have faced a lot of issues after visiting such websites.\r\n\r\nIs There Any Amazon Gift Card Code Generator?\r\nAmazon Announces New Line-up of Echo Companion Devices\r\n\r\nYes, there are a lot of Amazon Gift Card Code generators available on the internet. But that is not going to be good for you. This is because the Amazon Gift Card Code Generator asks you to perform some steps if you want to get the code. However, the steps that are listed on the website are not good, and it causes a lot of issues for the users. If you don’t know, the steps involve processes like sharing your number, email, other personal details, sharing with friends, and much more. All of these steps are not good for the users to do because they can cause a lot of issues to you. That’s why it is always suggested to the users not to visit such sites which are asking for email and other personal details.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of users who have tried generating an Amazon Gift Card code with the help of the Amazon Gift Card Code Generator website. But they have reported that the steps which were there on the website were not good for anyone to follow. There are many users who have followed the steps, they have done all the processes properly, but at last, they got the code that was not working at all. Also, they have shared their personal details, due to which they are getting suspicious emails. It is causing them a lot of problems.\r\n\r\nThus, we will suggest all users not trust such websites. It is because they will generate the wrong codes, as it is not possible for them to generate the codes which will be working. Also, if you are going to visit such a website, then do at your own risk. It might be dangerous for you, as your data & privacy might get in trouble.\r\n\r\nWhy is Amazon Gift Card Code Not Working?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of users who have reported that the Amazon Gift Card Code that we have listed above in the guide is not working. Yes, it can happen with the users in various cases. If you have entered the wrong code or with typo mistakes, then you are going to face this issue. Also, you will get the same issue if you are trying to redeem the code which has already been redeemed by any other users. The codes which we are listing are available for a specific time and can be redeemed by only one user. For those who are trying to redeem the code, if anyone else has already redeemed it, then you will be getting the same issues.\r\n\r\nWe can’t help you with this, as the codes can be redeemed by only one user at a time. But you don’t have to worry about it, as we are already working hard to add the codes which are fresh and will work for you. Thus, you have to keep visiting the page regularly, as we will keep updating the codes regularly for you. Also, make sure to try the codes that are listed in the Active Amazon Gift Card Code section. If you are using the codes from the other sections, then you are likely to face the issue.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of users who have not read the full article and started trying the codes which were even listed in the Expired section. We don’t want that you do the same. Thus, make sure to use the codes which are listed above in the Active code section. Also, don’t type it in the field; try to copy and paste it. Even if you have copy pasted, check that it is written properly. If the code is not working, then don’t worry; we will update the new codes the next day. However, you have to make sure to keep an eye on our site to get the latest codes. Otherwise, you will be going to face the same issue.\r\n\r\nWrapping Up\r\nAmazon Gift Card Codes are one of the great ways to buy items that are available on the platform for free. However, the users have to buy the Gift Card codes if they want to gift it to someone else. There are a lot of companies that provide Amazon Gift Card Codes for free. In this guide, we have listed the Amazon Gift Card Code for May 2024. Make sure to check them above in the guide.

to save some money if you play a lot of Xbox games like Minecraft and Fortnite, and often spend cash on games, subscriptions, and other stuff on your console.One of the easiest ways to save is by using free gift card that you can use to get free Xbox code or free video games.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n[<img

them for free though?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nWhether you’re looking for a free gift card you can use to purchase a game or one that’ll get you an Xbox Live subscription for free, we’ve got you covered.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nLegit Ways to Get Free Xbox Gift Cards\r\nHere are 25 ways to get Xbox gift cards for free…\r\n\r\n1. Swagbucks\r\nSwagbucks, if you don’t already know, is a website where you can earn points for doing tasks. These are pretty fun tasks too, like:\r\n\r\nListening to radio\r\nWatching videos\r\nShopping online\r\nYou can even get paid to paly games.\r\n\r\nThe website will also pay you for taking surveys, so if you don’t mind sharing your opinion, this is another way to earn.You’ll get points for doing these tasks that you can redeem for free Xbox gift codes.PayPal is also a redemption option meaning you can cash out your earnings and use the money to purchase Xbox gift cards or stuff in the Xbox store without any cost to you.\r\n\r\n2. Microsoft Rewards\r\nOne of my favorite ways to get free gift cards for the Xbox store is by using Microsoft Rewards.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements\r\nThis is as closest as you can get to getting free Xbox gift cards with no surveys or offers.This is a rewards program from Microsoft that gives you points when you use Bing or Microsoft Edge to search the internet.You’re paid for each search you do (there is a limit on the number of searches you can do in a day though).They’ve also added a dedicated section called Xbox Live Rewards (review) where you can earn points towards gift cards and in-game purchases. Here you can earn in many ways besides searching, including taking quizzes, polls and even setting goals.You can redeem your points for lots of different rewards including Xbox gift cards.I’ve also seen other great rewards for gamers too, like:\r\n\r\nXbox GamePass gift card\r\nFree Xbox Live Membership\r\nSweepstake entries for things like a free console or a lifetime GamePass membership.\r\nIt’s really easy to gain points and have a gift card in no time.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Qmee\r\nLooking for some quick cash to spend on a game you’ve been after?\r\n\r\nWell, give Qmee a try,The website will pay you for doing tasks you’re probably already doing like searching the internet or shopping online.You can also get paid for taking surveys.Then, you’ll be able to redeem your money right to your PayPal account. The best part about Qmee is that it doesn’t have a minimum cash-out amount. This means that you can withdraw your earnings whenever you want to.

So why would a generator give them out?\r\n\r\nThese generators are a waste of time and many of these sites that claim to generate Xbox codes are a scam. Sure, they may spit out codes, but these are not real Xbox Live codes that actually work. They’re just useless.\r\n\r\nThat’s why you should avoid using them. Plus, you don’t want to end up with a virus on your computer or getting scammed either.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a gift card for the console, you are going to have to do something whether that’s watching videos or trying out apps. But these tasks are easy and don’t require that much effort on your part.\r\n\r\nWhat About Xbox Gift Card Giveaways?\r\nYou should always be really careful with giveaways because they can be a hotbed for scammers. Keep your personal information private, like your credit card details and SSN. If a giveaway asks for details like that, then it’s most likely a scam.\r\n\r\nSure, you can sometimes find legit giveaways online. But just be careful about scams.\r\n\r\nPlaces to search for giveaways include:\r\n\r\nSocial media\r\nGoogle\r\nYouTube\r\nTwitch\r\nJust search for the term “Free Xbox Code Giveaways” on the platforms above.\r\n\r\nHow to Redeem an Xbox Gift Card\r\nNow that we’ve given you places to get gift cards, you probably want to know how to redeem them.\r\n\r\nWell, it’s pretty simple.\r\n\r\nBelow, I’ll tell you how to redeem an Xbox gift code.

this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen updating a current project to Angular 18 RC the `ng update` command suggest to update `@angular/build` which is new and not present in the project and consecutively fails if attempted.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/3198469/e776f73c-84bc-4ab7-8ff0-520eedadcd7f)\r\n\r\nThe working command to run is still `ng update @angular/cli --next` instead, but the suggestion is wrong due to the new group name since `@angular/build` has been added as first it now shows up as the group name:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c79a513a766383a5eac44acfbb8ac3aab10bbfc4/packages/angular/cli/package.json#L45-L47\r\n\r\nNot sure what the end goal of the new package is, but assuming the CLI is not going away - perhaps move it back up on to the group so the updates still go though it?\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. create a fresh project with `ng new`\r\n2. run `ng update --next` and inspect listed commends\r\n3. attempt to run `ng update @angular/build --next` as suggested\r\n\r\nFirst reproduced here https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/pull/14237 but also tested on a completely fresh app so pretty sure it'll repro on any existing project.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n> ng update @angular/build --next\r\nThe installed Angular CLI version

Microsoft shipped the decorators proposal in [TypeScript 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) and the decorator metadata proposal in [TypeScript 5.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2/#decorator-metadata), so it's important that esbuild also supports both of these features. Here's a quick example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Shim the \"Symbol.metadata\" symbol\n    Symbol.metadata ??= Symbol('Symbol.metadata')\n\n    const track = (_, context) => {\n      (context.metadata.names ||= []).push(context.name)\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;track foo = 1\n      @&#8203;track bar = 2\n    }\n\n    // Prints [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n    console.log(Foo[Symbol.metadata].names)\n    ```\n\n    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**\n\n    This proposal has been marked as \"stage 3\" which means \"recommended for implementation\". However, it's still a work in progress and isn't a part of JavaScript yet, so keep in mind that any code that uses JavaScript decorator metadata may need to be updated as the feature continues to evolve. If/when that happens, I will update esbuild's implementation to match the specification. I will not be supporting old versions of the specification.\n\n-   Fix bundled decorators in derived classes ([#&#8203;3768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3768))\n\n    In certain cases, bundling code that uses decorators in a derived class with a class body that references its own class name could previously generate code that crashes at run-time due to an incorrect variable name. This problem has been fixed. Here is an example of code that was compiled incorrectly before this fix:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      @&#8203;(x => x) foo() {\n        return Foo\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(new Foo().foo())\n    ```\n\n-   Fix `tsconfig.json` files inside symlinked directories ([#&#8203;3767](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3767))\n\n    This release fixes an issue with a scenario involving a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file from within a symlinked directory that uses the `paths` feature. In that case, the implicit `baseURL` value should be based on the real path (i.e. after expanding all symbolic links) instead of the original path. This was already done for other files that esbuild resolves but was not yet done for `tsconfig.json` because it's special-cased (the regular path resolver can't be used because the information inside `tsconfig.json` is involved in path resolution). Note that this fix no longer applies if the `--preserve-symlinks` setting is enabled.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.77.2`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1772)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.77.1...1.77.2)\n\n-   Don't emit deprecation warnings for functions and mixins beginning with `__`.\n\n-   Allow user-defined functions whose names begin with `_` and otherwise look\n    like vendor-prefixed functions with special CSS syntax.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Properly handle the `--silence-deprecation` flag.\n\n-   Handle the `--fatal-deprecation` and `--future-deprecation` flags for\n    `--interactive` mode.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.17.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.17.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.16.1...v6.17.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   fetch: fix captureStackTrace by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3227](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3227)\n-   fetch: fix wpt test request-upload.any.js by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3234](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3234)\n-   websocket: don't clone buffer by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3240](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3240)\n-   Remove unecessary async from writeBuffer by [@&#8203;DarkGL](https://togithub.com/DarkGL) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3245](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3245)\n-   refactor websocket control frame handling by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3241](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3241)\n-   fix parsing continuation frames in websocket by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3247](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3247)\n-   ci: node nightly test should use node 23 by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3248](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3248)\n-   Add test to verify if the connection is correctly aborted on cancel by [@&#8203;mcollina](https://togithub.com/mcollina) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3219](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3219)\n-   Autobahn suite by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3251](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3251)\n-   websocket: fix 6 autobahn tests by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3254](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3254)\n-   websocket: checkout correct commit in autobahn workflow by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3258](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3258)\n-   Cleanup websocket by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3257](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3257)\n-   websocket: autobahn workflow should fail on error by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3259](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3259)\n-   add bodymixin bytes by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3262](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3262)\n-   perf: avoid buffer cloning by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3264](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3264)\n-   feat: dump interceptor by [@&#8203;metcoder95](https://togithub.com/metcoder95) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3118](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3118)\n-   use private properties in Headers by [@&#8203;KhafraDev](https://togithub.com/KhafraDev) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3269](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3269)\n-   Revert \"websocket: autobahn workflow should fail on error\" by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3270](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3270)\n-   build(deps): bump node from `487dc5d` to `9e8f45f` in /build by [@&#8203;dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3271](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3271)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;DarkGL](https://togithub.com/DarkGL) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3245](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/3245)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.16.1...v6.17.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

However, if I hover over any element with MatTooltip, then focus back on the number input field, the scrolling behavior unexpectedly changes. Instead of scrolling the page, it increments or decrements the number in the input. This issue can also occur on the Angular Material official [website](https://v11.material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1194274/eb1a9a3c-70d4-40f2-a029-9986384023a7)\r\n\r\nThis is not the expected behavior : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/angular/porobbapdry?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftooltip-delay-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a page with a with matInput.\r\n2. Hover over an element with MatTooltip.\r\n3. Focus on the number input field.\r\n4. Try scrolling over the number input field.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected and consistent user experience is that scrolling over a number input field should scroll the page, not change the input's value. This unexpected behavior disrupts the user experience, especially in forms with tooltips and number inputs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a field with matInput is focused, and the user scrolls with the mouse wheel, the default behavior is for the page itself to scroll, not the number in the input field. However, this behavior changes after interacting with an element that has MatTooltip. Specifically, after hovering over a MatTooltip element and then focusing on the number input field, scrolling with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page. Instead, it changes the value in the number input field, incrementing or decrementing it. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and occurs even on the Angular Material official website.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16\r\n- CDK/Material: 16\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System Windows + macOS + ArchLinux\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Unexpected Behavior with Number Input and MatTooltip Scrolling\" (#29074)"},{"Id":"2301479780","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T09:30:16","Actor":"ChazUK","Number":"29063","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAutocomplete): setValue on FormControl does not update AutoComplete Input","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using a custom input field with a FormControl, I am unable to dynamically set the value of the input element via `setValue()`.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vavcrk\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vavcrk\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUsing `setValue()` on the FormControl should update the value of the input element.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInput element value continues to be empty\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17\r\n- CDK/Material: 16\r\n- Browser(s): Chome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29063","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatAutocomplete): setValue on FormControl does not update AutoComplete Input\" (#29063)"},{"Id":"2304021866","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T06:16:31","Actor":"maruthumj","Number":"29069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug #29047 - Glitchy password form field ","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #29047 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bug #29047 - Glitchy password form field \" (#29069)"},{"Id":"2304642935","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T06:14:00","Actor":"dreamstar-enterprises","Number":"29070","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat Select - for label not matching with id - do we have to add an extra attribute?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI think this was actually fixed: https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28948\r\n\r\nI didn't quite understand from the above what we were meant to do.\r\n\r\nBut are we meant to include an extra attribute somewhere here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <!-- label -->\r\n    <mat-label>\r\n      {{entry.key | getAllowanceKey: false}} Allowance Basis\r\n    </mat-label>\r\n  \r\n    <!-- select -->\r\n    <mat-select\r\n      id=\"allowanceBasis-hardware-{{$index}}\"\r\n      formControlName=\"allowanceBasis\"\r\n      required>\r\n      <mat-option>-- None --</mat-option>\r\n      @for (allowanceBasisType of\r\n        AllowanceBasisTypes | sortAlphabetical;\r\n        track allowanceBasisType) {\r\n        <mat-option [value]=\"allowanceBasisType\">{{allowanceBasisType | replaceUnderscores | titleCase}}</mat-option>\r\n      }\r\n    </mat-select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto prevent this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"582\" alt=\"243509402-88ceec48-3c7d-4c7a-a62c-4b9d3694c3f2\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/39380005/b8dbe13a-3791-4c5f-a9b5-0e8219c19fd4\">\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nPlease see above\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nSee above\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29070","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mat Select - for label not matching with id - do we have to add an extra attribute?\" (#29070)"},{"Id":"2305117022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T05:26:00","Actor":"shhdharmen","Number":"29072","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(CdkMenu/CdkContextMenuTriggerFor): Allow CdkMenu to be programmatically opened/closed","State":"open","Body":"## Feature Description\r\n\r\n### Current Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe directive `CdkMenu` is used with combination of `CdkContextMenuTriggerFor`.

Refine documentation of existing APIs and behaviors.\r\n\r\nChanges to Cdk Tree API also apply to Mat Tree API. See “Deprecated” for adopting changes to existing applications.\r\n\r\nAccessibility:\r\n * add CdkTreeKeyManager to provide keyboard navigation for CdkTree and MatTree\r\n * Improve keyboard usability of CdkTreeNodeToggle.\r\n * Improve ARIA semantics of CdkTree, CdkTreeNode, Tree and TreeNode components\r\n * Fix miscellaneous accessibility issues in tree and cdk-tree examples\r\n * Add accessibility instructions to documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n * Add API and usage examples for TreeKeyManager\r\n * Update @angular/cdk/tree and @angular/material/tree to be more consistent\r\n * Update examples to use levelAccessor and childrenAccessor\r\n * Add example for (activation) on MatTreeNode and CdkTreeNode\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: add CdkTree#childrenAccessor and CdkTree#levelAccessor\r\n * Add CdkTree#childrenAccessor. Given a data node, childrenAccessor determines the children of that node.\r\n * Add CdkTree#levelAccessor. Given a data node, levelAccessor determines the level of the node in the parent hierarchy.\r\n * CdkTreeNode#levelAcessor and CdkTreeNode#childrenAccessor replace CdkTreeNode#treeControl.\r\n\r\nSee “Deprecated” for updating apps using treeControl.\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: control expanded state of tree nodes using isExpandable and isExpanded\r\n * Add CdkTreeNode#isExpandable, determines if argument tree node can be expanded or collapsed.\r\n * CdkTreeNode#isExpanded to specify the expanded state.

See “Deprecated” for more information on updating applications.\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: use CdkTree to manage expansion state\r\n * Add CdkTree#isExpanded method.\r\n * Add CdkTree#toggle, CdkTree#expand and CdkTree#collapse methods.\r\n * Add  CdkTree#toggleDescendants, CdkTree#expandDescendants, and CdkTree#collapseDescendants methods to CdkTree\r\n * Add CdkTree#expandAll and CdkTree#collapseAll methods\r\n * Add expandedChange Output to CdkTreeNode\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: add injection token for tree-key-manager\r\n * Add TREE_KEY_MANAGER injection token. When provided, tree uses given key manager\r\n * TreeKeyManagerStrategy interface, which defines API contract of TREE_KEY_MANAGER\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR CHANGE: MatTree and CdkTree components respond to keyboard navigation.\r\n * CdkTree and MatTree respond to arrow keys, page up, page down, etc.; Keyboard commands match [WAI ARIA Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).\r\n * Can no longer set the tabindex on MatTreeNode. See “Deprecated” for adopting existing applications.\r\n * Add TreeKeyManager to cdk/a11y\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: Tree controller deprecated. Use one of levelAccessor or childrenAccessor instead. To be removed in a future version.\r\n * BaseTreeControl, TreeControl, FlatTreeControl, and NestedTreeControl deprecated\r\n * CdkTree#treeControl deprecated. Provide one of CdkTree#levelAccessor or CdkTree#childrenAccessor instead.\r\n * MatTreeFlattener deprecated. Use MatTree#childrenAccessor and MatTreeNode#isExpandable instead.\r\n * MatTreeFlatDataSource deprecated. Use one of levelAccessor or childrenAccessor instead of TreeControl.\r\n\r\nNote when upgrading: isExpandable works differently on Trees using treeControl than trees using childrenAccessor or levelAccessor. Nodes on trees that have a treeControl are expandable by default. Nodes on trees using childrenAccessor or levelAccessor are *not* expandable by default. Provide isExpandable to override default behavior.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: Setting tabindex of tree nodes deprecated.

Inject a TreeKeyManagerFactory to customize keyboard behavior.\r\n\r\nNote when upgrading: an opt-out is available for keyboard functionality changes. Provide LEGACY_TREE_KEY_MANAGER_FACTORY_PROVIDER to opt-out of Tree managing its own focus. When provided, Tree does not manage it’s own focus and respects tabindex passed to TreeNode. When provided, have the same focus behavior as before this commit is applied.\r\n\r\nAdd Legacy Keyboard Interface demo, which shows usage of LEGACY_TREE_KEY_MANAGER_FACTORY_PROVIDER. Add Custom Key Manager, which shows usage of injecting a TreeKeyManagerStrategy\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: disabled renamed to isDisabled.\r\n * CdkTreeNode#disabled deprecated and alias to CdkTreeNode#isDisabled","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29062","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/tree): add levelAccessor, childrenAccessor, TreeKeyManager; a11y and docs improvements\" (#29062)"},{"Id":"2298051076","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T19:19:36","Actor":"rubiesonthesky","Number":"29053","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DragDrop): After cdk update to v17.3.7, tests fail with css parse error \"Could not parse CSS stylesheet\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3.6\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating to version 17.3.7, a lot of our unit tests fails with error \"Could not parse CSS stylesheet\". \r\n\r\nTests are using jest and jest-preset-angular.

Seems like the date picker only shows error for day values above 31, not taking into consideration the month.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-jh9zom?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\nReproduction is based on the values inputted from keyboard.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behaviour would be that the user would be prompted with error message everytime the keyboard value is not a valid date. Therefore the following example would trigger an error message: 2/29/2023, 4/31/2024, 5/32/2024, whereas these would be valid: 2/29/2024, 30/4/2024, 5/31/2024. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe actual behaviour is that day values above 31 will throw an error, while day values below 31 and not valid (30 days months/ february) will automatically switch the date to the next date. Therefore '4/32/2033' will trigger and error, while '4/31/2033' will swtich into '5/1/2033'. Same applies for leap years, '2/29/2023' turns into '3/1/2023'.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29057","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatDatePicker/DateRangePicker): Date picker validation seems to be missing some cases. \" (#29057)"},{"Id":"2300632035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T18:57:52","Actor":"poveu","Number":"29058","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): alignment issue with width 100% (TS) & default max-width (CSS)","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n16\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using MatDialog's `open` method with `{ width: 100% }` and default `max-width` (set in the styles), the dialog is not centered (because `.cdk-global-overlay-wrapper` receives `justify-content: flex-start`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/32791888/5ac3a0a2-869e-40fa-9108-377ce9be9461)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/32791888/80042525-0418-44d7-bfc3-e02d98b433c6)\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems to be caused by `global-position-strategy` file that contains `shouldBeFlushHorizontally` check that doesn't know that the dialog has `max-width` set in the CSS.\r\n\r\nIt works fine with, for example, `maxWidth: '80vw'` set in the `open` method's config (MatDialogConfig) OR if we `open` the dialog with `{ width: '99%' }`.\r\n\r\nIt worked fine in v16.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/kmkyqc?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdialog-content-example-dialog.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

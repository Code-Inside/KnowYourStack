I have various animations on the page. A quick outline:\r\n\r\n 1. There is a main content router-outlet. It uses a simple fade-in/fade-out animation - works great\r\n 2. There is a secondary \"panel\" router-outlet, which shows additional data. It uses the very same router animation, which also works great.\r\n 3. The \"panel\" on the side *also* supports a \"maximized\" mode. This makes the panel wider. In this case the width of the panel is animated (which is an indirect parent div of the actual router-outlet). If this happens, the router animation of the panel does not play properly. While animating the width of the panel, one can see the content of *both* components, the leaving and the entering one on screen for a brief duration.\r\n\r\nI already tried to add `group` with `animateChild()` blocks to my animations to no avail...\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-gci3kd?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\nSwitch between 'One' and 'Two' - this will trigger two animations through different mechanisms - the container width resizing (the one with the red border) and the router animation. The router animation is not played correctly, it will have both components visible without any animation styles applied to them.\r\n\r\nSwitch between 'Two' and 'Three' - this will trigger only the router animation as the animation state of the container stays the same - in this case the animation is rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo visible error, just does not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n7 - 11, stackblitz uses the current stackblitz template using 11.0.8\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIt happens with both chrome and firefox\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router animation not working when also animating an outer container\" (#41483)"},{"Id":"852264871","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-07T10:30:47","Actor":"SebastianPodgajny","Number":"41482","RawContent":null,"Title":"Non-null assertion operator changes template behaviour","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/compiler I guess\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n```\r\n{{ abc?.def.ghi }} is translated into (tmp = abc) == null ? null : tmp.def.ghi\r\n{{ abc?.def!.ghi }} is translated into (abc == null ? null : abc.def).ghi\r\n```\r\nThis is different from TS behaviour because in TS non-null assertion operator doesn't change generated code.\r\nIs this behaviour expected in Angular?\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?target=1&jsx=0&module=1&ts=4.1.5#code/MYewdgzgLgBFCm0BcMCGYCeMC8MwFcAbQgbgCgFoB+AOlQCNgaATeAMwEYLEpaHgAhC3YAmIA\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21180501/113852897-55cba080-979d-11eb-8e0b-70090ea832e9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21180501/113852492-e3f35700-979c-11eb-9e27-71ad1b10d2a2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-bdk613?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.2.6\r\nNode: 14.16.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1102.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1102.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1102.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1102.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              11.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        11.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                      11.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                      11.2.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  11.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular               11.2.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.1102.6\r\nng-packagr                        11.2.4\r\nrxjs                              6.6.3\r\ntypescript                        4.1.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This is great because it allows for situations where multiple versions of a collection are in use, or for collections that require peer dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour is currently not present in architect builders. Those are only resolved in the folder the angular.json file is in, making certain situations impossible.\r\n\r\nA very specific case: I've got a repository that contains tooling, and I'm using typescript 4.2 for this repo. I'm using the angular CLI to configure the projects in the repo, with a homebrew architect builder to create npm packages to run in node.\r\nNow I want to add an angular application to the repo to test packages in the repo, as the tool in question is `@ngx-playwright/jest`, meant for using Jest and Playwright to run e2e tests.\r\nHowever, building the angular app only works if I install `@angular-devkit/build-angular` in the root package.json file, which requires `@angular/compiler-cli`, `@angular/compiler`, `@angular/core`, `rxjs` and `zone.js` as well. It also requires `typscript@>= 4.0 < 4.2` which clashes with the 4.2.3 that I'm using throughout the repo.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm using a package manager that doesn't hoist dependencies (i.e. the behaviour of yarn 2's pnp linker or pnpm)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to install `@angular-devkit/build-angular` in the test application's folder instead of the repo root. This package.json already contains all necessary peer dependencies and it can use 4.1 without me having to downgrade typescript throughout the entire repo.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- Use a package manager that hoists dependencies. This allows for installing the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` package in the test app's folder while it'll still end up in the root `node_modules` so the angular CLI can find it. It will still find the wrong version of typescript though, so I'm still stuck.\r\n- Downgrade my repo to typescript 4.1: this might be possible, but it feels very wrong that the one angular app in the repo should define the typescript version being used to build the node packages throughout the entire repo as well as the typescript language server version used by VS Code.\r\n- Create a separate `angular.json` in the test app's folder. This is the solution I'm going for, but if I have multiple `angular.json` files I'm losing a lot of the ergonomics the angular CLI normally offers.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support resolving architect builders relative to project\" (#20453)"},{"Id":"851271544","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T10:57:22","Actor":"Enivile","Number":"20452","RawContent":null,"Title":"ENOENT on ng serve","State":"closed","Body":"I am using VS Code I encountered the same error once before searched for it but didn't find any solution so I uninstalled the VS code and reinstalled.

Depending on the project size, this could lead to one team member breaking others configurations or mistakenly committing settings that only make sense for the local machine.\r\n- Secrets get checked into the repository by default. Sometimes we use staging/production secrets to connect to external dependencies during development/testing. If we don't remember to revert the changes, secrets could be leaked into the repository.\r\n- Because the build performs a replacement, basic settings that are set during development have to be duplicated in environment.prod.ts and could be missing.\r\n- environment.ts and environment.prod have to be checked into the repository, otherwise, the project won't compile.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe should deprecate environment.prod.ts in favor of environment.development.ts and use the latest as a default file replacement while not performing any replacement for prod builds.\r\n\r\nAlso, a property could be added to support optional file replacements. That way if at build time the file to replace environment.ts doesn't exist, it won't fail (probably a warning).\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to \"strong type\" the variable, that way we have a build-time check that all the environments have the required properties set with the expected type.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be great to consider a \"merge\" process, where instead of replacing environment.ts by environment.*.ts, the properties would be merged.\r\n\r\nI based my suggestions on the way .NET Core app settings are implemented.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nTo achieve the above, I had to do this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22510674/113490593-7f38b380-94a1-11eb-88c3-c384b2268d9d.png)\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't look nice but works...

compiling one or multiple schemas to standalone modules with one or multiple exports.\n-   to reduce the mistakes in JSON schemas and unexpected validation results, [strict mode](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/strict-mode.md) is added - it prohibits ignored or ambiguous JSON Schema elements. See [Strict mode](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/strict-mode.md) and [Options](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/api.md) for more details\n-   to make code injection from untrusted schemas impossible, [code generation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/codegen.md) is fully re-written to be type-level safe against code injection.\n-   to simplify Ajv extensions, the new keyword API that is used by pre-defined keywords is available to user-defined keywords - it is much easier to define any keywords now, especially with subschemas.\n-   schemas are compiled to ES6 code (ES5 code generation is supported with an option).\n-   to improve reliability and maintainability the code is migrated to TypeScript.\n-   separate Ajv classes from draft-07 and draft-2019-09 support with different default imports (see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv#usage) or [v7.0.0-beta.5](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.5) for the details).\n\n**Please note**:\n\n-   the support for JSON-Schema draft-04 is removed - if you have schemas using \"id\" attributes you have to replace them with \"\\\\$id\" (or continue using version 6 that will be supported until 02/28/2021).\n-   all formats are separated to [ajv-formats](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats) package - they have to be explicitly added if you use them.\n-   Ajv instance can only be created with `new` keyword, as Ajv is now ES6 class.\n-   browser bundles are automatically published to ajv-dist package (but still available on cdnjs.com).\n-   order of schema keyword validation changed - keywords that apply to all types (allOf etc.) are now validated first, before the keywords that apply to specific data types. You can still define custom keywords that apply to all types AND are validated after type-specific keywords using option `post: true` in keyword definition.\n-   regular expressions in keywords \"pattern\" and \"patternProperties\" are now used as if they had unicode \"u\" flag, as required by JSON Schema specification - it means that some regular expressions that were valid with Ajv v6 are now invalid (and vice versa).\n\n#### Better TypeScript support:\n\n-   Methods `compile` and `compileAsync` now return type-guards - see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/master#usage).\n-   Method `validate` is a type-guard.\n-   Better separation of asynchronous schemas on type level.\n-   Type utility JSONSchemaType<T> that generates the type for JSON Schema for type interface in the type parameter - it simplifies writing schemas (no unions support at the moment).\n\n#### API changes:\n\n-   addVocabulary - NEW method that allows to add an array of keyword definitions.\n-   addKeyword - keyword name should be passed as property in definition object, not as the first parameter (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning). Also \"inline\" keywords support is removed, code generation keywords can now be defined with \"code\" keyword - the same definition format that is used by all pre-defined keywords\n-   Ajv no longer allows to create the instance without `new` keyword (it is ES6 class). \n\n##### Added options (and defaults):\n\n-   strict: true - strict mode\n-   strictTypes: \"log\" - prevent mistakes related to type keywords and keyword applicability (see [Strict Types](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/strict-mode.md#strict-types))\n-   strictTuples: \"log\" - prevent incomplete tuple schemas (see [Prohibit unconstrained tuples](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/strict-mode.md#prohibit-unconstrained-tuples))\n-   allowUnionTypes: false - allow multiple non-null types in \"type\" keyword\n-   allowMatchingProperties: false - allow overlap between \"properties\" and \"patternProperties\" keywords\n-   loopEnum: Infinity - optimise validation of enums, similar to `loopRequired`\n-   validateFormats: true - enable format validation\n-   code: {optimize: number|boolean} - control [code optimisation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/codegen.md#code-optimization)\n-   code: {es5: true} - generate ES5 code, the default is to generate ES6 code.\n-   code: {lines: true} - add line breaks to generated code - simplifies debugging of compiled schemas when you need it\n\n##### Changed options:\n\n-   `keywords` - now expects the array of keyword definitions (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning)\n\n##### Removed options:\n\n-   errorDataPath - was deprecated, now removed.\n-   format - `validateFormats: false` can be used instead, old format mode can be chosen via ajv-formats package.\n-   nullable: `nullable` keyword is supported by default.\n-   jsonPointers: JSONPointers are used to report errors by default, `jsPropertySyntax: true` (deprecated) can be used if old format is needed.\n-   extendRefs: $ref siblings are validated by default (consistent with draft 2019-09), `ignoreKeywordsWithRef` (deprecated) can be used instead to ignore $ref siblings.\n-   missingRefs: now exception is always thrown.

It's not ideal to have component-specific DOM structure leaking into the global focus indicators stylesheet. We've had a number of bugs come up where tweaking a component's DOM structure has led to focus indicators breaking when we forget to update the stylesheet. Thus, this PR removes the component-specific focus indicator rendering conditions from the global stylesheet, and instead, moves this logic into the components that need it.\r\n2. If a developer wants to add Material focus indicators to a new custom component, they can manually add the `.mat-focus-indicator` class to the appropriate element. However, currently we expect this element to be the actual element that receives focus. We provide no mechanism for a developer to add a focus indicator to an element that doesn't actually receive focus, but should render a focus indicator when some associated element receives focus (e.g. see `mat-checkbox`). This PR introduces a new public CSS class `.mat-focus-indicator-render` that developers can use to \"manually\" render a focus indicator in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe downside to this change is that a handful of components now have `focus` and `blur` event listeners bound to them, in order to update the `.mat-focus-indicator-render` class properly. We could avoid these event listeners by instead updating these components to check something like `inputElement === document.activeElement`, but I wasn't sure which to prefer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/22414","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk/a11y): Move component-specific focus indicator rendering to each component\" (#22414)"},{"Id":"851726676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T19:00:42","Actor":"bq007","Number":"22413","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Mat Table] Voiceover is not announcing mat-table column count correctly in forward navigation.","State":"open","Body":"#### Description\r\n\r\nWhen forward navigating to Mat Table, the VoiceOver screen speaker announces table columns as 0. \r\n![Screen Shot for mat table bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67595364/113763890-39216100-96e8-11eb-96cc-91a9788843f0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nUse Angular Material demos for mat table to reproduce the issue: \r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-dynamic-columns\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

I'm currently creating a graph using Angular/cdk/dragdrop. I need to remove an image in the graph. I'm unable to do this using @ViewChild, since the divs are created dynamically. If I could use dynamically created template reference variables this would solve the issue. Currently, I'm only able to use vanilla javascript. I'm aware that is not a best practice, but don't have another way of dealing with the issue. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nTo add the dynamically created template reference variables. Another option is if the @ViewChild could use the dynamically created id. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've tried using @ViewChild with no luck.

After a lot of digging around I was actually able to get all the requirements for runtime translations running using all the things Angular offers. So it is really just the poor documentation that takes a lot of time on debugging and finding the right functions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest to add a section to the `Internationalization` guide under `Optional internationalization practices`.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIn this guide I would cover the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Explain the necessary functions/variables (`loadTranslations`, `$localize.locale`, `registerLocaleData`, `LOCALE_ID`)\r\n2. Describe the required format of the JSON file for `loadTranslations` and potentially a script to parse `xliff` to `JSON`\r\n3. Show a minimal/simple setup for the `main.ts` and `app.module.ts` for the right initialization\r\n      1. Read locale from `LocalStorage`\r\n      2. Load the translation file using `fetch`\r\n      3. Call `loadTranslations` and init `$localize.locale`\r\n      4. Show how to lazy load only the required locale from `@angular/common/locales/` using webpack\r\n      5. Call `registerLocaleData`\r\n      6. Bootstrap app by dynamically importing `AppModule` **after** loading translations to also translate static variables (see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46783#issuecomment-1183558559))\r\n      7. Set `LOCALE_ID` in `AppModule`\r\n4. Some further considerations\r\n\r\nI am happy to create a PR for this guide as soon as somebody from the Angular team gives me green light for it.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe could also extends the documentations for `loadTranslation` and `registerLocaleData` but then the developers still need to find out that these functions even exist.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46851","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add doc section for runtime translations in internationalization guide\" (#46851)"},{"Id":"1306289333","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-15T17:06:43","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46850","RawContent":null,"Title":"Usability improvement for previous versions on AIO","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you navigate to a previous version of a page using a version-specific URL like: https://v13.angular.io/guide/architecture, there is a banner at the top saying that:\r\n```\r\nThis is the archived documentation for Angular v13.\r\nPlease visit [angular.io](https://angular.io/) to see documentation for the current version of Angular.\r\n```\r\nThe link brings you to the homepage for the current version.

This is ultimately problematic for working in a Yarn pnp environment.  In fact, Angular Material's current `ng-add` logic adds one of their prebuilt styles to the `angular.json` using a relative path to `node_modules`, which is problematic on its own, but even if they adjusted it to be a package-relative path, it wouldn't work since their prebuilts are made accessible through package `exports`.\r\ne.g.:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request is that module resolution for loading styles (and scripts) from the `angular.json` is expanded to support package `exports`, which would allow Angular Material to adjust their `ng-add` to use a package-relative path instead of a `node_modules` relative one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nWithin a new project, run `ng add @angular/material`\r\nAfter completion, change the styles array in the `angular.json` to this:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nRun `ng serve`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to use the above, you get this error on build/serve, since it's treating it as a file path:\r\n```\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat

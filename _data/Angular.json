to this.form each time `ngOnChanges` is triggered, and I'll make the disabled property of the checkbox true when `this.item.name === 111`, but when I click on the other list items, the disabled

Since the `@babel/core` package is already used and imported in the locations that previously used the other babel packages, an overall reduction in both imports and dependencies is possible. Six babel related packages were able to be removed from the root `package.json` and one (also present in the aforementioned six) was removed as a dependency from the `@angular/localize` package. Unfortunately, the functionality used from the `@babel/generator` package is not provided by `@babel/core` and is still present. Further refactoring may allow its removal as well in the future. Additionally, two unused babel packages were removed.\r\n\r\nThe following packages were removed:\r\n* @babel/parser\r\n* @babel/template\r\n* @babel/traverse\r\n* @babel/types\r\n* @types/babel__template\r\n* @types/babel__traverse\r\n* @babel/helper-replace-supers\r\n* @babel/preset-env\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53441","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: reduce direct babel dependencies\" (#53441)"},{"Id":"2031724571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-08T00:24:04","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"53440","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support i18n for @for in template pipeline","State":"open","Body":"Based on #53405","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53440","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support i18n for @for in template pipeline\" (#53440)"},{"Id":"2031683233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T23:31:01","Actor":"ducin","Number":"53439","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): type-safe window.ng","State":"open","Body":"This PR provides strict type definition for the window.ng object used for both console debugging and devtools.

Moreover, the existing type `GlobalDevModeContainer` is was defined as `{ string: Function }` (for any string there is any function). This all doesn't only allow to call anything on window.ng in devtools, but also we lose all the valuable type information when actually calling these utility functions.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nAfter this gets introduced, the `GlobalDevModeContainer` object reuses all definitions of all utilities, so their documentation, params, etc. are available whenever `GlobalDevModeContainer` is imported. Moreover, `window.ng` published not all (any string) functions, but only the existing ones.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53439","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): type-safe window.ng\" (#53439)"},{"Id":"2031676059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T23:22:27","Actor":"zerefel","Number":"53438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Service Worker 504 Gateway Timeout for external resources","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nservice-worker\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe fetch call for external resources, such as analytics scripts, ad manager scripts or styles will always fail when invoked after the service worker has been initialized.

Now I've got my app.module.ts project and I can add stuff in it. \r\n\r\n#### Step two : ####\r\nThe components are standalone again, and the project can't build with the modifications added. \r\n\r\nIf I check the final code available there (https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/toh-pt0/stackblitz.html), I see that components are standalone and that there's no app.module.ts file. \r\n\r\n#### Final steps : ####\r\nThe modules are back and components are no longer standalone. At this stage, my app builds with no errors but routes don't work. \r\n\r\n#### Comments ####\r\nI'm very confused about this tutorial, and cannot find a way to make it work by following every step described. \r\n\r\nDid I misunderstood something, or is the app.module part deprecated ?

I follwed a tutorial ([link](https://medium.com/@joosep.parts/create-an-angular-14-library-use-it-locally-when-developing-and-publish-the-package-to-npm-689ca2efdea8) and everything is doing well. But when I try to add changes to a stylesheet I don't see the changes in my example project.\r\n\r\nE.g. I add `flex-grow: 1;` in a component in the lib the lib will be built (because I started it in a terminal window with `ng build --watch` --> I can see the rebuild) but the style changes aren't reflecting in the example project. Only with `npm install` also the new added styles are available. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n[Example](https://github.com/JuNe98/angular-library-style-bug)\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nI have two terminals startet. In the first I run `ng build test --watch` to build the lib on hotfixes and the second where I run normal `ng serve` with the test application within the same project. When I try to update styles in `test.component.scss` I will never see these new added styles until I make a fresh install of the lib in the app (with `npm install`)\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.3\r\nNode: 18.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.7\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.3\r\n@angular/material               17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.3\r\nng-packagr                      17.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26610","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 17 does not reflect style changes in a library to example app in same project\" (#26610)"},{"Id":"2029987996","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T15:22:49","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26607","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v5.3.3","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.3.2` -> `5.3.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.3.2/5.3.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/TypeScript (typescript)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.3`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v5.3.3): TypeScript 5.3.3\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/compare/v5.3.2...v5.3.3)\n\nFor release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-3/).\n\nFor the complete list of fixed issues, check out the\n\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.3.0 (Beta)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.3.0%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.3.1 (RC)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.3.1%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.3.2 (Stable)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.3.2%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.3.3 (Stable)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.3.3%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n-   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[security]","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [vite](https://vitejs.dev) ([source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.0.4` -> `5.0.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/vite/5.0.4/5.0.5) |\n| [vite](https://vitejs.dev)

[CVE-2023-49293](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-92r3-m2mg-pj97)\n\n### Summary\nWhen Vite's HTML transformation is invoked manually via `server.transformIndexHtml`, the original request URL is passed in unmodified, and the `html` being transformed contains inline module scripts (`<script type=\"module\">...</script>`), it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the transformed output by supplying a malicious URL query string to `server.transformIndexHtml`.\n\n### Impact\nOnly apps using `appType: 'custom'` and using the default Vite HTML middleware are affected. The HTML entry must also contain an inline script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the attacker.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, vite@4.4.12\n\n### Details\nSuppose `index.html` contains an inline module script:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  // Inline script\n</script>\n```\n\nThis script is transformed into a proxy script like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\ndue to Vite's HTML plugin:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/packages/vite/src/node/plugins/html.ts#L429-L465\n\nWhen `appType: 'spa' | 'mpa'`, Vite serves HTML itself, and `htmlFallbackMiddleware` rewrites `req.url` to the canonical path of `index.html`,\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/73ef074b80fa7252e0c46a37a2c94ba8cba46504/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/htmlFallback.ts#L44-L47\n\nso the `url` passed to `server.transformIndexHtml` is `/index.html`.\n\nHowever, if `appType: 'custom'`, HTML is served manually, and if `server.transformIndexHtml` is called with the unmodified request URL (as the SSR docs suggest), then the path of the transformed `html-proxy` script varies with the request URL. For example, a request with path `/` produces\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@&#8203;id/__x00__/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIt is possible to abuse this behavior by crafting a request URL to contain a malicious payload like\n\n```\n\"></script><script>alert('boom')</script>\n```\n\nso a request to http://localhost:5173/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E produces HTML output like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@&#8203;id/__x00__/?\"></script><script>alert(\"boom\")</script>?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich demonstrates XSS.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Example 1. Serving HTML from `vite dev` middleware with `appType: 'custom'`\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev-html\n    - \"Open in New Tab\"\n    - Edit URL to set query string to `?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E` and navigate\n    - Witness XSS:\n    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2456381/287434281-13757894-7a63-4a73-b1e9-d2b024c19d14.png)\n- Example 2. Serving HTML from SSR-style Express server (Vite dev server runs in middleware mode):\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=server\n    - (Same steps as above)\n- Example 3. Plain `vite dev` (this shows that vanilla `vite dev` is _not_ vulnerable, provided `htmlFallbackMiddleware` is used)\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev\n    - (Same steps as above)\n    - You should _not_ see the alert box in this case\n\n### Detailed Impact\n\nThis will probably predominantly affect [development-mode SSR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr#setting-up-the-dev-server), where `vite.transformHtml` is called using the original `req.url`, per the docs:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/docs/guide/ssr.md?plain=1#L114-L126\n\nHowever, since this vulnerability affects `server.transformIndexHtml`, the scope of impact may be higher to also include other ad-hoc calls to `server.transformIndexHtml` from outside of Vite's own codebase.\n\nMy best guess at bisecting which versions are vulnerable involves the following test script\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'node:fs/promises';\nimport * as vite from 'vite';\n\nconst html = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      // Inline script\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n`;\nconst server = await vite.createServer({ appType: 'custom' });\nconst transformed = await server.transformIndexHtml('/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E', html);\nconsole.log(transformed);\nawait server.close();\n```\n\nand using it I was able to narrow down to #&#8203;13581. If this is correct, then vulnerable Vite versions are 4.4.0-beta.2 and higher (which includes 4.4.0).\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.5`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small505-2023-12-04-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.0.4...v5.0.5)\n\n-   fix: emit `vite:preloadError` for chunks without deps ([#&#8203;15203](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15203)) ([d8001c5](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/d8001c5)), closes [#&#8203;15203](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15203)\n-   fix: esbuild glob import resolve error ([#&#8203;15140](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15140)) ([676804d](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/676804d)), closes [#&#8203;15140](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15140)\n-   fix: json error with position ([#&#8203;15225](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15225)) ([14be75f](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/14be75f)), closes [#&#8203;15225](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15225)\n-   fix: proxy html path should be encoded ([#&#8203;15223](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15223)) ([5b85040](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/5b85040)), closes [#&#8203;15223](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15223)\n-   fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;15233](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15233)) ([ad3adda](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/ad3adda)), closes [#&#8203;15233](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15233)\n-   fix(hmr): don't consider CSS dep as a circular dep ([#&#8203;15229](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15229)) ([5f2cdec](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/5f2cdec)), closes [#&#8203;15229](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15229)\n-   feat: add '\\*.mov' to client.d.ts ([#&#8203;15189](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15189)) ([d93a211](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/d93a211)), closes [#&#8203;15189](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15189)\n-   feat(server): allow disabling built-in shortcuts ([#&#8203;15218](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15218)) ([7fd7c6c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/7fd7c6c)), closes [#&#8203;15218](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15218)\n-   chore: replace 'some' with 'includes' in resolveEnvPrefix ([#&#8203;15220](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15220)) ([ee12f30](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/ee12f30)), closes [#&#8203;15220](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15220)\n-   chore: update the website url for homepage in package.json ([#&#8203;15181](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15181)) ([282bd8f](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/282bd8f)), closes [#&#8203;15181](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15181)\n-   chore: update vitest to 1.0.0-beta.6 ([#&#8203;15194](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15194)) ([2fce647](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/2fce647)), closes [#&#8203;15194](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15194)\n-   refactor: make HMR agnostic to environment ([#&#8203;15179](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15179)) ([0571b7c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/0571b7c)), closes [#&#8203;15179](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15179)\n-   refactor: use dedicated regex methods ([#&#8203;15228](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15228)) ([0348137](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/0348137)), closes [#&#8203;15228](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15228)\n-   perf: remove debug only prettifyUrl call ([#&#8203;15204](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15204)) ([73e971f](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/73e971f)), closes [#&#8203;15204](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15204)\n-   perf: skip computing sourceRoot in injectSourcesContent ([#&#8203;15207](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15207)) ([1df1fd1](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/1df1fd1)), closes [#&#8203;15207](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15207)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, if I hover over any element with MatTooltip, then focus back on the number input field, the scrolling behavior unexpectedly changes. Instead of scrolling the page, it increments or decrements the number in the input.

Navigate to a page with a <input type='number'> with matInput.\r\n2. Hover over an element with MatTooltip.\r\n3. Focus on the number input field.\r\n4. Try scrolling over the number input field.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected and consistent user experience is that scrolling over a number input field should scroll the page, not change the input's value. This unexpected behavior disrupts the user experience, especially in forms with tooltips and number inputs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a <input type='number'> field with matInput is focused, and the user scrolls with the mouse wheel, the default behavior is for the page itself to scroll, not the number in the input field. However, this behavior changes after interacting with an element that has MatTooltip. Specifically, after hovering over a MatTooltip element and then focusing on the number input field, scrolling with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page. Instead, it changes the value in the number input field, incrementing or decrementing it. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and occurs even on the Angular Material official website.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 11\r\n- CDK/Material: 11\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28224","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Unexpected Behavior with Number Input and MatTooltip Scrolling\" (#28224)"},{"Id":"2025074755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-05T00:54:41","Actor":"kryshac","Number":"28233","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/overlay): fix overlay margin in isBoundedByLeftViewportEdge","State":"open","Body":"When the overlay is opening 'left-ward' (the content flows to the left) the margin is not calculated correctly because the margin is subtracted twice from the width ([line: 1092](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/0762d69b394343555488b5aaada9444dd1a5083a/src/cdk/overlay/position/flexible-connected-position-strategy.ts#L1092)), but [here](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/0762d69b394343555488b5aaada9444dd1a5083a/src/cdk/overlay/position/flexible-connected-position-strategy.ts#L805) it is added only once","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28233","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/overlay): fix overlay margin in isBoundedByLeftViewportEdge\" (#28233)"},{"Id":"2024750637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-04T21:12:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28232","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `3069be8` -> `86d34a0` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `6f2e63f` -> `1f792c0` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `2113cd7` -> `3bdb358` |\n\nðŸ”¡ If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Most of the tabs are detached and reattached until the tab is closed.\r\n\r\nThe active tab is determined from the currently active route on each navigation end event. This way if the application is loaded with a specific url, the appropriate tab is selected.\r\n\r\nConsider the following routes:\r\n```\r\n- /tab1\r\n- /tab2\r\n- /tab2/sub1\r\n- /tab2/sub2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the `/tab2` route, another tab group is present with links to the sub routes (and of course a sub router-outlet as well).\r\n\r\nIf we load the app with the `/tabs2/sub2` route, the components of `/tab2` and `/tab2/sub2` are loaded, which also means that the tab2's ink is initialized to the second tab in the header.\r\n\r\nNow, if we navigate to `/tab1`, these components are not destroyed, however the tab link active flags are set to false because neither `/tab2/sub1` nor `/tab2/sub2` is active after the navigation ends.\r\n\r\nThen if we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2`, the components are not reinitialized (because of the reuse strategy). but the active flag is changed for the `/tab2/sub2` tab link (because it is now active after navigation end).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nckgfk?file=src%2Ftab-active-tracker.directive.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n2. Click on Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner tab group loaded [OK]\r\n3. Click on Sub-Tab 1 -> upper Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n4. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> upper Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK]\r\n5. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n6. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], **inner Sub 2 is NOT highlighted [NOK]**\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter the step 6 the ink should be re-initialized even if set to the same value.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the active status is properly set (font is bold on the inner Sub-Tab 2 header element) but the ink is missing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I found the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen we navigate from the `/tab2/sub2` back to `/tab1`, neither the `/tab2/sub1` nor the `/tab2/sub2` routes are active so the `selectedIndex` is set to `-1` and the ink's `hide()` is called. However, the index just set is not processed until the next `ngAfterContentChecked` call.\r\n\r\nNow, when we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2` (which was the last active inner tab) the ink handler thinks that despite the selection index is changed (from `-1` ro `1`), the selection itself is not changed.\r\n\r\nI think that in the `hide()` function of `MatInkBar` the `this._currentItem` should be set to `null`. Because next time when `alignToElement` is called, the `correspondingItem === currentItem` check will be true (but the index was changed from `1 -> -1 -> 1` but it was not processed due to a missing `ngAfterContentChecked` call)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/0762d69b394343555488b5aaada9444dd1a5083a/src/material/tabs/ink-bar.ts#L40\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.5\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.2\r\n@angular/material               17.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTabLink): Underline (MatTabInk) is missing if combined with route reuse strategy\" (#28229)"},{"Id":"2023770717","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-04T12:42:19","Actor":"iosipov27","Number":"28228","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): when using appearance=\"outline\", input fields increases in height.

After a lot of caveats I reached to ng serve it without any error in Angular CLI. Now, as soon as my application launches in browser, I see below provided error.\r\n\r\nI tried different solutions provided by different communities; like; stackoverflow, github etc. but unfortunately no luck so far. I tried below suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Delete node_modules, delete package.lock.json, clear the npm cache, clear the .angular cache, restart VS code, do npm i, ng serve.\r\n- Check for circular dependency in application and resolve it.\r\n- If you are using custom pipe in application, don't mention them in imports of ngModule, mention them in providers.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks a lot !!!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104505925/180841821-5da60c34-bbc5-4908-bb75-23a76c689841.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nzone.js:182 Uncaught Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵmod')\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵmod')\r\n    at getNgModuleDef (core.mjs:1137:1)\r\n    at new NgModuleFactory (core.mjs:21906:1)\r\n    at Compiler.compileModuleSync (core.mjs:25189:1)\r\n    at Compiler.compileModuleAsync (core.mjs:25195:1)\r\n    at router.mjs:3985:43\r\n    at doInnerSub (mergeInternals.js:19:18)\r\n    at outerNext (mergeInternals.js:14:1)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber._next (OperatorSubscriber.js:13:1)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber.next (Subscriber.js:31:1)\r\n    at innerFrom.js:61:28\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1211:1)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:1165:1)\r\n    at zone.js:1278:1\r\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:406:1)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.mjs:25595:1)\r\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:405:1)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone.js:178:1)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone.js:585:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.8        \r\nNode: 16.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104505925/180842139-40d83a89-df05-4dc2-964f-f181d4df2b00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104505925/180842004-3de36c6c-59b5-4e58-95c4-1745f7a27309.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46966","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵmod')\" (#46966)"},{"Id":"1316833813","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-25T14:42:42","Actor":"irisDreizen","Number":"46963","RawContent":null,"Title":"Resolver stop concat operator","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\non version 13 returns a concat observable in a resolver and completes all the given observables.\r\nstarting from version 14.0 after the first observable resolves the concat is stopped.\r\n\r\na way to reproduce:\r\nrun this code in both versions and see the difference:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n    providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class AppResolver implements Resolve<any> {\r\n    resolve(): Observable<any> {\r\n        return concat(\r\n            of('1').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v))), // angular14 will log only this observable \r\n            of('2').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v))),\r\n            of('3').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v))),\r\n            of('4').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v))),\r\n            of('5').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v))),\r\n            of('6').pipe(tap((v) => console.log(v)))\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nworking using -

Of course I could make another observable in my TS file and combineLatest them but this means I would need to that for every scenario in my HTML and it dosent make much sence to combine them in the TS if all I want is to display a loading animation.\r\n\r\nI went trough a few possible solutions and think this could be a standard Angular feature. I'm open for discussions and suggestions but as far as the testing / working of the idea goes it seems to work fine. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose we have a similar async pipe but it would work only for keys of observables, this way you can keep your HTML clean and robust. The following code will recreate an object based on the current one but with the catch that it will map all observables to another object with the returned values from the stream.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"{ myData$, selectedItems$, myPromise$ } | await as props; else loading\">\r\n  <my-multi-selector\r\n    [selectedItems]=\"props.selectedItems$.value\"\r\n    [data]=\"props.myData$.value\"></my-multi-selector>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #loading>\r\n  <div>Loading...</div>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRegarding the implementation I made a sample app which I tested and it seems to work fine. There is a catch to my code and that is that I catch the object and compare references - this is completely fine if you use the code as above written but there is an issue if you e.g. create your object in TS and then dynamically change the keys (adding / removing keys will cause issues without creating a new instance of the object itself).\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by removing the comparison of the references of the new and old object but since this isn't a pure pipe I considered the performance impact and since this would be used only in HTML anyway I think this is the best possible solution - again I'm open for discussion.\r\n\r\nLink of example: https://github.com/muhamedkarajic/angular-playground/blob/main/src/app/shared/pipes/await.pipe.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46948","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"await / async (props) of Observables | Promises etc\" (#46948)"},{"Id":"1315449400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-22T22:04:31","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"46947","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update io_bazel_rules_sass digest to 030f696","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| io_bazel_rules_sass | http_archive | digest | `eda73f6` -> `030f696` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The Angular-Library gets build with `ng build my-lib --watch --configuration development` and gets linked (after successful build) in the Angular-App with the command `npm link ../mylib/dist/my-lib`. So far so good... It works - i can start my app with `ng serve` and and i can use the \"my-lib\" dependencies without any problem. \r\n\r\nIf i now start actively developing in the existing library entry points, my library starts to build again - everything fine so far. But stop! If i take a look into the package.json of my successful build files (inside of dist directory) the package.json version is the same as before. So my App with the active ng-serve does not get any notification of the changes.\r\n\r\nAccording to issue [20962](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20962#issuecomment-863476476) - if i understood it correctly - an Angular Library should \"stamp\" the current build inside of the package.json and update the version with something like: 0.1.2+0123456789. But thats not gonna happen! If i update a component or a module of an existing entry point, Angular does not update the version in the package.json of the dist folder. So the Angular App does not start an active reload, and does not get any information about changes in the library.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.0\",\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: Microsoft Windows 10\r\nAngular 14.0.0\r\n\r\nActual dependencies:\r\n\"@angular/animations\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/common\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/compiler\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/forms\": \"^14.0.0\"\r\n\"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/cli\": \"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^14.0.0\"\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23636","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular library with multiple entry points and npm link\" (#23636)"},{"Id":"1316637665","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-25T10:52:06","Actor":"reduckted","Number":"23635","RawContent":null,"Title":"extract-i18n does not respect the i18nDuplicateTranslation option","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [x] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRunning the `extract-i18n` command will always log duplicate i18n message IDs as warnings, regardless of the value of the `i18nDuplicateTranslation` option in the build target.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis repository can be used to quickly reproduce this bug:\r\nhttps://github.com/reduckted/repro-extract-i18n-duplicates\r\n\r\nOr using this archive:\r\n[repro-extract-i18n-duplicates.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/9180422/repro-extract-i18n-duplicates.zip)\r\n\r\n1.

The focus behavior of the `span` is slightly different from the button we had before.\r\n2. The focus restoration after an edit is finished is currently working by accident. When editing starts, we set `isInteractive = false` on the primary action which clears its `tabindex`. When editing is finished, we reset the flag, but change detection hasn't had the chance to run so the element won't actually have a `tabindex` at the moment when we try to restore focus.

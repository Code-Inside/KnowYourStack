As per error logging this could recover most of customers random import failures, thus they probably barely noticed a failure and it recovered automatically after 2 seconds in the background. I can wrap all my own imports in that function but not the one angular generates.\n\n[From angular.dev](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/defer):\n\n> Angular's compiler produces a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) statement for each component, directive, and pipe used in the `@defer` block\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease allow to masque the imports generated by angular. Or maybe angular itself employs an import retry strategy. As per spec https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6768 sadly browsers cache import failures, so the retry function has to have a build-in cache buster.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPatching angular with yarn.\n\nI doubt - as long as angular uses esbuild - that the bundler will solve this, as this feature request has already been declined via https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2130\n\nWith webpack this issue was a little bit less pressing as at least the failures weren't cached. So the app was able to recover if you continued using it.

I was getting errors with browserslist as they are using CommonJS requires in their code and my library and app were ESM. After removing [browserslist-useragent-regexp](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp), simplifying my library to JS,  and still getting errors, they asked me to reach out to Angular as they were thinking Angular had an over complicated environment.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a shareable config following browserslist's instructions here: https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist?tab=readme-ov-file#shareable-configs\n\n\nHere is my particular example with text changed as it's for a client I'm working with:\n\n**Snippet of application's package.json:**\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n**Here is the library's code for this config:**\n\nindex.js\n\n```js\n\nconst BROWSERSLIST_QUERY = ['defaults'];\nexport default BROWSERSLIST_QUERY;\n\n```\n\nsnippet of package.json\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')\n    at find (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:12:25)\n    at matchBlock (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:46:10)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:73:17\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\n    at parse (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:70:13)\n    at parseQueries (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:454:16)\n    at resolve (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:322:10)\n    at Function.select (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:1163:14)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:332:29\n    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.8\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.7\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                    19.2.8\n@schematics/angular             19.2.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Type error between Angular CLI and Browserslist when extending a browserslist config\" (#30183)"},{"Id":"3020569646","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T16:56:08","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30182","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] build: rename npm2 to npm as rules_nodejs based npm workspace has been removed","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30182","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[PATCH] build: rename npm2 to npm as rules_nodejs based npm workspace has been removed\" (#30182)"},{"Id":"3020562363","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T16:52:27","Actor":"Wartijn","Number":"30181","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reference to tsconfig.spec.json created in new app with --minimal flag","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n\n### Description\n\nWhen running `npx @angular/cli@next new `  (currently `@angular/cli@20.0.0-next.8` ) with the --minimal flag, the references array in tsconfig.json contains ` {\"path\": \"./tsconfig.spec.json\"}`,  which doesn't exist.\n\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.

See the example defining of paths mapping:\n* example nx `project.json` (but can be `angular.json` ) in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/projects/storefrontapp/project.json#L10-L14\n* example `extra-webpack.config.js` in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/extra-webpack.config.js#L24-L79\n\n**Problem after migrating to esbuild application builder:**\nAfter migrating to the new Angular `application` builder, which is based on esbuild, such a paths mapping no longer works (even when passing analogical custom plugin e.g. via the 3rd party `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild:application`). \n\nNote: we tried passing a custom plugin to [`buildApplication()`'s 3rd argument `extensions.codePlugins`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L152-L155), but it didn't affect the SCSS paths resolution.  Maybe we did something wrong. I guess it's becasue the styles plugins defined in the array below don't take the ambient `extensions.codePlugins` into account. See the source code of Angular CLI:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66\n\nNote 2: I understand that `buildApplication()` has a JSDoc comment [\"@experimental Direct usage of this function is considered experimental.\"](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L145). That said, I'm still hoping we can help improve this function with our feedback, so it addresses needs of authors of custom Angular libraries developed in monorepos.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be nice to be able to inject into `buildApplication()` custom plugins affecting SCSS paths resolution e.g. into the [`plugins` array](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66) in `..../tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts`.\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWorkaround ideas:\nOur ultimate goal is to keep our example app in our monorepo working. And publish our libs so their consumers can import them and it should work in their apps.\n\nSo alternatively we can keep relative paths in our monorepo (e.g. `@import '*lib-b*/....' `. And as a post-build step of a production build of an Angular library (with ng-packgr) we could search-replace with a regex in the /dist folder all the cross-library scss import paths to relevant \"symbolic\" paths (.e.g `@import *@my-org/lib-b*/...`.\nThanks to this, the example app in our monorepo using relative paths would still work (no need for paths mapping in the `application` builder). And users of our libraries would get shipped SCSS sources which are cross-importing other libs' styles via symbolic paths, which will resolve successfully (using their `node_modules/*@my-org/lib-b*/...` )\nThe downside of it is that our example app in our monorepo would differ from our user's apps - which would be a bit confusing to read (and ambigious to diffrentiate it from non-cross-lib other relative imports from inside the same library itself).\n\nNote: I've found a related issue https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23552 but it's old and related to the webpack builder, where workaround with custom webpack plugin was possible. I've created this issue for the purpose of `application` builder, where I hope we could add an API for injecting a custom plugin affecting SCSS (e.g. for a custom paths mapping).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In application builder allow for custom styles plugins, e.g. for SCSS paths mapping needed in monorepo with many libraries\" (#30180)"},{"Id":"3020154198","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T13:59:55","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30179","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: rename npm2 to npm as rules_nodejs based npm workspace has been removed","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30179","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: rename npm2 to npm as rules_nodejs based npm workspace has been removed\" (#30179)"},{"Id":"3019153360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T08:14:20","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30176","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): ensure `com.chrome.devtools.json` is consistently served after initial run","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nPreviously, `com.chrome.devtools.json` was generated and served correctly on the first run, but subsequent `ng serve` runs failed to serve the file unless the Angular cache was cleared.

So the tests still run back to back, but as separate commands vs a single call to \"ng test\", which is what makes me think to look at \"ng test\" for a fix.\n\nWe found this in our build pipeline when upgrading our pipeline agents from Ubuntu 22.04 to 24.04 recently.\nThe single call to \"ng test\" works great on Ubuntu 22.04 and fails every time at the second project on Ubuntu 24.04.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nFirst create an Angular multi-project workspace, eg with a library project and a demo/test SPA, each one with a test build type using karma configured to run against chrome-headless.\n\nRelevant bits from angular.json:\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"client-app\": {\n      \"projectType\": \"application\",\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"test\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",\n..\n    \"template-forms\": {\n      \"projectType\": \"library\",\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"test\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",\n...\n\nrelevant packages:\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^18.2.14\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^18.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^18.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^18.2.13\",\n  ...\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^18.2.18\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^18.2.18\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^18.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"^18.2.13\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"^4.6.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"karma\": \"^6.4.4\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"^2.2.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"^5.1.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"karma-junit-reporter\": \"^2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-viewport\": \"^1.0.9\",\n    \"puppeteer\": \"^22.15.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"^10.9.2\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.4.5\"\n\nFor each project define the tests, then use \"ng test\" to run all tests back to back on Ubuntu 24.04.\nThe tests for the first project it runs will work.\nWhen trying to start running the second set of tests it will fail to start chromium with the following error:\n\n----- snip -----\n24 04 2025 17:28:54.068:INFO [karma-server]: Karma v6.4.4 server started at http://localhost:9876/\n24 04 2025 17:28:54.071:INFO [launcher]: Launching browsers ChromeHeadless with concurrency unlimited\n24 04 2025 17:28:54.077:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser ChromeHeadless\n24 04 2025 17:28:54.640:ERROR [launcher]: Cannot start ChromeHeadless\n\t[0424/172854.240339:FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(126)] No usable sandbox!

To use the browser support, either `playwright` or `webdriverio` must be installed within the project. On startup, the testing process will automatically attempt to discover the browser provider. The browser names present in the `browsers` option must be specified based on the installed provider. Each may have differing names for some browsers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30168","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/build): add experimental vitest browser support to unit-testing\" (#30168)"},{"Id":"3012950651","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T06:26:40","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30154","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/ssr): return 302 when redirectTo is a function","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure the server returns a 302 status code and sets the correct 'Location' header when the redirectTo value is a function, aligning with expected HTTP redirect behavior.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/ssr): return 302 when redirectTo is a function\" (#30154)"},{"Id":"3014940448","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:54:20","Actor":"Manikandan-LakshmananA","Number":"30167","RawContent":null,"Title":"This issue is related to the Angular core lifecycle handling (@angular/core), specifically in nested component","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nadd\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe’re using a grid component structure that includes both ColumnDirective elements and an array-based column configuration. We’ve observed a discrepancy in component destruction behavior between Array-based columns and Complex column directives.\n\nFor array-based configurations, the component destruction lifecycle (ngOnDestroy) executes correctly, and the isDestroyed flag is set as expected.\n\nFor directive-based column definitions (nested components via ColumnDirective), the component destruction is not occurring as expected. The **ngOnDestroy** method is not triggered reliably for **nested directive** components, and as a result, we are unable to track or respond to destruction state changes.\n\nWe’ve provided a StackBlitz sample and a screenshot to illustrate the issue:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20ce3e09-4882-4d36-af6a-51a4f2f0789a)\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23093efb-7dcb-4599-b6d5-667caa85d148)\n\nsample : https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ejs-grid-aggregates-xegsuxcp?file=app.component.html,app.component.ts,app%2Fapp.module.ts\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nCreate a grid with nested ColumnDirective usage.\n\nModify or remove a column dynamically (e.g., uncheck a checkbox controlling visibility).\n\nObserve the behavior in lifecycle hooks like ngOnDestroy in nested components.\n\nCompare this with similar actions in array-based column definitions.\n\nActual Behavior :\n\nIn array-based columns: ngOnDestroy() is called correctly, and destruction is clean.\n\nIn complex column directives: destruction is not triggered, and the isDestroyed state is never updated.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nNested directive-based components (e.g., ColumnDirective) should also invoke ngOnDestroy() properly when removed from the DOM or destroyed via dynamic updates. The isDestroyed flag should be updated to allow consistent tracking.\n\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nCreate a grid with nested ColumnDirective usage.\n\nModify or remove a column dynamically (e.g., uncheck a checkbox controlling visibility).\n\nObserve the behavior in lifecycle hooks like ngOnDestroy in nested components.\n\nCompare this with similar actions in array-based column definitions.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nExpected Behavior:\n\nNested directive-based components (e.g., ColumnDirective) should also invoke ngOnDestroy() properly when removed from the DOM or destroyed via dynamic updates.

Manually moving @schematics/angular to the top restores the expected behavior:\n```\n\"cli\": {\n  \"schematicCollections\": [\n    \"@cypress/schematic\",\n    \"@angular-eslint/schematics\",\n    \"@schematics/angular\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nTo:\n```\n\"cli\": {\n  \"schematicCollections\": [\n    \"@schematics/angular\",\n    \"@cypress/schematic\",\n    \"@angular-eslint/schematics\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nThere is an open issue in the [Cypress repository (#25875)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25875) describing this same behavior. However, it seems that no fix has been implemented there yet, and the problem continues to affect developers relying on Angular CLI configurations.\n\n### Expected behavior\nCLI-generated components

This results in a disabled scrollbar being shown in the app.\n\nAs a workaround, apps in this situation should ensure that they remove content they want to hide & wait for that change to be rendered in the DOM before launching the dialog.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30943","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): scroll blocking overlay persists when documentElement shrinks to the point it is not needed\" (#30943)"},{"Id":"3014712508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:17:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30940","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package","State":"closed","Body":"Note: this is the second attempt to merge this change, it now includes a fix for the documentation site which can be verified with the preview deployment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30940","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package\" (#30940)"},{"Id":"3014574843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:17:10","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30935","RawContent":null,"Title":" Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package","State":"closed","Body":"Note: this is the second attempt to merge this change, it now includes a fix for the documentation site which can be verified with the preview deployment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30935","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \" Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package\" (#30935)"},{"Id":"3014377743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:13:12","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30932","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/listbox): add cdk-active class","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30932","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/listbox): add cdk-active class\" (#30932)"},{"Id":"3014717485","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T17:09:49","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30941","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.\" (#30941)"},{"Id":"3014682769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:55:28","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30939","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release\" (#30939)"},{"Id":"3014678279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:51:41","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.\" (#30938)"},{"Id":"3014643488","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:43:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30937","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30937","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments\" (#30937)"},{"Id":"3014600091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:30:32","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30936","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30936","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update public dir for docs preview deployments\" (#30936)"},{"Id":"3014554691","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:19:05","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30934","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: setup preview docs service","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30934","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: setup preview docs service\" (#30934)"},{"Id":"3014474891","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T15:40:19","Actor":"mrbreck","Number":"30933","RawContent":null,"Title":"Timepicker ignores provided moment adapter","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTimepicker is either not using the provided moment adapter or is ignoring the \"useUtc\" setting.

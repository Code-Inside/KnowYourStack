{"Data":{"Angular-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2781447211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-11T00:01:48","Actor":"hammad-awan","Number":"59478","RawContent":null,"Title":"@if @else (or *ngIf) issue and change detection","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI have a component that has conditional logic using an @if (or *ngIf) condition on a flag, e.g., @if (model.editable) or <ngContainer *ngIf=\"model.editable\"...>, in its html file, which displays one set of controls for the true condition and another for false.\n\nIn ngOnChanges in the typescript file I call a service method that returns the model which has multiple properties including editable. The other properties are bound to various different control properties, e.g., <input [value]=\"model.wbsNumber\" ...>.\n\napp-field-dropdown and app-field-text-input are components that implement ControlValueAccessor and wrap existing HTML elements like selects or inputs and add additional functionality. The value property on app-field-text-input is just a passthrough to the value property on the underlying input control.\n\nIf the @Input value to the component changes and triggers the code in ngOnChanges to retrieve a new model from the server and the model.editable property changes, e.g., from true to false or vice versa, I seem to have binding issues where control values are not being updated and reflecting the correct values, i.e., model.wbsNumber is not being set on the input control. This doesn't happen if the model.editable property does not change when ngOnChanges is triggered. The values are updated correctly in the ui.\n\nI'm sure it has to do with dynamic control construction due to the @if, but I am at a loss as to why it does not work and how to get it so that the controls reflect the correct values in the ui.\n\nOne thing that helps the display as part of the first @if condition, i.e., model?.editable, is if I change this.ngModelGroup.reset(this.model) to setTimeout(() => this.ngModelGroup.reset(this.model), 50) for some reason. But this doesn't work for the @else condition because those controls are just one-way data-bound through the value properties.  So the setTimeout call is hinting at something, but I don't know what.\n\n```\n@if (model?.editable) {\n<ng-container ngModelGroup=\"wbs\">\n    <app-field-dropdown #wbsProgram\n                        id=\"project-wbs-wbsProgramId\"\n                        name=\"wbsProgramId\"\n                        [field]=\"PMBField.ProjectSummaryProgram\"\n                        [required]=\"true\"\n                        [options]=\"wbsPrograms\"\n                        (change)=\"getWbsChildren(wbsProgram.name)\"\n                        ngModel />\n\n   <!--Other controls-->\n</ng-container>\n}\n@else {\n<app-field-text-input id=\"project-wbs-wbsProgramName\"\n                      [field]=\"PMBField.ProjectSummaryProgram\"\n                      [readonly]=\"true\"\n                      [value]=\"model?.wbsProgramName\" />\n\n<!--Other controls-->\n}\n\n```\n\n    @ViewChild(NgModelGroup) ngModelGroup: NgModelGroup | undefined;\n\n    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n        if (changes[\"projectId\"]?.previousValue !== this.projectId) {\n            if (this.projectId) {\n                this._projectWbsService.getProjectWbs({ request: this.projectId.id }).subscribe(response => {\n                    this.model = response;\n                    if (this.model.editable) {\n                        // Other code...\n\n                        this.ngModelGroup?.reset(this.model);\n                       // Mostly works if I replace above with:\n                       setTimeout(() => this.ngModelGroup?.reset(this.model), 50);\n                   }\n            });\n            } else {\n                this.model = undefined;\n                // Other code...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59478","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@if @else (or *ngIf) issue and change detection\" (#59478)"},{"Id":"2781431914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-10T23:45:15","Actor":"sandeepsalwan1","Number":"59477","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typos in .vscode/README.md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3.11\n\n### Description\n\n**Background:**\nI dynamically load prebuild webcomponents (separate project / pkg using @angular/elements) in an Angular 19 Application.\nThese webcomponents are defined in assets-Configuration pointing to the respective package in node_modules.\n\n**Problem**\nWhen locally starting the Angular 19 Application (`build-angular:dev-server`), these dynamically loaded javascript assets are being transformed (by Vite I suppose) and hence an error occurs:\n\n```js\nmain.js Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\n```\n\nℹ  All non Dev-Server related cases work flawlessly.\nℹ  With Angular 17 the problem did not occur\n\nThe transformation, among other things, adds import statements (for some of the applications chunks).\n\nserve config\n```\n    \"serve\": {\n      \"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"buildTarget\":

js-file.\n\n```\n        \"assets\": [\n          {\n            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n            \"input\": \"node_modules/@demo-wc/some-webcomponent\",\n            \"output\":

default Sunday as the first day of week for any locale","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the Luxon date adapter, the first day of the week is always set to Sunday, regardless of the selected locale. However, in certain locales (e.g., French), the first day of the week should be Monday. This behavior can cause inconsistencies in applications relying on localized date formats.\n\nTo address this issue, we can provide custom options for the Luxon date adapter by using a factory function. This factory dynamically calculates the correct firstDayOfWeek based on the current locale, leveraging Luxon’s Info.getStartOfWeek method.\n\nHere's how to configure it:\n\n```ts\nimport { MAT_LUXON_DATE_ADAPTER_OPTIONS } from '@angular/material-luxon-adapter';\nimport { MAT_DATE_LOCALE } from '@angular/material/core';\nimport { Info } from 'luxon';\nimport { inject } from '@angular/core';\n\n{\n  provide: MAT_LUXON_DATE_ADAPTER_OPTIONS,\n  useFactory: () => {\n    const locale = inject<string>(MAT_DATE_LOCALE); // Retrieve the current locale\n    const firstDayOfWeek = Info.getStartOfWeek({ locale }); // Get the first day of the week for the locale\n    return { firstDayOfWeek };\n  },\n},\n```\n\nLuxon relies on the Intl.Locale.prototype.getWeekInfo API to determine the first day of the week. Unfortunately, this API is not supported in Firefox (as of now). However, Luxon includes a fallback mechanism that assumes Monday as the first day of the week, which aligns with the ISO standard.\n\nFor more details on getWeekInfo, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/getWeekInfo).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/gao3m1fm?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdatepicker-overview-example.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open date picker and see that \"D\" (\"Dimanche\" aka. Sunday) is the first day of the week which is invalid as LOCAL_ID is \"fr\"\n2. Uncomment the last provider in `bootstrapApplication`\n3. Open date picker and see that \"L\" (\"Lundi\" aka. Monday) is the correct first day\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFirst day of week should depends on selected locale.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe first day of the week is always set to Sunday, regardless of the selected locale.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.5\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.4\n- Browser(s): Chrome 131.0.6778.205 (64 bits)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30278","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(datepicker): Luxon date adapter consider by default Sunday as the first day of week for any locale\" (#30278)"},{"Id":"2774748142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T08:12:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30285","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-luxon-adapter): infer first day of week from locale","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the Luxon date adapter was hardcoding the first day of the week to Sunday, unless it's provided through DI.\r\n\r\nFixes #30278.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30285","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material-luxon-adapter): infer first day of week from locale\" (#30285)"},{"Id":"2776971305","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T06:54:33","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30296","RawContent":null,"Title":"Testing","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30296","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Testing\" (#30296)"},{"Id":"2776384121","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-08T22:36:12","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"30294","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v19.2.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the release-candidate phase.

with strictTemplates option on, I get numerous errors in templates about the attributes.\r\n\r\nMy point in this issue is that when I have `<some-component [size]=\"size\"/>` with the `size` attribute defined as: `@Input() size: string = DEFAULT_SIZE;` for example, I get the following error: \"_TS2322: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'_\".\r\n\r\nBut Angular converts undefined values to the default value in such case, that's the point of the whole mechanism.\r\nI workaround the problem with `<some-component [size]=\"size!\"/>` but it doesn't feel right.\r\nIt worked before (v. 14), because the template compiler was less strict?\r\n\r\nCan Angular template compiler detect such cases and avoid this error?\r\nThanks.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

This also includes whitespaces and comment nodes that Angular produces during the rendering on the server. Those whitespaces and nodes must be present in the HTML generated by the server-side rendering process. This is also documented at: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#constraints.\r\n\r\nIn practice, some CDNs ([example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/auto-minify/)) have mechanisms to remove all comment nodes and spaces from all text nodes from HTML while serving the content (there are also cases where this type of optimization is performed at the build step). Those mechanisms are frequently enabled by default. This leads to situations where an application worked in dev mode correctly, but started failing in production. Since the production code is also minified, it makes it hard to look at the stack trace and identify the origin of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis feature requests proposes that we add a special detection mechanism for such cases. For example, we can do the following:\r\n\r\n- on the server, while serializing DOM, add a comment node to a well known location (e.g. as a first node in the `<body>`)\r\n- on the client (both in dev and prod modes), before starting hydration process, verify the presence of those \"marker\" nodes and throw an error if they are not present\r\n- we should also add an error guide for this error, so that the link to the guide is present in production mode\r\n\r\nOne of the examples where this issue becomes a hard-to-debug problem: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50133#issuecomment-1535713053","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51160","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hydration: detect when index.html is altered between the server and the client\" (#51160)"},{"Id":"1819024480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-24T19:41:43","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"51158","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Provide a diagnostic for negated `AsyncPipe` in ngIf expressions","State":"open","Body":"Negating an `AsyncPipe` in an `*ngIf` thrashes the layout because the pipe emits null immediately before checking the condition.

This causes ES Modules in the output with non-configurable methods/properties. As a result, we cannot mock JS modules. This leads to tests that pull lots of external dependencies (utility functions, config objects etc.) that are not provided using the DI and hence cannot be stubbed using Angular DI.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nScaffold an app and use Jest as a testing tool. Modify AppComponent.ngOnInit\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  if (isDevMode())  {\r\n    console.log('dev');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the test try to stub the `isDevMode`.\r\n\r\n```\r\njest.mock('@angular/core', () => ({\r\n    ...jest.requireActual('@angular/core'),\r\n    isDevMode: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(false)\r\n}))\r\n\r\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\r\n    let component: AppComponent;\r\n\r\n    beforeEach(() => {\r\n        component = new AppComponent()\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    describe('ngOnInit', () => {\r\n        it('should not log when in prod mode', () => {\r\n            const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log')\r\n            component.ngOnInit()\r\n            expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled()\r\n        });\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nTest fail due to a number of reasons which are related to ES Build in the end:\r\na. ES Build outputs a module with a different name and there is a mismatch\r\nb. ES Build embeds a module (e.g. import of the environments file)\r\nc. JS runtime error that you try to change the property that cannot be configurable. This happens if you try to import the module in the tests and spy on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nimport * as module from 'module'\r\n\r\njest.spyOnProperty(module, 'method').mockReturnValue(...)\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.0.5\r\nNode: 18.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1600.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         16.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   16.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          16.0.5 (cli-only)\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis feels like a big deal, because most of the current state tests will become invalid.

CSS nesting allows selectors to be used where declarations are expected. There's an IE7 hack where prefixing a declaration with a `*` causes that declaration to only be applied in IE7 due to a bug in IE7's CSS parser. However, it's valid for nested CSS selectors to start with `*`. So esbuild was incorrectly parsing these declarations and anything following it up until the next `{` as a selector for a nested CSS rule. This release changes esbuild's parser to terminate the parsing of selectors for nested CSS rules when a `;` is encountered to fix this edge case:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%; height: 1px; {\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that the syntax for CSS nesting is [about to change again](https://togithub.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7961), so esbuild's CSS parser may still not be completely accurate with how browsers do and/or will interpret CSS nesting syntax. Expect additional updates to esbuild's CSS parser in the future to deal with upcoming CSS specification changes.\n\n-   Adjust esbuild's warning about undefined imports for TypeScript `import` equals declarations ([#&#8203;3271](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3271))\n\n    In JavaScript, accessing a missing property on an import namespace object is supposed to result in a value of `undefined` at run-time instead of an error at compile-time. This is something that esbuild warns you about by default because doing this can indicate a bug with your code. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    console.log(styles.buton)\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    // styles.js\n    export let button = {}\n    ```\n\n    If you bundle `app.js` with esbuild you will get this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Import \"buton\" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in \"styles.js\" [import-is-undefined]\n\n            app.js:2:19:\n              2 │ console.log(styles.buton)\n                │                    ~~~~~\n                ╵                    button\n\n          Did you mean to import \"button\" instead?\n\n            styles.js:1:11:\n              1 │ export let button = {}\n                ╵            ~~~~~~\n\n    However, there is TypeScript-only syntax for `import` equals declarations that can represent either a type import (which esbuild should ignore) or a value import (which esbuild should respect). Since esbuild doesn't have a type system, it tries to only respect `import` equals declarations that are actually used as values. Previously esbuild always generated this warning for unused imports referenced within `import` equals declarations even when the reference could be a type instead of a value. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only warn in this case if the import is actually used. Here is an example of some code that no longer causes an incorrect warning:\n\n    ```ts\n    // app.ts\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    import ButtonType = styles.Button\n    ```\n\n    ```ts\n    // styles.ts\n    export interface Button {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.62`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n### [`v23.0.61`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n### [`v23.0.60`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v1.32.1...v1.33.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.18.16`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01816)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.15...v0.18.16)\n\n-   Fix a regression with whitespace inside `:is()` ([#&#8203;3265](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3265))\n\n    The change to parse the contents of `:is()` in version 0.18.14 introduced a regression that incorrectly flagged the contents as a syntax error if the contents started with a whitespace token (for example `div:is( .foo ) {}`). This regression has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.18.15`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01815)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.14...v0.18.15)\n\n-   Add the `--serve-fallback=` option ([#&#8203;2904](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2904))\n\n    The web server built into esbuild serves the latest in-memory results of the configured build. If the requested path doesn't match any in-memory build result, esbuild also provides the `--servedir=` option to tell esbuild to serve the requested path from that directory instead. And if the requested path doesn't match either of those things, esbuild will either automatically generate a directory listing (for directories) or return a 404 error.\n\n    Starting with this release, that last step can now be replaced with telling esbuild to serve a specific HTML file using the `--serve-fallback=` option. This can be used to provide a \"not found\" page for missing URLs. It can also be used to implement a [single-page app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that mutates the current URL and therefore requires the single app entry point to be served when the page is loaded regardless of whatever the current URL is.\n\n-   Use the `tsconfig` field in `package.json` during `extends` resolution ([#&#8203;3247](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3247))\n\n    This release adds a feature from [TypeScript 3.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages) where if a `tsconfig.json` file specifies a package name in the `extends` field and that package's `package.json` file has a `tsconfig` field, the contents of that field are used in the search for the base `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n-   Implement CSS nesting without `:is()` when possible ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Previously esbuild would always produce a warning when transforming nested CSS for a browser that doesn't support the `:is()` pseudo-class. This was because the nesting transform needs to generate an `:is()` in some complex cases which means the transformed CSS would then not work in that browser. However, the CSS nesting transform can often be done without generating an `:is()`. So with this release, esbuild will no longer warn when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()` in the cases where an `:is()` isn't needed to represent the nested CSS.\n\n    In addition, esbuild's nested CSS transform has been updated to avoid generating an `:is()` in cases where an `:is()` is preferable but there's a longer alternative that is also equivalent. This update means esbuild can now generate a combinatorial explosion of CSS for complex CSS nesting syntax when targeting browsers that don't support `:is()`. This combinatorial explosion is necessary to accurately represent the original semantics. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .first,\n    .second,\n    .third {\n      & > & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    :is(.first, .second, .third) > :is(.first, .second, .third) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .first > .first,\n    .first > .second,\n    .first > .third,\n    .second > .first,\n    .second > .second,\n    .second > .third,\n    .third > .first,\n    .third > .second,\n    .third > .third {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This change means you can now use CSS nesting with esbuild when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`. You'll now only get a warning from esbuild if you use complex CSS nesting syntax that esbuild can't represent in that older browser without using `:is()`. There are two such cases:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    a b {\n      .foo & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a {\n      > b& {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    These two cases still need to use `:is()`, both for different reasons, and cannot be used when targeting an older browser that doesn't support `:is()`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Case 1 */\n    .foo :is(a b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Case 2 */\n    a > a:is(b) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically lower `inset` in CSS for older browsers\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically expand the `inset` property to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties when esbuild's `target` is set to a browser that doesn't support `inset`:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      inset: 10px 20px;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome80) */\n    .app {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 10px;\n      right: 20px;\n      bottom: 10px;\n      left: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add support for the new [`@starting-style`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/#defining-before-change-style-the-starting-style-rule) CSS rule ([#&#8203;3249](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3249))\n\n    This at rule allow authors to start CSS transitions on first style update. That is, you can now make the transition take effect when the `display` property changes from `none` to `block`.\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;starting-style {\n      h1 {\n        background-color: transparent;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Output */\n    @&#8203;starting-style{h1{background-color:transparent}}\n    ```\n\n    This was contributed by

error.\n\n### [`v1.64.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1640)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.63.6...1.64.0)\n\n-   Comments that appear before or between `@use` and `@forward` rules are now\n    emitted in source order as much as possible, instead of always being emitted\n    after the CSS of all module dependencies.\n\n-   Fix a bug where an interpolation in a custom property name crashed if the file\n    was loaded by a `@use` nested in an `@import`.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Add a new `SassCalculation` type that represents the calculation objects added\n    in Dart Sass 1.40.0.\n\n-   Add `Value.assertCalculation()`, which returns the value if it's a\n    `SassCalculation` and throws an error otherwise.\n\n-   Produce a better error message when an environment that supports some Node.js\n    APIs loads the browser entrypoint but attempts to access the filesystem.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Fix a bug where nested relative `@imports` failed to load when using the\n    deprecated functions `render` or `renderSync` and those relative imports were\n    loaded multiple times across different files.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.19.2`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5192)\n\n[Compare

Its support for passing multiple entry points is especially interesting.\r\n\r\nScenario: I'm building a regular old website (MPA), documentation for a component library. There are over 100 components, with each multiple examples that I'd like to run live on the site.\r\nThe documentation site is not an Angular SPA, but set up via a \"markdown -> static site\" generator ([mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nExpose the internal application builder function, allowing me to build the entire documentation with multiple entry-points—each with its own bootstrap—in one go.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default createBuilder((input, context) =>\r\n\tbuildApplicationInternal( // <-- using internal import here\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\twatch: false,\r\n\t\t\tprogress: false,\r\n\r\n\t\t\tindex: false,\r\n\t\t\tentryPoints: collectEntryPoints(context),\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// more options\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcontext,\r\n\t),\r\n);\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPast solutions for our documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Make the documentation a regular angular app. That's how we started out, turns out no one likes writing documentation like this.\r\n2. Copy the aio setup from angular/angular and make our own \"markdown pages -> angular app\" pipeline. Tried that, but the setup of aio is&hellip; not the easiest to understand or maintain if you're not used to it.\r\n3. Use storybook. That's where we're currently at.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to exposing the internal application builder function:\r\n\r\n4. Build every page into a separate angular app. This makes the build prohibitively slow.\r\n5. Build a single angular app with bootstraps for every documentation page. This would either load all code for all pages for any page, or it would require quite a lot of shenanigans to ensure we don't load all that superfluous javascript over a shabby internal corporate proxy server.\r\n6. Make the multiple entry points available in the existing experimental application builder's schema. For me this solution would work equally well, but I believe the use case (running angular in an MPA) to be so different from what a regular angular app looks like that adding the option will only lead to confusion for developers who just want to build SPAs.\r\n7. Make a separate \"MPA application\" builder. This puts the onus on the angular team to properly support building Angular MPAs, which I don't expect to align with the goals of the framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose internal application builder function\" (#25556)"},{"Id":"1810397018","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-18T20:10:11","Actor":"HerRA17","Number":"25554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Trying to use ng command and I get this two sort of errors: npm ERR!

the same ID","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there seem to be no simple way to connect various drop lists in various components, unless they have a `cdkDropListGroup` on top of them, or a defined list of ids, which is not achievable in many cases.\r\n\r\nHence we could imagine that the `connectedTo` input could be used to connect several lists, depending on a single  `id` parameter (or maybe some `groupName` ?), like : \r\n\r\n```\r\n// In some place in the code\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n...\r\n// In a completely different place\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n...\r\n// In another completely different place\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListConnectedTo=\"someListId\" id=\"someListId\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the Input `connectedTo` already supports an ID as `string` but gets only a single element, as it can be seen in the code : \r\n```\r\nconst siblings = coerceArray(this.connectedTo).map(drop => {\r\n        if (typeof drop === 'string') {\r\n            const correspondingDropList = CdkDropList._dropLists.find(list => list.id === drop); <-- Here\r\n\r\n          if (!correspondingDropList && (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode)) {\r\n            console.warn(`CdkDropList could not find connected drop list with id \"${drop}\"`);\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          return correspondingDropList!;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return drop;\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence replacing `.find(list => list.id === drop)` by a `.filter(list => list.id === drop)` pipe will allow to register as siblings all the lists that have this ID, so it may not be a big deal technically (in first approximation).\r\n\r\n

The problem is that we weren't accounting for `preventDefault` which can block some keys from being assigned and some events from firing. This leads to inconsistencies between tests and the sequence of events triggered by a user. It is especially noticeable in components like the chip input where some keys act as separators.\r\n\r\nThese changes update the logic to take `preventDefault` into account and try to mimic the native event sequence as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nFixes #27475.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27483","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/testing): account for preventDefault in keyboard events\" (#27483)"},{"Id":"1813636972","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-20T10:13:11","Actor":"lukasma","Number":"27484","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-slide-toggle): Incorrect accent dark theme color","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe accent colors for `mat-slide-toggle` were overriden by random colors:\r\n\r\n![slide-toggle-random-dark-theme-colors](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/27922584/0dd162c2-f8fd-489a-a8c3-3ac351f319be)\r\n![slide-toggle-overriden-dark-theme-colors](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/27922584/fde5ff46-dc54-4e76-8e94-7a4d31267692)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Once I managed to run `ng test` successfully (as in: the tests are extecuted), I noticed that 3 tests failed. I fixed 2 of them (we can discuss the reasons of their failure in the PR once it's up as I think it's unrelated to what I'll be describing here), but I can't seem to resolve the 3th test (which I will describe in the reproduction steps below). I noticed that the code to support the macro tasks isn't working properly anymore.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is an issue with Angular or an issue with ZoneJS. Maybe it's not even an issue and we can fix this easily by updating the docs' tests. In that case I'll be happy to fix it as part of the PR I'm finishing.\r\n\r\nAs I noticed @JiaLiPassion created this test initially (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/21669), and, if I remember correctly, also added this functionality into zonejs, I wanted to check if you might have any idea what has been changed in zonejs that would break this test?\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction (issue in the docs)\r\n- Open the Angular repo locally\r\n- checkout master\r\n- cd into aio and run `yarn build`\r\n- cd into `aio/content/examples/testing` and run `yarn test`\r\n\r\n3 tests should fail. You can ignore the `No test scheduler initialized` for now, I've managed to resolve this locally by patching the exampleZipper but this issue is only about the one that's failing with the following message:\r\n```\r\nchrome 74.0.3729 (Linux 0.0.0) CanvasComponent should be able to generate blob data from canvas FAILED\r\n    Error: Expected undefined to be greater than 0.\r\n        at <Jasmine>\r\n        at UserContext.<anonymous> (src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts:24:26)\r\n        at UserContext.<anonymous> (home/frederik/Development/github/frederikprijck/angular/aio/tools/examples/shared/node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-testing.js:1493:1)\r\n        at ZoneDelegate.invoke (home/frederik/Development/github/frederikprijck/angular/aio/tools/examples/shared/node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-evergreen.js:359:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction (underlying issue isolated from the docs)\r\nAs it was easier for me to swap dependency versions to find the issue, I isolated the issue in an empty cli project:\r\n- Create a new @angular/cli 8 project\r\n- Add this component https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/aio/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts and this test https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/aio/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts to the project\r\n- run `ng test`\r\n\r\nThe tests should fail with:\r\n```\r\nchrome 74.0.3729 (Linux 0.0.0) CanvasComponent should be able to generate blob data from canvas FAILED\r\n    Error: Expected undefined to be greater than 0.\r\n        at <Jasmine>\r\n        at UserContext.<anonymous> (src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts:24:26)\r\n        at UserContext.<anonymous> (home/frederik/Development/github/frederikprijck/angular/aio/tools/examples/shared/node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-testing.js:1493:1)\r\n        at ZoneDelegate.invoke (home/frederik/Development/github/frederikprijck/angular/aio/tools/examples/shared/node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-evergreen.js:359:1)\r\n```\r\nIf we do the same, but for an @angular/cli 7 project, the test works fine.\r\nOnce we upgrade `zone` to `0.9.1` (which is the version used when using `@angular/cli` 8) in an Angular 7 project, the tests fail. \r\n\r\nIt's also broken with zone.js `0.9.0` but works fine with `0.8.29`.\r\n\r\nThis might be a regression in zonejs, however I'm not that familiar with zonejs so I was hoping to hear @JiaLiPassion 's opinion on this.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nTest is not succeeding.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\nI've tested this with Angular 7 and 8, on Linux (Elementary OS) and Windows 10.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30939","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(aio): Testing example app doesn't work since Angular 8\" (#30939)"},{"Id":"453933024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-09T20:00:03","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"30938","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): handle empty bindings in template type checker","State":"open","Body":"\r\n**refactor(compiler): tighten `AstVisitor` types**\r\n\r\nPreviously, an `EmptyExpr` node was not reported to `AstVisitor`,\r\nwhich resulted in silently converting it into `undefined` during\r\nAST transforms.

The new length is only correct in the `ngAfterViewChecked()` event, but then it is too late to make any view changes. If the length of any of the QueryLists changes during the change detection cycle, it seems to me that another cycle should be run automatically. I can manually check for this and use `setTimeout()` to run another cycle, but this smells hacky. I think another cycle should be automatic.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-uj7lnn\r\n\r\nIn the stackblitz, if you uncomment out the noted line in `ngAfterViewChecked()` or if you click the `run change detection` button, the count in the console is correct.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.2\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ViewChildren QueryList should run change detection when count changes\" (#30922)"},{"Id":"453606608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T16:54:48","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"30921","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): WIP","State":"open","Body":"Just in case I get hit by a meteor during the weekend.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): WIP\" (#30921)"},{"Id":"453594188","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T16:21:41","Actor":"ocombe","Number":"30920","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): correctly set `TView.firstChild` with runtime i18n","State":"open","Body":"`TView.firstChild` was defined as the first node with index 0, but when we use runtime i18n then the instruction `i18nStart` can be the one with index 0 and the first node will be index 1 or more.\r\nWith this fix we set `TView.firstChild` when we see the first node with index 0 or later if `TView.firstChild` is still null.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30920","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): correctly set `TView.firstChild` with runtime i18n\" (#30920)"},{"Id":"453469744","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T15:53:47","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"30914","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ngcc - remove unused import to make linting pass","State":"closed","Body":"The failure is caused by 65f20107f.

I didn't use AOT for dev mode serving previously because it wasn't as performant as it is now in Ivy.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe [Ivy Guide](https://angular.io/guide/ivy) suggests enabling `\"aot\": true` for dev mode builds.\r\n\r\nWhat I’m finding during that experience is that while the rebuilds are super fast in Dev mode (`aot: true`), the Angular CLI often doesn’t pick up changes to SCSS and HTML. I need to constantly re-run `ng serve` over and over again to see my changes.

this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 7.2.15\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Tests fail to complete when assigning properties to `this`.\r\nThe Jasmine documentation under https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite explains the usage of `this` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe this keyword\r\nAnother way to share variables between a beforeEach, it, and afterEach is through the this keyword. Each spec's beforeEach/it/afterEach has the this as the same empty object that is set back to empty for the next spec's beforeEach/it/afterEach.\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\ndescribe(\"A spec\", function() {\r\n  beforeEach(function() {\r\n    this.foo = 0;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it(\"can use the `this` to share state\", function() {\r\n    expect(this.foo).toEqual(0);\r\n    this.bar = \"test pollution?\";\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it(\"prevents test pollution by having an empty `this` created for the next spec\", function() {\r\n    expect(this.foo).toEqual(0);\r\n    expect(this.bar).toBe(undefined);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I include `this` references in my test suite the tests fail with\r\n```\r\nFailed: Cannot set property 'foo' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Assign something to `this` in any test\r\n- Run `ng test`\r\n\r\nShould be fairly simple to reproduce, but in case example is necessary a reproduction of the issue is hosted at https://github.com/jakkn/angular8-cli-ng-test-this-bug-repro\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!--

The concept of `allowNull` also doesn't really apply when getting a list of elements\r\n- The `find` method is confusing as it doesn't actually find anything, it returns a function to find things\r\n- The user is required to specify the host selector for the harness they want to load, even though the harness should always know what selector its looking for\r\n\r\n## New API\r\nThe new API combines the variaous `load` methods as well as the `Locator` class from the old API into a single class called `HarnessEnvironment`. The `HarnessEnvironment` implements two separate interfaces, one for test authors: `HarnessLoader`, and one for component harness authors: `LocatorFactory`. Both protractor and testbed have their own concrete implementations of `HarnessEnvironment`, but they cannot be constructed directly. Users are required to construct them via a `create` method which returns a `HarnessLoader` interface. This way only the methods that make sense for the test author are exposed to the test author.\r\n\r\nThe `HarnessLoader` provides methods to find new `HarnessLoader`s for sub-portions of the DOM and methods to create `ComponentHarness`es by searching for the corresponding host selector under its root element. Each `ComponentHarness` class is required to specify its host selector, so the user doesn't have to.\r\n\r\nThe `LocatorFactory` is the interface to the `HarnessEnvironent` available when extending `ComponentHarness`. It gives harness authors methods to create locator functions for finding `TestElement`s and `ComponentHarness`es under its root element. It also provides a method to get a `LocatorFactory` rooted at the document root, this can be used instead of the `global` option from the old API.\r\n\r\nThe methods described above for finding `HarnessLoader`s `ComponentHarnesses` and locator functions come in 3 different flavors (required, optional, and all). These different variants should be used instead of the old `allowNull` syntax. There is currently no replacement for `{allowNull: undefined}` but if we feel its important we can add a default variant of the method as well.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Component harness author code\r\n```ts\r\n// Old\r\nclass MyHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  readonly header = this.find(MyHeaderHarness, 'my-header', {allowNull: false});\r\n  readonly overlay = this.find('.my-overlay', {allowNull: false, global: true});\r\n}\r\n\r\n// New\r\nclass MyHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  readonly header = this.requiredLocator(MyHeaderHarness);\r\n  readonly overlay = this.documentRootLocatorFactory().optionalLocator('.my-overlay');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test author code\r\n```ts\r\n// Old\r\nit('does stuff', async () => {\r\n  const harness = load(MyHarness, fixture);\r\n  // Not possible to load harness for specific subsection\r\n});\r\n\r\n// New\r\nit('does stuff', async () => {\r\n  const harness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixtureRoot(MyHarness, fixture);\r\n  const subsectionLoader = await TestvedHarnessEnvironment.create(fixture).findRequired('.sub-section');\r\n  const subsectionHarness = await subsectionLoader.requiredHarness(MyHarness);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- Should we add a plain `locator` method that behaves the same as `requiredLocator` for unit tests but doesn't check `element.isPresent` in e2e tests?\r\n- Its slightly more verbose, but should we call the methods `locatorForRequired`?

Tree nodes in the bottom sheet **are not** expanded, despite a call to `treeControl.expandAll()` inside a `setTimeout` callback \r\n \r\nProof that the `setTimeout` is somehow causing this, is that if you comment out the call to `window.setTimeout(() => this.treeControl.expandAll(), 3000)` (line 54) and uncomment the simpler `this.treeControl.expandAll();` call (line 57) it does work.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBottom sheet should open with all tree nodes expanded, due to the call to `treeControl.expandAll()` call.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTree nodes are all collapsed, **despite** a the call to `treeControl.expandAll()` call.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):  MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16212","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tree expand/collapse API does not work from setTimeout callback\" (#16212)"},{"Id":"452413184","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-05T09:55:19","Actor":"alexanderPastornicky","Number":"16211","RawContent":null,"Title":"style(progress-spinner): move private var to beginning of class","State":"open","Body":"for consistency : private vars should come at beginning of the class, not after setter declaration","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16211","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"style(progress-spinner): move private var to beginning of class\" (#16211)"},{"Id":"452400279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-05T09:53:10","Actor":"alexanderPastornicky","Number":"16210","RawContent":null,"Title":"style(progress-spinner): move private var to beginning of class","State":"closed","Body":"for consistency - private vars should come at the beginning of the class, not after setter declaration","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16210","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"style(progress-spinner): move private var to beginning of class\" (#16210)"},{"Id":"452342958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-05T09:35:53","Actor":"jspieker","Number":"16209","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat-hint causing an ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError if respective input has a *ngIf directive","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[Minimal repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-x3assq?file=app%2Fform-field-overview-example.html\r\n) on StackBlitz.

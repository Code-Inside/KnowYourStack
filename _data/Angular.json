Indeed, the spec file contains these three tests:\n\n```ts\n  it('should create the app', () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    const app = fixture.componentInstance;\n    expect(app).toBeTruthy();\n  });\n\n  it(`should have the 'foov20' title`, () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    const app = fixture.componentInstance;\n    expect(app.title).toEqual('foov20');\n  });\n\n  it('should render title', () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    fixture.detectChanges();\n    const compiled = fixture.nativeElement as HTMLElement;\n    expect(compiled.querySelector('h1')?.textContent).toContain('Hello, foov20');\n  });\n```\n\nbut I would argue that \n\n - the first one isn't really useful (if it fails, the other two tests also fail)\n - the second one (which is the one that does not compile anymore) isn't really useful either: it tests the internal implementation of the component rather than testing its behavior, and the third one is sufficient.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`npx @angular/cli@next new foov20`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0-rc.2\nNode: 20.12.2\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0-rc.1\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular/build               20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.0-rc.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0-rc.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30335","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generated app component does not respect style guide\" (#30335)"},{"Id":"3074349888","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T17:15:56","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"30344","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): use protected for class member","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example:\n\nCode\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant copilot      # Generates .github/COPILOT_GUIDE.md\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant cursor       # Generates .cursor/rules.md\nng generate prompt-guide --assistant generic      # Generates PROMPT_GUIDE.md in project root\n\nThis would:\nHelp teams adopt AI assistant best practices quickly.\nEnsure prompt guides are in the correct and expected locations.\nAllow easy expansion as new assistants and conventions emerge.\nKeep Angular projects clean by not including these files by default.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30341","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CLI command to create AI prompt guide markdown for Copilot, Cursor, and others\" (#30341)"},{"Id":"3067944666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T08:47:23","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30324","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@eslint/js](https://eslint.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/js)) | devDependencies | minor | [`9.26.0` -> `9.27.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@eslint%2fjs/9.26.0/9.27.0) |\n| [baseline-browser-mapping](https://redirect.github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping) | devDependencies | patch | [`2.4.1` -> `2.4.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/baseline-browser-mapping/2.4.1/2.4.2) |\n| [eslint](https://eslint.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint)) | devDependencies | minor | [`9.26.0` -> `9.27.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint/9.26.0/9.27.0) |\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.28.17` -> `v3.28.18` |\n| [quicktype-core](https://redirect.github.com/quicktype/quicktype) | devDependencies | minor | [`23.1.4` -> `23.2.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/quicktype-core/23.1.4/23.2.5) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | minor | [`4.40.2` -> `4.41.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.40.2/4.41.0) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup)) | devDependencies | minor | [`4.40.2` -> `4.41.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/4.40.2/4.41.0) |\n| [sass](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass) | dependencies | minor | [`1.88.0` -> `1.89.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/sass/1.88.0/1.89.0) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.39.1` -> `5.39.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.39.1/5.39.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (@&#8203;eslint/js)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.27.0`](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v9.27.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v9.26.0...v9.27.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   [`d71e37f`](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/d71e37f450f4ae115ec394615e21523685f0d370) feat: Allow flags to be set in ESLINT_FLAGS env variable ([#&#8203;19717](https://redirect.github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19717)) (Nicholas C.

They all live together in an Nx monorepository. It is the responsibility of one of these applications to handle user login. For ease of development, we have long configured each app and their proxies to handle forwarding to every other app, so that developers can start whichever apps are relevant to the work they are doing, log in using that app on its own port, and then navigate to other apps without needing to manually type a different port.\n\nI hope this makes sense, I can try to explain more clearly if it doesn't. The important part is that we nearly always have more than one app running, and no matter which app's dev-server port you are on, they will always be able to forward requests intended for apps other than themselves. To achieve this each app has a unique base path which the proxy configuration uses to determine where to send requests.\n\nWe recently switched from the `browser` builder to the new `application` builder, and as a consequence the `dev-server` now uses Vite rather than Webpack. On the whole this has all been a great, apart from one thing: hot module reloading is broken cross-app.\n\nI've created and linked a (somewhat minimal) reproduction repository below.\n\nWhile investigating this myself, I noticed that when an app tries to hot update while on the \"wrong\" port, the part that seems to fail is fetching the new JavaScript file. The WebSocket connects just fine, receives the `angular:component-update` event just fine, and makes the request for the updated file just fine. The request even succeeds, actually, but the response is empty. Some screenshots for explanation:\n\n<img width=\"1282\" alt=\"WebSocket connects\" title=\"WebSocket connects\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74259f69-c61a-4bb8-b462-3a8a6dbcd4c0\" />\n\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"WebSocket receives update event\" title=\"WebSocket receives update event\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/622cb771-fbac-4595-94e8-f742a4b6d267\" />\n\n<img alt=\"JavaScript response is empty\" title=\"JavaScript response is empty\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a86b6e36-fa04-48a4-ba12-3185d429d2fa\" />\n\nIt's worth noting that `full-reload` events work just fine, which is probably expected given the nature of what's failing about the hot reload.\n\nThat's as far as I've gotten. I'm not sure if there is some proxy configuration that I could do to fix this (I've tried some basic tweaks with no luck), or if this is a bug somewhere that needs to be fixed. But in the meantime, turning HMR off \"fixes\" things for us, though it isn't ideal of course.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you!\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/tmercswims/ng-vite-mono-hmr\n\nIncludes reproduction steps in README.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.12\nNode: 22.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.11\n... common, core, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.12\n@angular/cli                    19.2.12\n@angular/compiler               19.2.11\n@angular/compiler-cli           19.2.11\n@schematics/angular             19.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.2\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30321","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running multiple applications which proxy to each other breaks HMR\" (#30321)"},{"Id":"3066733172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T15:59:33","Actor":"LakshminadhSDx","Number":"30317","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.11 not published, causing install errors with @angular/cli@19.2.11","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I run ng new my-app, the process fails with the error:\nNo matching version found for @angular-devkit/build-angular@^19.2.11.\nI expected the Angular CLI to create a new project successfully.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOpen terminal\nRun ng new my-app\nWait for dependencies to install\nSee the error\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nnpm ERR!

[#&#8203;433](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/433), [#&#8203;452](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/452), [#&#8203;460](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/460)\n    Before v9.0.0, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> when `--max-processes` is set meant that only those commands would receive it. Once these stopped, the pending commands would start, which in turn meant that another <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> press would be necessary to stop them, and so on.\n    Similar situation applied to combining `--max-processes` with `--kill-others`/`--kill-others-on-fail`.\n\n    Starting with v9.0.0, this no longer happens, as these flags and/or key presses send a signal to stop the running commands in addition to preventing new commands from running.\n-   **The `concurrently` and default exports are now the same** - [#&#8203;399](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/399)\n    It's reasonable to expect that `import { concurrently } from 'concurrently'` would work the same as `import concurrently from 'concurrently'`, however this has not been the case.\n    The former used to be an unconfigured version of concurrently, lacking all features that you'd get from the CLI, which was seen as a \"footgun\". Both are now the same function.\n\n    If you'd like to access the unconfigured function, use `import { createConcurrently } from 'concurrently'` instead.\n\n### ✨ New Features\n\n-   Exponential back-off support for process restarting - [#&#8203;265](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/265), [#&#8203;462](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/462)\n    Use `--restart-after exponential`. Restarts happen at `2^N` seconds.\n-   Add prefix padding via new `--pad-prefix` flag - [#&#8203;166](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/166), [#&#8203;417](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/417), [#&#8203;495](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/495)\n-   Specify teardown commands via

`node:<script>` commands to `node --run <script>` - [#&#8203;475](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/475)\n-   *\\[API only]* Inter-Process Communication (ipc) - [#&#8203;498](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/498)\n-   *\\[API only]* Make it possible to use no colors at all - [#&#8203;466](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/466)\n-   *\\[API only]* Add a `state` field to `Command` - [#&#8203;455](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/455)\n\n### 🐛 Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fix importing concurrently in ESM package - [#&#8203;454](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/454), [#&#8203;456](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/456), [#&#8203;494](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/494)\n-   Make sure concurrently doesn't resolve when manually restarting commands through API - [#&#8203;463](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/463), [#&#8203;464](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/464)\n-   Fix warning coming from `spawn-command` when running in Node 22 - [#&#8203;407](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/407), [#&#8203;477](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/477), [#&#8203;479](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/479), [#&#8203;492](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/492)\n-   Make `--raw` and `--hide` compatible - [#&#8203;394](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/394), [#&#8203;486](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/486)\n-   Ensure prefix is written when logging without a trailing LF - [#&#8203;276](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/276), [#&#8203;467](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/467)\n\n### Other Changes\n\n-   `--help` no longer shows examples due to there being too many.\n    Refer to https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/tree/v9.0.0/docs instead, or to  the `node_modules/concurrently/docs` directory in your project.\n-   Improve examples of `--passthrough-arguments` - [#&#8203;490](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/490)\n-   Replace `date-fns` with hand-rolled date formatting - [#&#8203;436](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/436), [#&#8203;443](https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/443)\n    This should make installing concurrently faster.\n\n### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;odeadglaz](https://redirect.github.com/odeadglaz) made their first contribution in

I implemented a simple dialog feature using MatDialog. Everything works just fine but when I try to write unit tests, I get this terminal error : \n\n```bash\nApplication bundle generation failed. [0.132 seconds]\n\nX [ERROR] Could not resolve \"@angular/animations/browser\"\n\n    node_modules/@angular/platform-browser/fesm2022/animations.mjs:10:20:\n      10 │ import * as i1 from '@angular/animations/browser';\n         ╵                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  You can mark the path \"@angular/animations/browser\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n```\n\nAfter some debug, I found the cause : `MatDialogHarness`. But still I cannot figure why and what can I do to solve this problem without adding `@angular/animations`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Generate a new project using @angular/cli@next\n2. Verify in `package.json` that `@angular/animations` is not there\n3. replace `app.spec.ts` with the following code and run tests :\n\n```ts\nimport { TestbedHarnessEnvironment } from '@angular/cdk/testing/testbed';\nimport { provideZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';\nimport { MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS } from '@angular/material/core';\nimport { MatDialogHarness } from '@angular/material/dialog/testing';\nimport { App } from './app';\n\ndescribe('App', () => {\n  beforeEach(async () => {\n    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      imports: [App],\n      providers: [\n        provideZonelessChangeDetection(),\n        {\n          provide: MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS,\n          useValue: { animationsDisabled: true },\n        },\n      ],\n    }).compileComponents();\n  });\n\n  it('should not open dialog', async () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    const loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);\n    const dialog = await loader.getHarnessOrNull(MatDialogHarness);\n    expect(dialog).toBeNull();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMatDialogHarness shouldn't cause crash when running tests while not having `@angular/animations` installed\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCrash\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.0.0-rc.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.0.0-rc.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome (latest)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31145","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): @angular/animations package still required to use MatDialogHarness\" (#31145)"},{"Id":"3073083292","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T08:59:52","Actor":"lopatnov","Number":"31143","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-autocomplete): missing multiple option in mat-autocomplete, but in mat-select this feature present","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nComponents are not consistent.

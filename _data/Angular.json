So when we create the form we have empy `FromArray`s at top level so we can't just use `setValue`/`patchValue` and that's where it becomes a real hell to update such \"empty\" form with real data.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nCan we have a possibility to somehow supply a form with it's future structure despite that fact the form itself is empty from the beginning? This way we have an ability to simply use `setValue`/`patchValue` on the \"root\" form of any complexity and nesting level.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI don't really see any alternatives to simply use `setValue`/`patchValue` on complex nested forms with multilevel `FormArray`s","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44894","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typed forms\" (#44894)"},{"Id":"1118307223","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-29T19:31:10","Actor":"devversion","Number":"44893","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch benchpress NPM output to APF with ESM ","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44893","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: switch benchpress NPM output to APF with ESM \" (#44893)"},{"Id":"1118197977","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-29T12:02:03","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"44892","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency d3 to v7","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [d3](https://d3js.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/d3/d3)) | [`^5.7.0` -> `^7.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/d3/5.16.0/7.3.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/d3/7.3.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/d3/7.3.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/d3/7.3.0/compatibility-slim/5.16.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/d3/7.3.0/confidence-slim/5.16.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>d3/d3</summary>\n\n### [`v7.3.0`](https://togithub.com/d3/d3/releases/v7.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/d3/d3/compare/v7.2.1...v7.3.0)\n\n-   Add [d3.symbolsStroke](https://togithub.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/main/README.md#symbolsStroke).

However the JS community has generally standardized on `===` and `!==` as the go to comparison operators, with many tools banning `==` and `!=` outright from codebases. This is because `==` and `!=` have unintuitive type conversion semantics which can be hard to reason about and lead to bugs. We should consider emitting a warning/error for these operators in Angular templates to catch these mistakes immediately and save the developer an hour of debugging.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAn extended diagnostic could easily identify this case and emit a warning. Users would also be free to configure the diagnostic as a hard error if they desired and truly purge `==` and `!=` from their codebase.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nYou could expect me to remember not to do this, but that ain't happenin'.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44872","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Warn on `==` / `!=` in templates\" (#44872)"},{"Id":"1116939465","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T02:37:18","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"44871","RawContent":null,"Title":"Better error message for nullish coalescing a pipe argument","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncompiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOperator precedence between nullish coalescing an a pipe argument can be confusing. Often they are used together in this way:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<span>{{ birthday | date: 'YYYY-MM-dd' ?? 'Unknown' }}</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the developer probably intended for the birthday to be formatted like \"YYYY-MM-dd\", and if that format returned `null` or `undefined` for some reason (such as `birthday` being `null` or `undefined`), then it should fall back to \"Unknown\". However in practice, the `??` has higher precedence than the `|`, so it actually does `'YYYY-MM-dd' ?? 'Unknown'`, which is useless.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- How the developer wanted it to work. -->\r\n<span>{{ (birthday | date: 'YYYY-MM-dd') ?? 'Unknown' }}</span>\r\n\r\n<!-- How it actually works. -->\r\n<span>{{ birthday | date: ('YYYY-MM-dd' ?? 'Unknown') }}</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis mistake should be highlighted to users to bring awareness about the issue and how to properly parenthesize the expression to do what they want.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe already have [an extended diagnostic for a useless nullish coalescing operator](https://angular.io/extended-diagnostics/NG8102), which is triggered by `'YYYY-MM-dd' ?? 'Unknown'` and [correctly identifies this mistake](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/43419). Unfortunately the error message is a bit unclear. We should either adjust the diagnostic or add a new one to specifically call out this pipe use case and suggest adding parentheses in the right manner.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could just leave the existing diagnostic as is and accept a less-accurate error message. It does correctly identify the mistake, just with a less-than-ideal error message.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better error message for nullish coalescing a pipe argument\" (#44871)"},{"Id":"1116935779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T02:29:53","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"44870","RawContent":null,"Title":"Warn on non-nullable optional chain","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nOptional chaining is a great way to safely access properties that might be `null` or `undefined`, for example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {Component, Input} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n    <span>Hello, {{ user?.name ?? 'guest' }}!</span>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class Greeter {\r\n  @Input() user?: User;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface User {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut things can easily change and make the optional chain useless, such as:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  export class Greeter {\r\n-   @Input() user?: User;\r\n+   @Input() user: User;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change means that the optional chain `user?.name` is no longer useful because `user` will never be `null` or `undefined`. This leads to confusion and tricks readers of the code into thinking that there is a case where \"Hello, guest!\" is displayed, when that actually isn't the case. If the default \"guest\" string comes from somewhere else, it could lead to dead code and possibly result in excess bundle size.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should consider an extended diagnostic to identify and warn developers in this situation. We already have [a diagnostic to warn about useless nullish coalescing operators `??`](https://angular.io/extended-diagnostics/NG8102), so it makes sense to have a similar check for optional chaining.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44870","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Warn on non-nullable optional chain\" (#44870)"},{"Id":"1116930633","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T02:19:40","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"44869","RawContent":null,"Title":"Validate a11y attributes","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nWe should have the Angular compiler validate the types for a11y features of the DOM, such as `role` or `aria-*` attributes to make sure they are always set to valid values.

This can contain a description, and there are other `i18n-` attributes which provide localized versions of user-visible text (such as `i18n-title`). The attributes are easy to forget, especially edge cases like `i18n-title`. There should be some kind of conformance check which verifies that all text in an application is marked for internationalization.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe could have an extended diagnostic which requires that every message in the compilation is marked for `i18n` and warns / errors for messages missing the relevant attribute. It could also warn on attributes like `title` and suggest `i18n-title` as an alternative.\r\n\r\nSince not every app is internationalized, this check probably needs to be off by default, but having a one line config change like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  {\r\n    \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n      \"extendedDiagnostics\": {\r\n        \"checks\": {\r\n+         \"i18nMessages\": \"error\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be a really easy way to make sure no messages fall through the cracks.\r\n\r\nWe may want some kind of `i18n-ignore` attribute to allow some messages to be skipped.

IE11 Support.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nDon't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n# tldr:\r\n- im need to support IE11 (so still on v12)\r\n- the web-worker file generated via cli is still a `.ts` file inside my dist folder (IE no likey)\r\n- the docs that that show you how to get your web-worker url using `include.meta` did not return the correct path in IE11.\r\n\r\n# What happened\r\n1. Using https://v12.angular.io/guide/web-worker\r\n2. I added web-worker via cli to my poject.. it added a tsconfig file.. updated my angular.json etc.\r\n3. I moved my webworker code into a service and updated paths..\r\n    ` Worker = new Worker(new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url));`\r\n4. Everything ran fine in chrome.. but now IE11 was throwing `Object doesn't not support this action`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What  was wrong\r\n\r\n### First Issue\r\nAfter farting around for a few hours (adding shims.. looking at compiled code etc etc).. i realized the actual file in the dist folder was not `.js` but still a `.ts` file!  The url being provided to the Worker via (`new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url)`) was `...../survey/super-logic.ts`.. and obviously IE11 didnt like that. (`/survey` is my dist/route)\r\n\r\n**My Fix**: Changed the worker to a `js` file and edited the `tsconfig.webworker.ts` to only include `.js` files:\r\n```\r\n  \"include\": [\r\n    \"src/**/*.worker.js\"\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Second Issue\r\nDuring my debugging... I added console logs to my service to print out the url to the service worker.  For some reason, IE11 was producing a different URL than what Chrome was.\r\n- Chrome: `...mydomain.local/survey/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\n- IE11: `...mydomain.local/survey/take/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\nSo again.. obviously IE could not find the file...   The service was provided in root.. but it might be important to note that this service was being injected from a module which was being lazy-loaded.\r\n\r\n**My Fix**:  Since all the files are dumped in root of the dist folder... I just hard-coded the path to the dist folder into service and used the generated filename provided by the new URL:\r\n```javascript\r\n      const url = new URL('./../../shared/workers/logic-worker.worker', import.meta.url);\r\n      // IE11 hack.. for some reason this is wrong.. just force to dist folder root\r\n      const finalUrl = `/survey/${url.toString().split('/').pop()}`;\r\n      this.worker = new Worker(finalUrl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps others with this issue if nothing else.

Based on our initial testing, in Angular 13 the issue only affects the `scripts.js` file in the distribution build.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt seems that some output files' file name hashes are generated incorrectly, when building with output hashing (e.g. `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`). This can cause issues e.g. for Angular applications served from CDNs, where only changed files are uploaded, and the files are diff’d based on their revhash in the filename.\r\n\r\nIn our concrete case (Angular 13, having `outputHashing` = `all` in `angular.json`), when changing the TypeScript target version from `es2017` to any of `es2019`, `es2020`, or `es2021` in the project’s `tsconfig.json`, then rebuilding the project, the file name hash of the generated output file containing global scripts (in our case, the file is named per the default configuration `scripts.js`) does not change, **even though the contents of the `scripts.js` generated output file itself changes.**\r\n\r\n**The expected behaviour is that the revhash generated into any output file’s filename should change if (and only if) the final contents of the output file changes.**\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Clone [https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction](https://github.com/tresorit/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction).\r\n2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.\r\n3. Run `ng build --configuration=production` (with the default `es2017` target in `tsconfig.json`).\r\n4. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_1}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch(c){}`.\r\n5. Change the `compilerOptions.target` to `es2019` (or `es2020` or `es2021`) from `es2017` in `tsconfig.json`.\r\n6. Run `ng build --configuration=production`.\r\n7. Observe the contents of the output `dist/angular-filename-hashing-bug-reproduction/scripts.{revhash_2}.js` file to be `try{console.log()}catch{}` (different from the output from step 4).\r\n8. Observe that `revhash_1` equals `revhash_2`.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.4\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nIt’s a long shot and we’re not sure whether it’s even connected, but we’ve found that hashing for the scripts doesn’t use `contenthash`, which might be relevant: \r\n\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d18469eb3f09f9d38c6c2c52027eb2f6a5c50c9b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/utils/helpers.ts#L41-L46)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Output files' filename hashes are incorrect\" (#22602)"},{"Id":"1117538554","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-28T15:34:18","Actor":"fischeversenker","Number":"22600","RawContent":null,"Title":"Defaults are not applied when using $refs in json schema","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] `ng generate` / `schematics`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI don't know, sorry.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI noticed that the `schematics` CLI is applying defaults in a schema differently, depending on whether a property is defined \"inline\" or defined in a reference using `$ref`. This applies to both `ng generate` and `schematics`.\r\n\r\nAssume this schema for a schematic:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\r\n  \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n    \"Reference\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"inlineProperty\": {\r\n      \"default\": false,\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"referencedProperty\": {\r\n      \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Reference\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"type\": \"object\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a schematic that uses this schema is called without any arguments, the `options` object that it receives looks like this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, that it does not contain the `referencedProperty`, even though it uses the same exact schema - only it's referencing it. If the contents of the reference are copied into the `referencedProperty`, then the same default-logic is applied to it and the `options` object turns into this:\r\n```ts\r\n{ inlineProperty: false, referencedProperty: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the `schematics` schema validation to apply the same logic for defaults, regardless of whether properties are defined \"inline\" or as a reference.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI provided a minimal setup in [this repository](https://github.com/fischeversenker/angular-schematics-defaults-bug).

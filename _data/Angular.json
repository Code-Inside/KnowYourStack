This approach of stubbing the `ActivatedRoute` creates a situation that can easily cause the test to break. The stub often only mocks out the dependencies that the component/service _currently_ needs. This dependencies might change over time and break the test in an unexpected way. In addition, it is difficult to get the structure of `ActivatedRoute` exactly correct.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow unit tests to quickly set up routes, trigger real navigations in the Router, and get instances of component's to test along with real instances of `ActivatedRoute`. This all comes without needing to know that the component depends on `ActivatedRoute` at all. This becomes more important when considering that a component may be refactored in the future to use `@Input` rather than access data on the `ActivatedRoute` instance (see #18967).

However I think this is indicative of a bigger problem in the compiler that it allows you to shadow built-in symbols. `$localize` is the most obvious one, but I think the same thing can happen to `i0`? The following snippet compiles without error:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { $localize } from '@angular/localize/init';\r\n\r\n(() => {\r\n  const i0 = null;\r\n\r\n  @Component({\r\n    selector: 'lib-library-with-localize',\r\n    template: `<div i18n>unused library template with localize</div>`,\r\n    standalone: true,\r\n  })\r\n  class LibraryWithLocalizeComponent {\r\n    name = $localize`my name`;\r\n  }\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that will fail at runtime given that the generated `i0.*` instructions will resolve to the `null` constant. `i0` is harder to misuse given that the compiler actually generates `import * as i0 from '...';`, so you get a name conflict if you define a top-level constant for it (which is also unintuitive, but better than compiling successfully and failing later). Also given that the symbol is only ever used in the code generated by `@Component()` (I think?) there aren't many situations outside of my contrived example where someone could reasonably shadow `i0` in a breaking manner.\r\n\r\nWe should consider banning any compiler built-in from being shadowed in user-code. Users just shouldn't be able to declare variables named `$localize` because they will have different semantics from the built-in symbol. For `i0`, I think the ideal fix would just be for the compiler to pick a different name (`i1`) if `i0` is already taken. Not sure how hard that is given that we'd probably want to verify _all_ symbols in the file, not just top-level declarations. Are there other \"built-in symbols\" we'd want to ban from user code?\r\n\r\nJust to be a pedant, I'll point that out that _technically_ `with` becomes a problem here, since users could write something like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport '@angular/localize';\r\n\r\nconst imARealJerk = {\r\n  $localize: () => { /* ... */ },\r\n};\r\n\r\nwith (imARealJerk) {\r\n  console.log($localize`Oh so you think you're such a wiz at CS205-Compilers?`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically we could inspect the type of the object to look for `$localize` key, but that's probably not worth the effort and we could just ignore `with` cases.

\"legal comment\" behavior again ([#&#8203;2745](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2745))\n\n    The legal comments feature automatically gathers comments containing `@license` or `@preserve` and puts the comments somewhere (either in the generated code or in a separate file). This behavior used to be on by default but was disabled by default in version 0.16.0 because automatically inserting comments is potentially confusing and misleading. These comments can appear to be assigning the copyright of your code to another entity. And this behavior can be especially problematic if it happens automatically by default since you may not even be aware of it happening. For example, if you bundle the TypeScript compiler the preserving legal comments means your source code would contain this comment, which appears to be assigning the copyright of all of your code to Microsoft:\n\n    ```js\n    /*! *****************************************************************************\n    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\n    this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the\n    License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    THIS CODE IS PROVIDED ON AN *AS IS* BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED\n    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n    MERCHANTABLITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n    See the Apache Version 2.0 License for specific language governing permissions\n    and limitations under the License.\n    ***************************************************************************** */\n    ```\n\n    However, people have asked for this feature to be re-enabled by default. To resolve the confusion about what these comments are applying to, esbuild's default behavior will now be to attempt to describe which package the comments are coming from. So while this feature has been re-enabled by default, the output will now look something like this instead:\n\n    ```js\n    /*! Bundled license information:\n\n    typescript/lib/typescript.js:\n      (*! *****************************************************************************\n      Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n      Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\n      this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the\n      License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n      THIS CODE IS PROVIDED ON AN *AS IS* BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n      KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED\n      WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n      MERCHANTABLITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n      See the Apache Version 2.0 License for specific language governing permissions\n      and limitations under the License.\n      ***************************************************************************** *)\n    */\n    ```\n\n    Note that you can still customize this behavior with the `--legal-comments=` flag. For example, you can use `--legal-comments=none` to turn this off, or you can use `--legal-comments=linked` to put these comments in a separate `.LEGAL.txt` file instead.\n\n-   Enable `external` legal comments with the transform API ([#&#8203;2390](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2390))\n\n    Previously esbuild's transform API only supported `none`, `inline`, or `eof` legal comments. With this release, `external` legal comments are now also supported with the transform API. This only applies to the JS and Go APIs, not to the CLI, and looks like this:\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        const { code, legalComments } = await esbuild.transform(input, {\n          legalComments: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Transform(input, api.TransformOptions{\n          LegalComments: api.LegalCommentsEndOfFile,\n        })\n        code := result.Code\n        legalComments := result.LegalComments\n        ```\n\n-   Fix duplicate function declaration edge cases ([#&#8203;2757](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2757))\n\n    The change in the previous release to forbid duplicate function declarations in certain cases accidentally forbid some edge cases that should have been allowed. Specifically duplicate function declarations are forbidden in nested blocks in strict mode and at the top level of modules, but are allowed when they are declared at the top level of function bodies. This release fixes the regression by re-allowing the last case.\n\n-   Allow package subpaths with `alias` ([#&#8203;2715](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2715))\n\n    Previously the names passed to the `alias` feature had to be the name of a package (with or without a package scope). With this release, you can now also use the `alias` feature with package subpaths. So for example you can now create an alias that substitutes `@org/pkg/lib` with something else.\n\n### [`v0.16.9`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0169)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.8...v0.16.9)\n\n-   Update to Unicode 15.0.0\n\n    The character tables that determine which characters form valid JavaScript identifiers have been updated from Unicode version 14.0.0 to the newly-released Unicode version 15.0.0. I'm not putting an example in the release notes because all of the new characters will likely just show up as little squares since fonts haven't been updated yet. But you can read https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/#Summary for more information about the changes.\n\n-   Disallow duplicate lexically-declared names in nested blocks and in strict mode\n\n    In strict mode or in a nested block, it's supposed to be a syntax error to declare two symbols with the same name unless all duplicate entries are either `function` declarations or all `var` declarations. However, esbuild was overly permissive and allowed this when duplicate entries were either `function` declarations or `var` declarations (even if they were mixed). This check has now been made more restrictive to match the JavaScript specification:\n\n    ```js\n    // JavaScript allows this\n    var a\n    function a() {}\n    {\n      var b\n      var b\n      function c() {}\n      function c() {}\n    }\n\n    // JavaScript doesn't allow this\n    {\n      var d\n      function d() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add a type declaration for the new `empty` loader ([#&#8203;2755](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2755))\n\n    I forgot to add this in the previous release. It has now been added.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;fz6m](https://togithub.com/fz6m).\n\n-   Add support for the `v` flag in regular expression literals\n\n    People are currently working on adding a `v` flag to JavaScript regular expresions. You can read more about this flag here: https://v8.dev/features/regexp-v-flag. This release adds support for parsing this flag, so esbuild will now no longer consider regular expression literals with this flag to be a syntax error. If the target is set to something other than `esnext`, esbuild will transform regular expression literals containing this flag into a `new RegExp()` constructor call so the resulting code doesn't have a syntax error. This enables you to provide a polyfill for `RegExp` that implements the `v` flag to get your code to work at run-time. While esbuild doesn't typically adopt proposals until they're already shipping in a real JavaScript run-time, I'm adding it now because a) esbuild's implementation doesn't need to change as the proposal evolves, b) this isn't really new syntax since regular expression literals already have flags, and c) esbuild's implementation is a trivial pass-through anyway.\n\n-   Avoid keeping the name of classes with static `name` properties\n\n    The `--keep-names` property attempts to preserve the original value of the `name` property for functions and classes even when identifiers are renamed by the minifier or to avoid a name collision. This is currently done by generating code to assign a string to the `name` property on the function or class object. However, this should not be done for classes with a static `name` property since in that case the explicitly-defined `name` property overwrites the automatically-generated class name. With this release, esbuild will now no longer attempt to preserve the `name` property for classes with a static `name` property.\n\n### [`v0.16.8`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0168)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.7...v0.16.8)\n\n-   Allow plugins to resolve injected files ([#&#8203;2754](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2754))\n\n    Previously paths passed to the `inject` feature were always interpreted as file system paths. This meant that `onResolve` plugins would not be run for them and esbuild's default path resolver would always be used. This meant that the `inject` feature couldn't be used in the browser since the browser doesn't have access to a file system. This release runs paths passed to `inject` through esbuild's full path resolution pipeline so plugins now have a chance to handle them using `onResolve` callbacks. This makes it possible to write a plugin that makes esbuild's `inject` work in the browser.\n\n-   Add the `empty` loader ([#&#8203;1541](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1541), [#&#8203;2753](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2753))\n\n    The new `empty` loader tells esbuild to pretend that a file is empty. So for example `--loader:.css=empty` effectively skips all imports of `.css` files in JavaScript so that they aren't included in the bundle, since `import \"./some-empty-file\"` in JavaScript doesn't bundle anything. You can also use the `empty` loader to remove asset references in CSS files. For example `--loader:.png=empty` causes esbuild to replace asset references such as `url(image.png)` with `url()` so that they are no longer included in the resulting style sheet.\n\n-   Fix `</script>` and `</style>` escaping for non-default targets ([#&#8203;2748](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2748))\n\n    The change in version 0.16.0 to give control over `</script>` escaping via `--supported:inline-script=false` or `--supported:inline-script=true` accidentally broke automatic escaping of `</script>` when an explicit `target` setting is specified. This release restores the correct automatic escaping of `</script>` (which should not depend on what `target` is set to).\n\n-   Enable the `exports` field with `NODE_PATHS` ([#&#8203;2752](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2752))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATHS` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously it only supported the old `main` field path resolution but did not support the new `exports` field package resolution. This release makes the path resolution rules the same again for both `node_modules` directories and `NODE_PATHS` directories.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.30.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.30.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.29.0...v8.30.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`075ef2c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/075ef2cf315e75b51b671c40ce9a97c66b2e4b50) feat: add suggestion for no-return-await ([#&#8203;16637](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16637)) (Daniel Bartholomae)\n-   [`7190d98`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/7190d98ff40023f24b0c6a98319ae8a82c99ff5b) feat: update globals ([#&#8203;16654](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16654)) (Sébastien Règne)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`1a327aa`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1a327aae57f1b68c96b27cc1bd57f8198d5a3a7c) fix: Ensure flat config unignores work consistently like eslintrc ([#&#8203;16579](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16579)) (Nicholas C.

Previously when bundling with the `file` loader, there was no reference in the metafile from the JavaScript file containing the path string to the copied file. With this release, there will now be a reference in the metafile in the `imports` array with the kind `file-loader`:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       ...\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\": {\n           ...\n         },\n         \"out/entry.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"file-loader\"\n    +        }\n           ],\n           ...\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix byte counts in metafile regarding references to other output files ([#&#8203;2071](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2071))\n\n    Previously files that contained references to other output files had slightly incorrect metadata for the byte counts of input files which contributed to that output file. So for example if `app.js` imports `image.png` using the file loader and esbuild generates `out.js` and `image-LSAMBFUD.png`, the metadata for how many bytes of `out.js` are from `app.js` was slightly off (the metadata for the byte count of `out.js` was still correct). The reason is because esbuild substitutes the final paths for references between output files toward the end of the build to handle cyclic references, and the byte counts needed to be adjusted as well during the path substitution. This release fixes these byte counts (specifically the `bytesInOutput` values).\n\n-   The alias feature now strips a trailing slash ([#&#8203;2730](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2730))\n\n    People sometimes add a trailing slash to the name of one of node's built-in modules to force node to import from the file system instead of importing the built-in module. For example, importing `util` imports node's built-in module called `util` but importing `util/` tries to find a package called `util` on the file system. Previously attempting to use esbuild's package alias feature to replace imports to `util` with a specific file would fail because the file path would also gain a trailing slash (e.g. mapping `util` to `./file.js` turned `util/` into `./file.js/`). With this release, esbuild will now omit the path suffix if it's a single trailing slash, which should now allow you to successfully apply aliases to these import paths.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.8`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1508-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1507v1508-2022-12-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v15.0.7...v15.0.8)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   [`40aa6fe`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/40aa6fe9055f3fe673fda7032c7da8958d3f574d) [#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/253) bump fs-minipass from 2.1.0 to 3.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The intent of the newly-added `--packages=external` setting is to exclude a package's dependencies from the bundle. Since a package's subpath imports are only accessible within that package, it's wrong for them to be affected by `--packages=external`. This release changes esbuild so that `--packages=external` no longer affects subpath imports.\n\n-   Forbid invalid numbers in JSON files\n\n    Previously esbuild parsed numbers in JSON files using the same syntax as JavaScript. But starting from this release, esbuild will now parse them with JSON syntax instead. This means the following numbers are no longer allowed by esbuild in JSON files:\n\n    -   Legacy octal literals (non-zero integers starting with `0`)\n    -   The `0b`, `0o`, and `0x` numeric prefixes\n    -   Numbers containing `_` such as `1_000`\n    -   Leading and trailing `.` such as `0.` and `.0`\n    -   Numbers with a space after the `-` such as `- 1`\n\n-   Add external imports to metafile ([#&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/905), [#&#8203;1768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1768), [#&#8203;1933](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1933), [#&#8203;1939](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1939))\n\n    External imports now appear in `imports` arrays in the metafile (which is present when bundling with `metafile: true`) next to normal imports, but additionally have `external: true` to set them apart. This applies both to files in the `inputs` section and the `outputs` section. Here's an example:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       \"inputs\": {\n         \"style.css\": {\n           \"bytes\": 83,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ]\n         },\n         \"app.js\": {\n           \"bytes\": 100,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-statement\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        },\n             {\n               \"path\": \"style.css\",\n               \"kind\": \"import-statement\"\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       },\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/app.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"require-call\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"exports\": [],\n           \"entryPoint\": \"app.js\",\n           \"cssBundle\": \"out/app.css\",\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"app.js\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 113\n             },\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 528\n         },\n         \"out/app.css\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 100\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    One additional useful consequence of this is that the `imports` array is now populated when bundling is disabled. So you can now use esbuild with bundling disabled to inspect a file's imports.\n\n### [`v0.16.5`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0165)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.4...v0.16.5)\n\n-   Make it easy to exclude all packages from a bundle ([#&#8203;1958](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1958), [#&#8203;1975](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1975), [#&#8203;2164](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2164), [#&#8203;2246](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2246), [#&#8203;2542](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2542))\n\n    When bundling for node, it's often necessary to exclude npm packages from the bundle since they weren't designed with esbuild bundling in mind and don't work correctly after being bundled. For example, they may use `__dirname` and run-time file system calls to load files, which doesn't work after bundling with esbuild. Or they may compile a native `.node` extension that has similar expectations about the layout of the file system that are no longer true after bundling (even if the `.node` extension is copied next to the bundle).\n\n    The way to get this to work with esbuild is to use the `--external:` flag. For example, the [`fsevents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) package contains a native `.node` extension and shouldn't be bundled. To bundle code that uses it, you can pass `--external:fsevents` to esbuild to exclude it from your bundle. You will then need to ensure that the `fsevents` package is still present when you run your bundle (e.g. by publishing your bundle to npm as a package with a dependency on `fsevents`).\n\n    It was possible to automatically do this for all of your dependencies, but it was inconvenient. You had to write some code that read your `package.json` file and passed the keys of the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, and/or `optionalDependencies` maps to esbuild as external packages (either that or write a plugin to mark all package paths as external). Previously esbuild's recommendation for making this easier was to do `--external:./node_modules/*` (added in version 0.14.13). However, this was a bad idea because it caused compatibility problems with many node packages as it caused esbuild to mark the post-resolve path as external instead of the pre-resolve path. Doing that could break packages that are published as both CommonJS and ESM if esbuild's bundler is also used to do a module format conversion.\n\n    With this release, you can now do the following to automatically exclude all packages from your bundle:\n\n    -   CLI:\n\n            esbuild --bundle --packages=external\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        esbuild.build({\n          bundle: true,\n          packages: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          Bundle:   true,\n          Packages: api.PackagesExternal,\n        })\n        ```\n\n    Doing `--external:./node_modules/*` is still possible and still has the same behavior, but is no longer recommended. I recommend that you use the new `packages` feature instead.\n\n-   Fix some subtle bugs with tagged template literals\n\n    This release fixes a bug where minification could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f(x) {\n      let z = y.z\n      return z``\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return y.z``}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return(0,y.z)``}\n    ```\n\n    This release also fixes a bug where using optional chaining with `--target=es2019` or earlier could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj?.foo)``;\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo)``;\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    var __freeze = Object.freeze;\n    var __defProp = Object.defineProperty;\n    var __template = (cooked, raw) => __freeze(__defProp(cooked, \"raw\", { value: __freeze(raw || cooked.slice()) }));\n    var _a;\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo).call(obj, _a || (_a = __template([\"\"])));\n    ```\n\n-   Some slight minification improvements\n\n    The following minification improvements were implemented:\n\n    -   `if (~a !== 0) throw x;` => `if (~a) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a | b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a | b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a & b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a & b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a ^ b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a ^ b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a << b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a << b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >>> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >>> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a || !!b) throw x;` => `if (a || b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a && !!b) throw x;` => `if (a && b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (a ? !!b : !!c) throw x;` => `if (a ? b : c) throw x;`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But when looking at the output, it seems as if the useDefineForClassFields is set to true.\r\n\r\nThis setting causes the following example to be compiled/transpiled incorrectly, causing undefined errors:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass XYZ extends W {\r\nprivate readonly whatever = this.query.watch(\r\n    {},\r\n    {\r\n      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',\r\n    },\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly query: GetSomething\r\n  ) {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar _XYZ = class extends W {\r\n  constructor(query) {\r\n    super();\r\n    __publicField(this, \"query\");\r\n    __publicField(this, \"whatever\", this.query.watch({}, {\r\n      fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n    }));\r\n    this.query = query;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the above example the constructor assignment is done last. I initially thought it was due to esbuild, so I had already opened an issue there which pointed me to the typescript config. (https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2738#event-8030504054)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is correct behaviour from typescript (the wrong order of assignment), or if this just isn't supported anymore?\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere's a typescript example with target: ES2021:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?useDefineForClassFields=true&target=8#code/MYGwhgzhAEAaCaAtaBTAHgFxQOwCYwHVoBvAKAAcAnASwDcwtpKUxcB7bEAT2gHcALBilopK0ALzQM-ahAB0ARwCuornN4Ng-ABSlo+kgF8ANHoNkDBgGYoMWgApsQ1YFwBc0AOTZbvNpQBrAFoObk9TSxMzAEoAblIzYA4IDEolYAx-XUsqOiEmFnZOHmVVDwBxWwBlNgBbWxlsAHMYkjN9CCVyUW04s0NSAYwubuhKjBr66WpmiWgwbC5SXBRQMGZoejECDwWloA\r\n\r\nAnd here's one with ES2022 as target\r\n\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?useDefineForClassFields=true&target=99#code/MYGwhgzhAEAaCaAtaBTAHgFxQOwCYwHVoBvAKAAcAnASwDcwtpKUxcB7bEAT2gHcALBilopK0ALzQM-ahAB0ARwCuornN4Ng-ABSlo+kgF8ANHoNkDBgGYoMWgApsQ1YFwBc0AOTZbvNpQBrAFoObk9TSxMzAEoAblIzYA4IDEolYAx-XUsqOiEmFnZOHmVVDwBxWwBlNgBbWxlsAHMYkjN9CCVyUW04s0NSAYwubuhKjBr66WpmiWgwbC5SXBRQMGZoejECDwWloA\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.3\r\nNode: 19.1.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1500.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.3 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                            7.6.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\nwebpack                         5.75.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"browser-esbuild target set to ES2022 and useDefineForClassFields false not working\" (#24435)"},{"Id":"1496412536","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-14T13:23:52","Actor":"Marius-Romanus","Number":"24433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Option to generate environments when creating a new Angular in versions 15 and higher","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to figure out the real reason for removing the environments in version 15 of the CLI, other than to simplify the configuration (which I'm fine with).\r\n\r\nBut I think it would at least be interesting to have an option (https://angular.io/cli/new#options) when creating a new Angular project to automatically generate the files as before, since in many cases the environments are still used.\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, the autogenerated files are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/environments/environment.ts\r\nsrc/environments/environment.prod.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges when generating angular.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"fileReplacements\": [\r\n         {\r\n          \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n          \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n         }\r\n ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nregards!\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBy default it would be the same as now, but by adding the \"--environments\" flag, it would remain the same as before version 15.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24433","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option to generate environments when creating a new Angular in versions 15 and higher\" (#24433)"},{"Id":"1496489890","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-14T12:06:47","Actor":"LeonEck","Number":"24434","RawContent":null,"Title":"browser-esbuild can't resolve secondary entry point from library","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI wanted to try the new esbuild based browser builder in a project that contains a library.

The default value is `undefined`, implying that either there are no children for the element, or these children are all visible in the UI. Which, in effect, is exactly the same as when the value is `true`. Thus, when the value of `aria-expanded` is anything other than `false`, it is actually equivalent to  `true`.\r\nIn this case, having `null` instead of  `false` results in having  `true` instead of  `false` -- meaning that users get the opposite of the intended information.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that blind users of screen readers are led to believe that the menu is displayed, whereas it's collapsed. This doesn't come from the screen reader actually, but from the browser that populates the accessibility API with the info it is fed with through the HTML code -- which is incorrect here.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Add a button with [matTriggerFor] for a mat menu\r\n<button mat-icon-button\r\n        #menuButton\r\n        [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"exampleMenu\">\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<mat-menu #exampleMenu=\"matMenu\">\r\n2. Inspect the accessibility information of the element in the browser, with the menu collapsed (\"States\" section in Firefox in the Accessibility view. In Chrome, check the Accessibility tab in the Inspector)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn the \"States\" section in Firefox, one item is \"Collapsed\" (no Expanded). In Chrome, the property Expanded is set to false\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn the \"States\" section in Firefox, one item is \"Expanded\". In Chrome, the property Expanded is set to true\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome (not checked but other browsers that follow the spec will show the same behavior)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): not relevant\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26281","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-menu) trigger is setting aria-expanded to null instead of false \" (#26281)"},{"Id":"1499864756","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-16T09:22:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26279","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/menu): aria-expanded not updating in an OnPush component","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the value for `aria-expanded` wasn't being updated when the menu is closed inside an OnPush parent.\r\n\r\nFixes #26262.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26279","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/menu): aria-expanded not updating in an OnPush component\" (#26279)"},{"Id":"1499826331","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-16T08:53:42","Actor":"tchandelle","Number":"26278","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(typography): migration to v15 error with `mat.define-legacy-typography-config` conversion","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading from v14 to v15, conversion of `mat.define-typography-config()` to `mat.define-legacy-typography-config()` is broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

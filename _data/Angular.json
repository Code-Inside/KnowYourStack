So\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// mycomponent.spec.ts\r\nconst fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);\r\nconst component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\nconst myspy = spyOn(component, 'someFunc');\r\n\r\n// when\r\ndoSomething();\r\n\r\n// then \r\nexpect(myspy).toHaveBeenCalled(); // Success\r\nexpect(component.someValue).toBe(true); // Fail\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n// mycomponent.ts\r\nsomeFunc = () => {\r\n  console.log('hello?');\r\n  this.someValue = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen spying on `someFunc`, the spy works for its intended purpose (seeing whether it's been called), but then immediately quits before running the code within. So any other checks, such as the second `expect` in this example, fail. Removing the spy makes the code run as expected.\r\nThe same goes for e.g. a console.log I put at the top of that function, so it's not just the actual check that somehow fails.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.12.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47111","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Test runner does not execute code when using spy\" (#47111)"},{"Id":"1334604466","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-10T13:10:27","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"47110","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: rename duplicate header","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I use the \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\" with the Webpack CompressionPlugin, because i want my build files being compressed. To not have the compressed and uncompressed files in the dist directory, the 'deleteOriginalAssets' property is set to true. But the @angular-devkit/build-angular module wants to calculate the statistics and needs the deleted files. In version 9 it just returns 0 for the sizes.

You should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `~0.14.0`. See the documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Implement the Yarn Plug'n'Play module resolution algorithm ([#&#8203;154](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/154), [#&#8203;237](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/237), [#&#8203;1263](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1263), [#&#8203;2451](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2451))\n\n    [Node](https://nodejs.org/) comes with a package manager called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which installs packages into a `node_modules` folder. Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within `node_modules`, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). While Yarn can install packages using `node_modules`, it also offers a different package installation strategy called [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp/), which is often shortened to \"PnP\" (not to be confused with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is an entirely different unrelated package manager).\n\n    Plug'n'Play installs packages as `.zip` files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read `./some.zip/lib/file.js` actually automatically extracts `lib/file.js` from `./some.zip` at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system.\n\n    Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the [`@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp) plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a `.zip` file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside `.zip` files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API).\n\n    With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a `.pnp.js`, `.pnp.cjs`, or `.pnp.data.json` file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need `@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp` anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as `module` and `browser` in `package.json` files within `.zip` files should now be respected.\n\n    Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find `--log-level=verbose` helpful.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.54.4`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1544)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.54.3...1.54.4)\n\n-   Improve error messages when passing incorrect units that are also\n    out-of-bounds to various color functions.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is almost always true except for spread arguments, which are not syntactically valid on their own and which have the side effect of causing iteration, which might have further side effects. Now esbuild will wrap these elements in an unused array so that they are syntactically valid and so that the iteration side effects are preserved.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.16`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8416)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.15...8.4.16)\n\n-   Fixed `Root` AST migration.\n\n### [`v8.4.15`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8415)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.14...8.4.15)\n\n-   Fixed AST normalization after using custom parser with old PostCSS AST.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v16.1.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1610-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1600v1610-2022-08-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v16.0.0...v16.1.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   use an `xpath` query handler ([#&#8203;8730](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8730)) ([5cf9b4d](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5cf9b4de8d50bd056db82bcaa23279b72c9313c5))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   resolve target manager init if no existing targets detected ([#&#8203;8748](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8748)) ([8cb5043](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/8cb5043868f69cdff7f34f1cfe0c003ff09e281b)), closes [#&#8203;8747](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8747)\n-   specify the target filter in setDiscoverTargets ([#&#8203;8742](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8742)) ([49193cb](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/49193cbf1c17f16f0ca59a9fd2ebf306f812f52b))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

That has its pros and cons. It's great, but regardless of it, there are several issues to be solved. Especially when it comes to module development. Mainly it's about build size, traffic and performance. This issue is about collecting ideas and finding a good solution. Let be begin and explain in the following case: \r\n\r\nDeveloping an Angular app with lazy loaded modules (routing / loadChildrean) is great and using modules the way to go. But using the Angular Material components bloats the build size. Even if you don't use a shared material module. For example, if you have 10 components with it's own module, and every component uses the mat-card, mat-button or whatever. This means that the build size includes 10 times the same components. This should be avoided. But how? Avoiding modules in my app? Maybe there is a way in Angular. But Idk. Some devs create a shared module which contains all material components / modules. And importing it in every app module. In general, you'll use nearly all components of an framework in an app. This issue is about finding a way to load Material once for the whole app.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nReduce build size and traffic. Improve performance and usability. \r\n\r\n### More information\r\n\r\nYou can use the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build --prod --stats-json && webpack-bundle-analyzer ./dist/demoapp/stats-es2015.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild a new app with routes and several modules. Lazy load routes with `loadChildren`.\r\n\r\nRelated trivia: In SCSS there are several ways to use other files. Either `@import` or `@use`. You should prefer `@use`. Because the file is only imported once. No matter how many times you use `@use` in your project. It's another point, don't be confused. This project already uses the right way. It's just a similar topic and the desired behavior of this framework in Angular at TS module level. I want to load Material only once.

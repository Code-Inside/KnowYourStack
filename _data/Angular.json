I tried below suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Delete node_modules, delete package.lock.json, clear the npm cache, clear the .angular cache, restart VS code, do npm i, ng serve.\r\n- Check for circular dependency in application and resolve it.\r\n- If you are using custom pipe in application, don't mention them in imports of ngModule, mention them in providers.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.

We could write for every component checks if the object will be present onInit if its null etc. From my personall experience this leads to bigger and less maintainable code structure.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI suggest angulars takes a look to add either a new pipe @Required - which I have an example for, or extend the existing one @Input to additionally provide a object with meta data if its required, what value are allowed etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@RequiredInputs()\r\n@Component({\r\n...\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n   readonly data$ = new ReplaySubject<string[] | undefined>();\r\n\r\n  @Input() @Required() set data(data: string[] | undefined) { // By default undefined, null and NaN are forbidden.

Of course I could make another observable in my TS file and combineLatest them but this means I would need to that for every scenario in my HTML and it dosent make much sence to combine them in the TS if all I want is to display a loading animation.\r\n\r\nI went trough a few possible solutions and think this could be a standard Angular feature. I'm open for discussions and suggestions but as far as the testing / working of the idea goes it seems to work fine. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose we have a similar async pipe but it would work only for keys of observables, this way you can keep your HTML clean and robust. The following code will recreate an object based on the current one but with the catch that it will map all observables to another object with the returned values from the stream.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"{ myData$, selectedItems$, myPromise$ } | await as props; else loading\">\r\n  <my-multi-selector\r\n    [selectedItems]=\"props.selectedItems$.value\"\r\n    [data]=\"props.myData$.value\"></my-multi-selector>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #loading>\r\n  <div>Loading...</div>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRegarding the implementation I made a sample app which I tested and it seems to work fine. There is a catch to my code and that is that I catch the object and compare references - this is completely fine if you use the code as above written but there is an issue if you e.g. create your object in TS and then dynamically change the keys (adding / removing keys will cause issues without creating a new instance of the object itself).\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by removing the comparison of the references of the new and old object but since this isn't a pure pipe I considered the performance impact and since this would be used only in HTML anyway I think this is the best possible solution - again I'm open for discussion.\r\n\r\nLink of example: https://github.com/muhamedkarajic/angular-playground/blob/main/src/app/shared/pipes/await.pipe.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46948","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"await / async (props) of Observables | Promises etc\" (#46948)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1320239519","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-28T00:05:34","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23650","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add shard and test type/name information to test logging","State":"open","Body":"Log info that I found useful.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23650","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: add shard and test type/name information to test logging\" (#23650)"},{"Id":"1320231519","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-27T23:49:00","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23649","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: move tempdir creation to util method","State":"open","Body":"To put the login in a common location.

The presence of this file and its purpose may be confusing for new developer.\r\n- When referencing your static assets places in `assets` folder, you have to add the `./assets/` prefix in all your URLs. When you different kind of assets, you often end up with URLs like `./assets/images/my-image.jpg` adding an extra prefix, making your URLs longer.\r\n- There's no way to add static files at the root of your `dist` folder directly without modifying the build in `angular.json` config.\r\n- If you start to add static files to be copied at the root of your `dist` folder, your `src/` folder will start to be cluttered. Moreover, you'll have to add an entry fo each of the new files you want to add in the `angular.json` config.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI propose a small change in the structure that would solve all these issues at once:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsrc/\r\n  |- public/\r\n  |  |- index.html\r\n  |  |- favicon.ico\r\n  |- ...\r\n```\r\nAnd the `assets` section of `angular.json` becomes:\r\n```json\r\n            \"assets\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n                \"input\": \"src/public\",\r\n                \"output\": \".\"\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing all the issues listed above, this makes the starter template simpler, and use the same convention as all other major frameworks (ie Vue, React, Svelte...) for static assets.\r\nI don't see any drawbacks from making this change, beside a small change in habits.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to accept this change, I'm willing to make the PR for it 🙂 \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI considered 3 alternatives for the solution:\r\n\r\n- Same solution as above, but putting everything  under `assets/` folder instead of `public`:\r\n  * May be confusing for existing Angular developer, as this would remove the need for `./assets/` prefix in URLs\r\n  * Static files like `index.html` can't really be called `assets`\r\n\r\n- Keep existing `assets/` folder and add a `public/` folder\r\n  * Doesn't solve the first 2 issues\r\n  * May be confusing as to the difference between the two folders\r\n  * `assets/` folder becomes redundant\r\n\r\n- Same solution as above, but using a more explicit `static/` folder name instead of `public`:\r\n  * The `public` convention is already used in a lot of frameworks and tools in the web ecosystem, so it doesn't feel right to add *yet another convention*.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23644","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Proposal] Simplify starter template by moving all static files and assets in a single folder\" (#23644)"},{"Id":"1319173192","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-27T08:01:46","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23642","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly respond to preflight requests","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nWith this commit, we add a middleware that handles preflight requests as currently responses for this type of requests returning 404.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary workaround until this issue is fixed upstream.

Is there anything I'm missing?\r\n\r\n\r\nWebpack production configuration (webpack.prod.js):\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nconst AngularWebpackPlugin = require('@ngtools/webpack').AngularWebpackPlugin;\r\n...\r\n\r\nmodule:\r\n    {\r\n        rules:\r\n            [                                       \r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[cm]?js$/,\r\n                    use: {\r\n                        loader: 'babel-loader',\r\n                        options: {\r\n                            cacheDirectory: true,\r\n                            compact: false,\r\n                            plugins: ['@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel'],\r\n                            },\r\n                        },\r\n                    },\r\n                {\r\n                    test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\r\n                    loader: '@ngtools/webpack',\r\n                    include: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"app\")],\r\n                    exclude: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"node_modules\")]                \r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        plugins:\r\n            [                   \r\n                new AngularWebpackPlugin({\r\n                        tsconfig: './tsconfig.json'\r\n                })\r\n            ]\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nTypeError: Invalid host defined options\r\n    at eval (eval at initializeCompilerCli (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\@ngtools\\webpack\\src\\ivy\\plugin.js:532:40), <anonymous>:3:1)\r\n    at AngularWebpackPlugin.initializeCompilerCli (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\@ngtools\\webpack\\src\\ivy\\plugin.js:532:95)\r\n    at D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\@ngtools\\webpack\\src\\ivy\\plugin.js:128:73\r\n    at Hook.eval [as callAsync] (eval at create (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:8:17)\r\n    at Hook.CALL_ASYNC_DELEGATE [as _callAsync] (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\Hook.js:18:14)\r\n    at Compiler.compile (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\Compiler.js:1092:28)\r\n    at D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\Compiler.js:517:12\r\n    at Compiler.readRecords (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\Compiler.js:929:11)\r\n    at D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\Compiler.js:514:11\r\n    at Hook.eval [as callAsync] (eval at create (D:\\myapp\\node_modules\\webpack\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:15:1)\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n@ngtools/webpack: 13.3.9\r\nNode: 14.17.1\r\nWebpack: 5.55.1\r\nwebpack-cli: 4.8.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm using require to import the AngularWebpackPlugin, would this make a difference?

The Angular-Library gets build with `ng build my-lib --watch --configuration development` and gets linked (after successful build) in the Angular-App with the command `npm link ../mylib/dist/my-lib`. So far so good... It works - i can start my app with `ng serve` and and i can use the \"my-lib\" dependencies without any problem. \r\n\r\nIf i now start actively developing in the existing library entry points, my library starts to build again - everything fine so far. But stop! If i take a look into the package.json of my successful build files (inside of dist directory) the package.json version is the same as before. So my App with the active ng-serve does not get any notification of the changes.\r\n\r\nAccording to issue [20962](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20962#issuecomment-863476476) - if i understood it correctly - an Angular Library should \"stamp\" the current build inside of the package.json and update the version with something like: 0.1.2+0123456789. But thats not gonna happen! If i update a component or a module of an existing entry point, Angular does not update the version in the package.json of the dist folder.

The `angular.json` file has the `i18nDuplicateTranslation` option set to `\"error\"` in the browser builder.\r\n\r\nThe output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNINGS:\r\n - Duplicate messages with id \"test\":\r\n   - \"first\" : src\\app\\app.component.html:1\r\n   - \"second\" : src\\app\\app.component.html:2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nI expect that with `i18nDuplicateTranslation` set to `\"error\"`, the duplicate message IDs will be logged as errors _and_ that the process exits with a non-zero exit code.\r\n\r\nInstead, the duplicate message IDs are logged as a warning, and the process exits with an exit code of zero.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n> ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.0\r\nNode: 16.12.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, it seems like this might be a simple fix. 🤞 \r\n\r\nThe duplicate message IDs are checked here with a hard-coded value of \"warning\" and then always logged as warnings:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1b89fd43400455366a3054f6ada10fb0dae5a209/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/extract-i18n/index.ts#L273-L283\r\n\r\nEarlier in the same function, the browser target options are fetched here, which should contain the value of the `i18nDuplicateTranslation` option:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1b89fd43400455366a3054f6ada10fb0dae5a209/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/extract-i18n/index.ts#L138-L141\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"extract-i18n does not respect the i18nDuplicateTranslation option\" (#23635)"},{"Id":"1315989757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-25T09:50:09","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"23632","RawContent":null,"Title":"`require` is failing in 3rd party library when running `ng test`","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [x] test\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nDon't know\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI've been searching for similar issues but haven't found anything related until I missed something. `require` calls are not proceeded by webpack in 3rd party libraries.

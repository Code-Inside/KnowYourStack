Useful when trying to avoid import conflicts.\r\n3. `feat(@schematics/angular): add bootstrap-agnostic utilities for writing ng-add schematics` - This is the commit that adds the two new

@alan-agius4 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n// 16.0.3\r\nRun `ng new project-name`    \r\n\r\nUpdate tsconfig.json to\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompilerOptions: {\r\n   \"target\": \"ES2015\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following line of code to AppComponent.ts:\r\n\r\n    person = null ?? { name: 'Simon' };`\r\n\r\nRun `ng serve`\r\n\r\nView `main.js` in browser and observe that the code has been transpiled:\r\n\r\n    this.person = false ? 0 : {\r\n        name: 'Simon'\r\n    };\r\n\r\nWith `target` set to `ES2022` the `??` remains:\r\n\r\n    this.person = null ?? {\r\n        name: 'Simon'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThe code is still being transpiled, despite the warning message telling me it has been up-targeted to ES2022.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 18.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli,

Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24435, but that is related to `useDefineForClassFields` and not `target`.\r\n\r\nSee my answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75047760/typescript-target-warnings-after-angular-15-update/76369523#76369523\r\n\r\nThe main reason this is an issue is because you can observe your user code is transpiled, but Angular / vendor code is not - which may lead to a false sense of security if needing to target older browsers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25290","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Application code is not being 'up-targeted' to ES2022 despite warning message from CLI\"

The application works fine without the \"optimization\" flag set to true in the angular.json file. But when set to true, some code remains in the main....js that causes an error, when the page gets loaded.\r\nThe console log states \"main.bc110eb6fa951c13.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: hd is not defined\". \r\nHere is the part of the code, that causes this issue:\r\n\r\n`class EP extends hd {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation (and also turning off the optimization flag), I found out that this code originally looked like that:\r\n\r\n`\r\nclass ReferenceExpr extends ExpressionBase {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo the ExpressionBase class is missing. Which is also fine, I guess, since it is not used in the code and hence was removed by tree shaking. Also the ReferenceExpr class is, as far as I can tell, not used in the code. When I search for a usage of the class \"EP\" in the optimised code, there is no location where I could find it. \r\n\r\nVersion 15.2.4 worked without any issues. Did I miss anything in the upgrade process, or is it a bug in the build optimisation?\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nmain.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: hd is not defined\r\n    at 83 (main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:290279)\r\n    at a (runtime.de42e30e1a22c589.js:1:143)\r\n    at main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:4227714\r\n    at n (runtime.de42e30e1a22c589.js:1:951)\r\n    at main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:55\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25287","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tree shaking: unused code remains in productive app\" (#25287)"},{"Id":"1732612002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-30T18:51:21","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25288","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly emit AOT class metadata in development","State":"closed","Body":"When using the default Webpack-based builder, the AOT-generated class metadata was incorrectly removed in all cases.

At the time I started, what I was thinking of was specific to a set of tables I intended to use in an administrative context, so I navigated to something like /src/modules/sales/costing-tool/components/templates and typed \"ng g c admin-table\". \r\n\r\nBefore I hit enter, I thought about it and decided that rather than creating a module and specific use component that I'd rather make a general use component for generating p-tables dynamically & that it belonged in a shared module rather than a feature module. I thought I'd already deleted the CLI command out of the terminal so without looking I typed cd.. and hit enter. Which was the beginning of a 2+ hour headache that ended up costing me 2 days of work and which potentially could've cost me all the work I've done since May 5. \r\n\r\nSo the command I effectively entered was \"ng g c admin-tablecd..\", and what happened is that the CLI was able to somehow dodge the OS level naming safety conventions & it created a folder named admin-tablecd.., which caused there to be an unresolvable reference in my project structure and made it unloadable and unbuildable. And there was nothing I could do to delete the offending folder. I tried deleting it through the UI, using DOS commands, using WSL commands including rmdir with the -rf flag, nothing would get rid of it, even after a reboot. I had just about resolved myself to having to clone my latest remote to a new local repo which would've set me back to the 5th when I tried rmdir with the \"\\\\?\\c:\\path\\to\\bad\\directory\" syntax which finally worked.\r\n\r\nI think that optimally the generate command should respect naming safety conventions, or minimally provide a complimentary command to remove generated components. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nVia the CLI, generate a component with a name that ends in a directory traversal operator, i.e. new-componentcd..\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nThe system cannot find the file or directory specified\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1502.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core         15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   15.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular          15.2.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nCan't think of anything.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25282","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate command should respect file name safety conventions.\" (#25282)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1738812902","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T20:51:07","Actor":"steven-curran-ub","Number":"27228","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): NVDA announces entire week of dates when dialog opens","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPosting for our team's accessibility expert:\r\n\r\nOur accessibility expert found that in NVDA 2023.1, when a user opens the datepicker dialog, the screen reader announces the entire next week of dates from the focus date. \r\n**We did not observe this behavior with JAWS 2023 or VoiceOver on MacOS 13.4.**\r\n\r\nRelated, turning off the default \"Automatic Say All on Page Load\" setting in NVDA (under Preferences > Browse Mode) does \"remedy\" the issue.

Go back to the focused slider and try to drag the other handle (which is currently not focused)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After (3), the focus ripple disappears from the slider.\r\n- In (4), you can normally click/drag the slider handle\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The slider's handle remains focused no matter what you do with the rest of the page.\r\n- The other handle of the slider does not react to click/drag. Its interactivity only gets restored after I click on the focused handle one more time.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16\r\n- CDK/Material: 16\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27225","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(slider): Right click on a slider makes it permanently focused and unresponsive\" (#27225)"},{"Id":"1737747463","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T17:18:46","Actor":"cristal2431","Number":"27222","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Material forms): No directive found with exportAs 'matMenu' in angular 16.0.3","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have below code which works find in angular version 13, however in latest version I am getting the error mentioned here..\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-menu #failedDiscussion=\"matMenu\">\r\n</mat-menu>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n<mat-menu #failedDiscussion=\"matMenu\">\r\n</mat-menu>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo error\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nbug(Material forms): No directive found with exportAs 'matMenu' in angular 16.0.3\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27222","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Material forms): No directive found with exportAs 'matMenu' in angular 16.0.3\" (#27222)"},{"Id":"1738454856","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T16:03:57","Actor":"TheConstructor","Number":"27224","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(@angular/material): Style doesn't build with yarn pnp","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAs reported in #24128 and maybe fixed in #24536 using yarn in pnp mode means, that there is no predefined path-relation between @angular/material and @angular/cdk.

This widget takes a value as an input and sets it to the form control bound to the slider:\r\n```\r\n// template\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input matSliderThumb [formControl]=\"sliderValue\">\r\n</>\r\n\r\n// component\r\n@Input() value: number\r\n\r\nsliderValue = new FormControl(0, {nonNullable: true})\r\n\r\nngOnChanges() {\r\n  this.sliderValue.setValue(this.value) // <-- this\r\n\r\n  // derived value used in the template\r\n  this.isDefaultValue = this.value === 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the `.setValue` call breaks change detection. The `isDefaultValue` value is properly derived (as per console.log output), but is not reflected in HTML.

It seemed appropriate to pull from the Material spec for these.  The use of \"Large body text\" and \"Medium body text\" is meant to help bridge the gap to the eventual shift to M3, since those type levels equate to [M3's Large and Medium body text](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens#d74b73c2-ac5d-43c5-93b3-088a2f67723d), respectively. \r\n\r\nI also tweaked the second table to give greater emphasis to the class names that match the typography levels when more than one class is mapped to a style.

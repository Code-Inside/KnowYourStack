This is almost always true except for spread arguments, which are not syntactically valid on their own and which have the side effect of causing iteration, which might have further side effects. Now esbuild will wrap these elements in an unused array so that they are syntactically valid and so that the iteration side effects are preserved.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.16`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8416)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.15...8.4.16)\n\n-   Fixed `Root` AST migration.\n\n### [`v8.4.15`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8415)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.14...8.4.15)\n\n-   Fixed AST normalization after using custom parser with old PostCSS AST.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v16.1.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1610-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1600v1610-2022-08-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v16.0.0...v16.1.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   use an `xpath` query handler ([#&#8203;8730](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8730)) ([5cf9b4d](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5cf9b4de8d50bd056db82bcaa23279b72c9313c5))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   resolve target manager init if no existing targets detected ([#&#8203;8748](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8748)) ([8cb5043](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/8cb5043868f69cdff7f34f1cfe0c003ff09e281b)), closes [#&#8203;8747](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8747)\n-   specify the target filter in setDiscoverTargets ([#&#8203;8742](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8742)) ([49193cb](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/49193cbf1c17f16f0ca59a9fd2ebf306f812f52b))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Create a component and add any CSS styles to it.\n2. Inside the component’s template:\n- Add an HTML element and apply an Angular animation (`@angular/animations`) or a CSS animation to it.\n- Add a sibling HTML element without animations.\n3. Use this component in the App Component template.\n4. Remove the component by:\n- Using `*ngIf` or `@if` on the component itself or its parent wrapper.\n- Calling `.remove()` on a parent wrapper element.\n5. Observe in Chrome DevTools → Memory tab:\n- The animated element remains as a detached node.\n- All sibling elements and the removed parent remain in memory as detached nodes.\n- A detached CSSStyleDeclaration object is also present.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- No detached nodes should remain in the Chrome DevTools → Memory tab.\n- The CSSStyleDeclaration object should also be released if no other elements reference it.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n- The animated element remains as a detached node.\n- All sibling elements and the removed parent remain in memory as detached nodes.\n- A detached CSSStyleDeclaration object is also present.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/animation-memory-leaks\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nN/A\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.0\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.0\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.0\n@schematics/angular          19.2.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.8.2\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn my implementation, there are two examples:\n- The first one demonstrates the behavior without a wrapping element (`@if` is applied directly to the list of child components).\n- The second one applies `@if` to a wrapping `<div class=\"wrapper\">` element that contains the list of child components.\n\nIn the **first example**, you can observe that the nodes without animations (`<app-no-animations>`) - along with all their children and their CSSStyleDeclaration - are properly removed from memory:\n\n<img width=\"1918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfff2ce7-5798-40e4-a46d-684ce1a17041\" />\n\nIn the **second example**, however, even `<app-no-animations>`, all its children, and their CSSStyleDeclaration remain in memory as detached nodes. This likely occurs because they share a common parent node (`<div class=\"wrapper\">`) with the animated components, and when this wrapper is removed from the DOM, all its children persist as detached. Notably, `<div class=\"wrapper\">` itself also remains in memory as a detached node after removal.\n\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4c3a504-38ea-4db3-8400-9ee0ba890384\" />\n\nThe same behavior is observed when removing the wrapper not with `@if`, but directly using `el.remove()` (via the second button):\n\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/158025d4-b25b-4d34-b930-b8d7f1049720\" />\n\nAdditionally, I want to highlight that if animations are never activated, elements are removed from memory properly. To demonstrate this, I created a component where the animation only triggers on a hover event. As long as the element is never hovered, it is properly removed from memory. However, if it is hovered even once, it remains detached after removal:\n\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b34ed3d9-78d5-48aa-8257-c780e4e48c09\" />\n\nYou can also experiment with the provided checkboxes, which allow you to manually remove the animated elements from the child components inside `ngOnDestroy()`. This successfully removes some nodes from memory, but some of them still remain:\n\n<img width=\"1918\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6d0353-52b2-4abc-b35d-23c791c9cac0\" />\n\nThe issue is also re-producible on Angular v.18.2. I haven't checked with earlier versions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60265","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Memory Leak: Elements with Angular/CSS Animations Remain in Memory After Removal (@if, *ngIf, el.remove())\" (#60265)"},{"Id":"2905481594","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T15:05:23","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60293","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): log a warning instead of throwing error on `OutputRef…","State":"open","Body":"….emit` when the directive is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis should not be a hard error, as nothing bad happens but the users should be warned that no event will be emitted.\r\n\r\nfixes #60110\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60293","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): log a warning instead of throwing error on `OutputRef…\" (#60293)"},{"Id":"2905373177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T11:37:11","Actor":"user4783","Number":"60292","RawContent":null,"Title":"N","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nn\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nn\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nn","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60292","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"N\" (#60292)"},{"Id":"2905044319","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-08T22:16:48","Actor":"kyubisation","Number":"60290","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): support custom elements for RouterLink","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is due to the lack of automatic href updates for elements besides `<a>`/`<area>` and the internal logic of adding a `tabindex=\"0\"` attribute for non `<a>`/`<area>` elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nIf `routerLink` is used on a registered custom element, the static property/getter `observedAttributes` on the custom element class is checked for an `href` attribute. If `href` is part of `observedAttributes` treats the element as if it was a native `<a>` element.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60290","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): support custom elements for RouterLink\" (#60290)"},{"Id":"2904968614","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-08T22:09:30","Actor":"GrandSchtroumpf","Number":"60288","RawContent":null,"Title":"<search> tag not recognized: 'search' is not a known element:","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlanguage-service\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe <search> tag is not recognized by the language service even if its supported by all major browsers\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/search\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nWrite <search> on any template\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n'search' is not a known element\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 19.2.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60288","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"<search> tag not recognized: 'search' is not a known element:\" (#60288)"},{"Id":"2904965830","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-08T18:59:15","Actor":"Rafik-Belkadi-malou","Number":"60287","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgraded to v19 from v18 HMR issue at serve","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen running nx run client:serve , i'm getting this error after upgrading to v19 :\n```\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fileName')\n      at extractHmrMetatadata (file:///Users/rafikbelkadi/Desktop/recapp/node_modules/.pnpm/@angular+compiler-cli@19.2.1_@angular+compiler@19.2.1_@angular+core@19.2.1_rxjs@7.8.2_zone.j\n```\n\nhere is my config: \n```\n \"serve\": {\n      \"configurations\": {\n        \"development\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:development\",\n          \"hmr\": true\n        },\n        \"local\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:local\",\n          \"hmr\": true\n        },\n        \"production\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:production\"\n        }\n      },\n```\n\nwhen i disable `HMR` it solves the issue ..\n```\n\nserve\": {\n      \"configurations\": {\n        \"development\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:development\",\n          \"hmr\": false\n        },\n        \"local\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:local\",\n          \"hmr\": false\n        },\n        \"production\": {\n          \"buildTarget\": \"client:build:production\"\n        }\n      },\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n✘ [ERROR] Angular compilation emit failed.

I want to propose something:\nThe last days I was working with reactive forms in our app and I saw that exist 2 ways to reset a form object (reactive one), one is using the method called .reset() inside of formGroup variable, in this method you can pass a value as input + if you want to emit changes + onlyself.\n\nThe other way is to use formGroupDirective + with the method called resetForm(), I was checking the code inside of the repo and I saw that this method, apart from doing another stuffs, just use .reset() internally.\n\nThe problem with that is .resetForm() is the only way to reset submitted status of the form, but this is gonna trigger any observable that is listening about form changes.\n\nThe only work around that I saw to solve this is using a filtering inside of my observable to not trigger it when the state of the form is submitted, but I think that could exist a better way to do it.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy proposal have 2 possibles ways:\n1. add the possiblity to set a second optional parameter to resetForm method as the same way as .reset() method inside of form variable.\n2. expose a new api to just reset the submitted state of the form as well as you can reset the value of the form and states too.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf exist a way to do what Im explaining here, please let me know it because I didn't see any info related to do that inside of angular documentation (angular.dev)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60274","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose an API to reset the submitted state of a form\" (#60274)"},{"Id":"2903164400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-07T14:33:47","Actor":"Humberd","Number":"60273","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): move reload method from Resource to WritableResource","State":"open","Body":"Now only mutable resources can be reloaded\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60273","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): move reload method from Resource to WritableResource\" (#60273)"},{"Id":"2903120901","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-07T14:16:18","Actor":"Humberd","Number":"60272","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): narrow error type for resources API","State":"open","Body":"It used to return `unknown`.\r\nNow it's `Error | unknown`.\r\n\r\nFor non-`Error` types they are encapsulated in new `UnknownError` class.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60272","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): narrow error type for resources API\" (#60272)"},{"Id":"2903001026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-07T13:30:51","Actor":"NoelLH","Number":"60270","RawContent":null,"Title":"Using SSR and `withFetch()` on HTTP client leads to brower CORS errors","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nFollowing the Angular CLI's advice, I added `withFetch()` to my `provideHttpClient()` call when I upgraded to Angular 19.\n\nThis seemed stable in many contexts until we noticed some HTTP client data loading failing intermittently. Eventually I found that when caching wasn't masking the problem and a \"cold\" SSR load was involved, CORS in the browser was always failing.\n\nCORS is supported by the APIs involved here but the response headers allowing the origin are set dynamically based on a permitted `Origin` header being sent on the request. It seems like when a resolver such as `CampaignListResolver` has been run on the server with no `Origin`, the result is shared with the browser without consideration of the CORS implications and then the browser is unable to use the data even though the browser can see it, because of the CORS error.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a workaround I could or should be using or if the framework should handle this. I'm also not aware of a previous version of Angular where this works out the box `withFetch()`, so I've marked it as not a regression. However, not using this mode – so the default XmlHttpRequest method is used – allows SSR and CORS to work with the same API.\n\nSorry the repro link is a whole app and not smaller. There are quite a lot of moving parts including the server, so I can't quickly put together anything more focused.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/thebiggive/donate-frontend/blob/18c75853eba24215cc14bf928767d9922bd91bc7/src/app/app.module.ts#L78\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nBrowsers report something like \"Cross-Origin Request Blocked ...

dist\n\n\npackage.json\n```\n\"imports\": {\n    \"#configs/*\": \"./browser/configs/*.js\"\n}\n```\nin the source code the configs folder is live in \"src/configs\" but copied at build time into \"dist/browser/configs\"\nthe same goes for many dynamic imports that assume the app runs inside the dist dir, i.e. the paths may be differ from the corresponding paths in the source code.\n\nI suppose the pretender should run the same way as the original app runs i.e. from dist.\n\nanother thing, I cannot find an option to totally disable the prerendering as `prerender: false` now has no effect\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment

patterns within npm modules are not acknowledged by Angular's sass-resolvers with the use of `@use` at-rule","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nGiven the following within a module's package.json, Angular's sass resolvers aren't working as expected with patterns defined in `export` objects with the use of `@use` / `@import` as expected with new Angular application breaking the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) for Sass authors of all levels. \n\n`package.json`  \n```json\n{\n\"name\": \"@example/core-styles\",\n\"files\": [\n    \"styles\"\n  ],\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/_index.scss\"\n    },\n    \"./*.scss\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/*.scss\"\n    },\n    \"./*.sass\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/*.sass\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n`src/styles.scss`\n```scss\n@use \"@example/core-styles\";\n@use \"@example/core-styles/base.scss\" as base;\n\n@include base.styles();\n```\n\n## Expected Output\nBoth sass files are loaded\n\n## Actual Output\nThe `index.scss` file will load as expected but not the individual Sass modules within the same package written as-is unlike how the use of `@use` and `@import` is documented by the Sass programming language and the behavior of  other sass resolvers historically–this includes [Sass's built-in package importer].\n\nInstead, Angular sass resolvers force the sass files to be explicitly defined contrary to the intent of the sass glob patterns unlike other Sass resolvers (including sass's native `pkg:` npm package resolver) or import sass modules prefixed with `_`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@example/core-styles\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"styles\"\n  ],\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/_index.scss\"\n    },\n    \"./base.scss\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/_base.scss\"\n    },\n    \"./*.scss\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/*.scss\"\n    },\n    \"./*.sass\": {\n      \"sass\": \"./styles/*.sass\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nOR \n\n```scss\n@use \"@example/core-styles\";\n\n// This is contradictory how Sass modules prefixed with _ are supposed to be imported! \n@use \"@example/core-styles/_base.scss\" as base;\n\n@include base.styles();\n```\n\nI'm of the opinion this breaks the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) for Sass authors of all levels, including even AI agents attempting to follow the spirit of how Sass modules are supposed to be work within the language's documentation and the documentation + bug issue of the langauge's built-in package manager. \n\n## Proposed Solutions\n1) Angular sass-resolvers better respect export glob patterns associated with Sass\n\n2)  Angular default Sass module for all preset build variants (`application`, `browser`, and `browser-esbuild` goes ahead and support by default Sass's built-in package importer–or at minimum support the `@use pkg:<module>` syntax.  \n\nSass's built-in package import is stable for some time now (at least about a year); it seems like an unnecessary or fruitless endeavor in 2025 for Angular dev tools to insist on a proprietary way for devs and/or sass stylesheet stakeholders to load Sass files in a new Angular application moving forward. \n\nThe use of Sass's built-in package import would resolve the issue consistent with other envrionments that support modern Sass as the following:\n\n```scss\n@use \"pkg:@example/core-styles/base\" as base;\n```\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIssue occurs with any attempt to build or run an Angualr app with this intended use of modules beyond the index sass file of a NPM Package consisting of Sass files\n\nFor example commands such as `npm serve`, `npm build` and so on. \n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n✘ [ERROR] Can't find stylesheet to import.\n  ╷\n2 │ @use

You can specify in a configuration settings inside the `configurations` array the index file. \n\n```\n...\n\"ja\": {\n  \"localize\": [\"ja\"],\n  \"index\": {\n    \"input\": \"src/locale/index/index.ja.html\",\n    \"output\": \"index.html\"\n  },\n  \"fileReplacements\": [\n    {\n      \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\n      \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.ja.ts\"\n    }\n  ]\n},\n...\n```\n\nThis enables you to create translations of your `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to improve SEO. \n\nIf you run `ng build --configuration=ja` the `index.ja.html` is applied for the localization of the app. If you only run `ng build` the configuration is ignored because the default configuration is applied (`index.html` is used).\n\nThis is annoying for applications that serve multiple localizations and want to leverage the SEO of translated meta tags.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA compiler setting to allow the usage of custom a `index.html` per localization.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nA workaround is to create a script that compiles the with each configuration and merge them in the end in a custom `dist` folder. This increases the compile time by the _number of available localizations_ and increases automated runner costs.\n\nThere is currently no other way to achieve the desired outcome than this workaround.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular/localize use specified index.html in angular.json for localizations during

[`eb56a5e`](https://redirect.github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/commit/eb56a5e09964e49045bccde3c616275eb0a0902d) Thanks [@&#8203;JounQin](https://redirect.github.com/JounQin)! - fix: separate the `/flat` entry for compatibility\n\n    For flat config users, the previous `\"eslint-config-prettier\"` entry still works, but `\"eslint-config-prettier/flat\"` adds a new `name` property for [config-inspector](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-config-inspector/), we just can't add it for the default entry for compatibility.\n\n    See also

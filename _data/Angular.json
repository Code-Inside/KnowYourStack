After I refresh the website it works fine. \r\n\r\nThe injection inside `CanActivateFn` function does not retrieve the latest signal value after the signal is updated.\r\n\r\nThis is the `CanActivateFn`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const RegisteredGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\r\n  return inject(AuthService).isUserInRoles(['registered']) ? true : inject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['/login']);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const AllContentGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\r\n  return !environment.protectAllContentWithAuthentication ? true :\r\n    inject(AuthService).isUserInRoles(['registered']) ? true : inject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['/login']);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the `AuthService`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class AuthService {\r\n  auth: WritableSignal<IAuth | undefined>;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private cookieService: CookieService,\r\n    private nav: NavigationService,\r\n    private notification: NotificationService\r\n  ) {\r\n    this.auth = this.initAuth();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private initAuth() {\r\n    return signal(this.getCookieAuth());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private getCookieAuth() {\r\n    const auth = this.cookieService.get('auth');\r\n    return auth ? JSON.parse(auth) : undefined;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  setAuth(auth: IAuth) {\r\n    // Set cookie to expire in 30 days\r\n    this.cookieService.set(\r\n      'auth',\r\n      JSON.stringify(auth),\r\n      environment.authExpiresAfter\r\n        ? new Date(Date.now() + environment.authExpiresAfter)\r\n        : undefined\r\n    );\r\n    this.auth.set(auth);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  removeAuth() {\r\n    this.cookieService.delete('auth');\r\n    this.auth.set(undefined);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  logout() {\r\n    this.removeAuth();\r\n    this.notification.success('You have been logged out');\r\n    this.nav.navigateByUrl('/login');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  isUserInRoles(roles: string[]) {\r\n    return this.auth()?.roles?.some((r) => roles.includes(r)) ?? false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my `app-route`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n  ...accountRoute,\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: LayoutComponent,\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: '',\r\n        component: IndexPageComponent,\r\n        pathMatch: 'full',\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'index',\r\n        component: IndexPageComponent,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'account',\r\n        component: ProfilePageComponent,\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    canActivate: [AllContentGuard],\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that all of my content is guarded by `AllContentGuard`. The user has to be logged in to be able to see the content. The problem here is that this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  isUserInRoles(roles: string[]) {\r\n    return this.auth()?.roles?.some((r) => roles.includes(r)) ?? false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes not get the `this.auth()` values correctly. It gives me `undefined`, even after I set the auth from this `login-page.component.ts`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  async login() {\r\n    this.loading.set(true);\r\n    const res = await this.http.post<IAuth>('/login', null, {\r\n      email: this.email(),\r\n      password: this.password(),\r\n    });\r\n    this.loading.set(false);\r\n\r\n    if (res) {\r\n      if (res.error) {\r\n        this.notification.error(res.msg);\r\n      } else if (res.data) {\r\n        this.auth.setAuth(res.data);\r\n\r\n        // If user is not confirmed, redirect to confirm email page\r\n        if (!res.data.confirmed) {\r\n          this.notification.warning(this.str()('emailNotConfirmed'));\r\n          setTimeout(() => this.nav.navigateByUrl('/confirm-email'), 1000);\r\n        } else {\r\n          this.notification.success(this.str()('loginSuccess'));\r\n          this.nav.navigateToIndex();\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI even tried to setup the navigation wrapped in `setTimeout()` to see if there is delay for the signal updates, but it is the same.\r\n\r\nThe problem only occurs when I go to `http://localhost:4201` as my app is hosted. If I refresh the page immediately after I open the website, it works fine, but not when first opening the web.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs only when I go to `http://localhost:4201`, which is redirected to `http://localhost:4201/login`. If I go by typing `http://localhost:4201/login`, it works fine.\r\n\r\nSo the flow is like this:\r\n\r\nFirst open website -> go to `http://localhost:4201` -> got redirected for the first time from `CanActivateFn` by `AllContentGuard` to `http://localhost:4201/login` -> login and sets the auth -> Then the guard always retrieves undefined auth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nOk so, after getting redirected by the guard `AllContentGuard`, the guard loses the connection to the auth signal. It is no longer able to get the update from the signal.\r\n\r\nDoes redirecting using this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['login'])\r\n```\r\nremoves the connection with the signal? I am not sure\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.0.6\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                    16.0.6\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.1.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.6\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CanActivateFn Does Not Retrieve The Latest Signal Value After Being Redirected By Guard\" (#51196)"},{"Id":"1827404401","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-29T09:24:41","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"51197","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typos in component overview guide","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I am using the new experimental option for the `provideHttpClient()` - `withFetch()`, and the ng-select package (latest version 11.0.0) inside my app's navbar to search for users from the API (autocomplete).\r\n\r\nToday, I added a router guard (functional guard) to my main page. The guard is something like:\r\n `return inject(AuthService).login()`, which creates an HTTP request to the backend. The guard is working as expected, and I've been using this approach for years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the combination of `withFetch()` and the `authGuard` is causing a strange bug: The ng-select component is not working properly - it doesn't show a list of items (even though the API calls appear in the network tab), the CSS is a bit off (the input is on top of the placeholder), among other strange behaviors.\r\n\r\nJust by removing either `withFetch()` or the authGuard, everything works as expected. So, it seems the combination of the two is creating side effects on the ng-select component.\r\n\r\nI updated to Angular 16.1.6, but the bug persists. I have another app that works with ng-select, Angular 16, and authGuard without any issues. I have a lot of experience with Angular, and this is a strange one. I'm not sure if anyone will know the cause, especially without a reproduction of the bug. But if no one has a clue, I'll do my best to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo errors on the console at all.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 16.1.4 \\ 6\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\n\r\nElectron: 25\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI am running angular inside electron app, but this is not releated to Electron in my opinion, since I can also run the angular app in the browser directly (localhost:4200) and I see the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n- Everything is working as expected without the guard\r\n- If the guard is not using http request (ie, just returns of(true)) - no problem\r\n- No errors in the console, the http requests for the guard and the ng-select autocomplete is working and getting valid respones (200) using fetch api","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51181","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"withFetch() and router guard create random bug\" (#51181)"},{"Id":"1823441391","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-27T01:25:01","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"51182","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] refactor(compiler): apply component metadata asynchronously when defer blocks are present","State":"open","Body":"⚠️ **Disclaimer** ⚠️ **this PR uses a syntax that is still in an open RFC.

CSS nesting allows selectors to be used where declarations are expected. There's an IE7 hack where prefixing a declaration with a `*` causes that declaration to only be applied in IE7 due to a bug in IE7's CSS parser. However, it's valid for nested CSS selectors to start with `*`. So esbuild was incorrectly parsing these declarations and anything following it up until the next `{` as a selector for a nested CSS rule. This release changes esbuild's parser to terminate the parsing of selectors for nested CSS rules when a `;` is encountered to fix this edge case:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%; height: 1px; {\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    .item {\n      *width: 100%;\n      height: 1px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that the syntax for CSS nesting is [about to change again](https://togithub.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7961), so esbuild's CSS parser may still not be completely accurate with how browsers do and/or will interpret CSS nesting syntax. Expect additional updates to esbuild's CSS parser in the future to deal with upcoming CSS specification changes.\n\n-   Adjust esbuild's warning about undefined imports for TypeScript `import` equals declarations ([#&#8203;3271](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3271))\n\n    In JavaScript, accessing a missing property on an import namespace object is supposed to result in a value of `undefined` at run-time instead of an error at compile-time. This is something that esbuild warns you about by default because doing this can indicate a bug with your code. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    console.log(styles.buton)\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    // styles.js\n    export let button = {}\n    ```\n\n    If you bundle `app.js` with esbuild you will get this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Import \"buton\" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in \"styles.js\" [import-is-undefined]\n\n            app.js:2:19:\n              2 │ console.log(styles.buton)\n                │                    ~~~~~\n                ╵                    button\n\n          Did you mean to import \"button\" instead?\n\n            styles.js:1:11:\n              1 │ export let button = {}\n                ╵            ~~~~~~\n\n    However, there is TypeScript-only syntax for `import` equals declarations that can represent either a type import (which esbuild should ignore) or a value import (which esbuild should respect). Since esbuild doesn't have a type system, it tries to only respect `import` equals declarations that are actually used as values. Previously esbuild always generated this warning for unused imports referenced within `import` equals declarations even when the reference could be a type instead of a value. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only warn in this case if the import is actually used. Here is an example of some code that no longer causes an incorrect warning:\n\n    ```ts\n    // app.ts\n    import * as styles from './styles'\n    import ButtonType = styles.Button\n    ```\n\n    ```ts\n    // styles.ts\n    export interface Button {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.63`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae...7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9)\n\n### [`v23.0.62`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c...30759e7766cd2605c2fd68fd14c10812b83042ae)\n\n### [`v23.0.61`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e...378f9237f1af09f6be29651e133b3a8738b49c7c)\n\n### [`v23.0.60`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/ca0de89246e2512361d04a3598f4006f3d7f4e8f...dfff7ce879deca58cec6813d3cc238c2060e4d7e)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This assumption might not necessarily be true if Critters is unable to resolve the content of the linked styles.

This causes ES Modules in the output with non-configurable methods/properties. As a result, we cannot mock JS modules. This leads to tests that pull lots of external dependencies (utility functions, config objects etc.) that are not provided using the DI and hence cannot be stubbed using Angular DI.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nScaffold an app and use Jest as a testing tool. Modify AppComponent.ngOnInit\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  if (isDevMode())  {\r\n    console.log('dev');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the test try to stub the `isDevMode`.\r\n\r\n```\r\njest.mock('@angular/core', () => ({\r\n    ...jest.requireActual('@angular/core'),\r\n    isDevMode: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(false)\r\n}))\r\n\r\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\r\n    let component: AppComponent;\r\n\r\n    beforeEach(() => {\r\n        component = new AppComponent()\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    describe('ngOnInit', () => {\r\n        it('should not log when in prod mode', () => {\r\n            const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log')\r\n            component.ngOnInit()\r\n            expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled()\r\n        });\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nTest fail due to a number of reasons which are related to ES Build in the end:\r\na. ES Build outputs a module with a different name and there is a mismatch\r\nb. ES Build embeds a module (e.g. import of the environments file)\r\nc.

The documentation for this component is still poor, so it's entirely possible that I'm not understanding the proper use.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [YouTube documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters), `listType` can be `playlist` or `user_uploads`.  However, the Angular project will not build successfully when I attempt to set `listType` to any value.  There also doesn't seem to be a `ListType` enum exposed, like some of the other properties (such as `AutoPlay`, etc.).  This would be helpful in feeding it a proper value since it clearly doesn't like the strings `playlist` or `user_uploads`.\r\n\r\nLooking in the \"Type definitions for YouTube\", it seems like there _should_ be `ListType` type exported, but I'm not sure how to make use of it and I'm not seeing it in the `YT` namespace.  Interestingly, the index.d.ts file for the type definitions defines the first potential value for `ListType` as `player` - not `playlist`.  This seems to be inconsistent with the YouTube documentation.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n`<youtube-player [playerVars]=\"playerVars\"></youtube-player>`\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayerVars = {\r\n    autoplay: 1,\r\n    controls: 1,\r\n    list: 'LISTID',\r\n    listType: 'playlist',\r\n    modestbranding: 1\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFull support for the PlayerVars object, per the YouTube documentation\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nbuild errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypes of property 'listType' are incompatible.\r\n    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ListType | undefined'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.1.6\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(youtube-player): PlayerVars\" (#27528)"},{"Id":"1824286462","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-27T16:53:29","Actor":"Abdullah-Haroon004","Number":"27526","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkScrollable is working but its scroll-bar is not visible in IPAD Device and Iphone Devices.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe Scrolling feature is working on IPAD Devices as well as the drag-and-drop item scroll.

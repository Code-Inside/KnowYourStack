My concern is that new Angular devs are going to start using this new API without taking into consideration that the `loaderFn` will run at creation time if a request is added in the definition and has a value other than `undefined`. \n\nConsider a plain app without lazy loading components or modules, at the start when the app boots all components that create a `resource` and have a value in the `request` signal will go and trigger the `loaderFn` degrading page loading performance.\n\nIt should behave like Observables combined with `switchMap` operators that run computations the first time a subscriber is added to the Observable\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nInside the `loadEffect` you could check for  `liveConsumers.length` if there are no `consumers` and `lazy` is set to `true` then no call to `loaderFn` is made.\n\n```\n\nif (request.request === undefined) || (this.value[SIGNAL] as SignalNode<T>).liveConsumers.length === 0 ) {\n  return\n}\n```\n\n**BUT**: i don't know how to trigger the `loaderFn` when new consumer are added to the array with the current api\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/929db81f968141da1706c6713e8f4d1b67b8e6fb/packages/core/src/resource/resource.ts#L197\n\nIt's similar to `set` function checking for the version:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/929db81f968141da1706c6713e8f4d1b67b8e6fb/packages/core/src/resource/resource.ts#L71\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nnone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58422","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add lazy property to ResourceOptions interface\" (#58422)"},{"Id":"2622472108","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T22:49:58","Actor":"Jordan-Hall","Number":"58421","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone with infer imports","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

After that time, it will move into\n\"Maintenance\" until end of life in April 2027.\n\nOther than updating metadata, such as the `process.release` object, to reflect\nthat the release is LTS, no further changes from Node.js 22.10.0 are included.\n\n##### OpenSSL 3.x\n\nOfficial binaries for Node.js 22.x currently include OpenSSL 3.0.x (more\nspecifically, the [quictls OpenSSL fork](https://redirect.github.com/quictls/openssl)).\nOpenSSL 3.0.x is the currently designated long term support version that is\nscheduled to be supported until 7th September 2026, which is within the expected\nlifetime of Node.js 22.x. We are expecting upstream OpenSSL to announce a\nsuccessor long term support version prior to that date and since OpenSSL now\nfollows a semantic versioning-like versioning scheme we expect to be able to\nupdate to the next long term supported version of OpenSSL during the lifetime of\nNode.js 22.x.\n\n### [`v22.10.0`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.10.0): 2024-10-16, Version 22.10.0 (Current), @&#8203;aduh95\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/compare/v22.9.0...v22.10.0)\n\n##### Notable Changes\n\n##### New `\"module-sync\"` exports condition\n\nThis release introduces a `\"module-sync\"` exports condition that's enabled when\n`require(esm)` is enabled, so packages can supply a synchronous ES module to the\nNode.js module loader, no matter if it's being required or imported. This is\nsimilar to the `\"module\"` condition that bundlers have been using to support\n`require(esm)` in Node.js, and allows dual-package authors to opt into ESM-first\nonly on newer versions of Node.js that supports `require(esm)` to avoid the\ndual-package hazard.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"node\": {\n      // On new version of Node.js, both require() and import get\n      // the ESM version\n      \"module-sync\": \"./index.js\",\n      // On older version of Node.js, where \"module-sync\" and require(esm) are\n      // not supported, use the CJS version to avoid dual-package hazard.\n      // When package authors think it's time to drop support for older versions of\n      // Node.js, they can remove the exports conditions and just use \"main\": \"index.js\".\n      \"default\": \"./dist/index.cjs\"\n    },\n    // On any other environment, use the ESM version.\n    \"default\": \"./index.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr if the package is only meant to be run on Node.js and wants to fallback to\nCJS on older versions that don't have `require(esm)`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    // On new version of Node.js, both require() and import get the ESM version\n    \"module-sync\": \"./index.js\",\n    // On older version of Node.js, where \"module-sync\" and require(esm) are\n    // not supported, use the CJS version to avoid dual-package hazard.\n    // When package authors think it's time to drop support for older versions of\n    // Node.js, they can remove the exports conditions and just use \"main\": \"index.js\".\n    \"default\": \"./dist/index.cjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For package authors**: this only serves as a feature-detection mechanism for\npackages that wish to support both CJS and ESM users during the period when some\nactive Node.js LTS versions support  `require(esm)` while some older ones don't.\nWhen all active Node.js LTS lines support `require(esm)`, packages can simplify\ntheir distributions by bumping the major version, dropping their CJS exports,\nand removing the `module-sync` exports condition (with only `main` or `default`\ntargetting the ESM exports). If the package needs to support both bundlers and\nbeing run unbundled on Node.js during the transition period, use both\n`module-sync` and `module` and point them to the same ESM file. If the package\nalready doesn't want to support older versions of Node.js that doesn't support\n`require(esm)`, don't use this export condition.\n\n**For bundlers/tools**: they should avoid implementing this stop-gap condition.\nMost existing bundlers implement the de-facto bundler standard\n[`module`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/#providing-commonjs-and-esm-version-stateless)\nexports condition, and that should be enough to support users who want to bundle\nESM from CJS consumers. Users who want both bundlers and Node.js to recognize\nthe ESM exports can use both `module`/`module-sync` conditions during the\ntransition period, and can drop `module-sync`+`module` when they no longer need\nto support older versions of Node.js. If tools do want to support this\ncondition, it's recommended to make the resolution rules in the graph pointed by\nthis condition match the Node.js native ESM rules to avoid divergence.\n\nWe ended up implementing a condition with a different name instead of reusing\n`\"module\"`, because existing code in the ecosystem using the `\"module\"`\ncondition sometimes also expect the module resolution for these ESM files to\nwork in CJS style, which is supported by bundlers, but the native Node.js loader\nhas intentionally made ESM resolution different from CJS resolution (e.g.\nforbidding `import './noext'` or `import './directory'`), so it would be\nbreaking to implement a `\"module\"` condition without implementing the forbidden\nESM resolution rules. For now, this just implements a new condition as\nsemver-minor so it can be backported to older LTS.\n\nContributed by Joyee Cheung in [#&#8203;54648](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54648).\n\n##### `node --run` is now stable\n\nThis CLI flag runs a specified command from a `package.json`'s `\"scripts\"` object.\n\nFor the following `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"node --test-reporter junit --test ./test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can run `node --run test` and that would start the test suite.\n\nContributed by Yagiz Nizipli in [#&#8203;53763](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53763).\n\n##### Other notable changes\n\n-   \\[[`f0b441230a`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/f0b441230a)] -

fixes","State":"closed","Body":"Includes the following changes that fix issues raised during internal tests of the `inject` migration:\r\n\r\n### refactor(migrations): hoist uninitialized members to top of class if they are not combined in the internal migration\r\n\r\nWhen the internal mode for the `inject` migration is enabled, we find properties without initializers, we add their initializers and we prepend the `inject` calls before them. The remaining properties that couldn't be combined are left in place. This appears to break some internal cases.\r\n\r\nThese changes work around the issue by hoisting all the non-combined members above the `inject()` calls. This should be safe, because they don't have initializers and as such can't have dependencies.\r\n\r\n### fix(migrations): inject migration not inserting generated code after super call in some cases\r\nFixes an issue where the `inject` migration was generating and attempting to insert code after a `super` call, but the string buffering implementation was dropping it if the statement right after the `super` call was deleted as a result of the migration.\r\n\r\n### refactor(migrations): inject migration internal mode incorrectly migration properties initialized to identifiers\r\nFixes that when the `inject` migration in internal mode was starting to visit the nodes one level down from the root when considering whether an expression contains local references. This lead it to skip over top-level identifiers and migrate some code incorrectly.\r\n\r\n### fix(migrations): inject migration always inserting generated variables before super call\r\nFixes that if a class has a `super` call, the `inject` migration would always insert the generated variable before it, even if there's other code before the `super` call.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58393","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Several inject migration fixes\" (#58393)"},{"Id":"2618723810","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-28T19:38:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58392","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): account for anonymous classes in internal utility","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `getClosestComponentName` utility was reporting an empty string if it encounters an anonymous class.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58392","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): account for anonymous classes in internal utility\" (#58392)"},{"Id":"2618720798","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-28T15:11:16","Actor":"thecp","Number":"58391","RawContent":null,"Title":"NullInjectorError shows wrong component with missing provider","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen injecting a pipe, e.g. DatePipe, directly into a component via inject or constructor, one has to register this pipe somewhere via the providers array metadata. When not doing so, there will be a NullInjectorError at runtime telling, which provider is missing. However the error does not indicate the correct component where the provider is actually missing. In the example provided here the error indicates that the component which is used for routing is missing the provider but it's actually one of its child components. (I think the error, or the component in the error message, always falls back to any routed component and won't be shown in any child component)\n\nInstead of ` ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeRoutedComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]` I would have expected ` ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeChildComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]`\n\nThere might be technical reasons why this is the case but in my opinion this is wrong and it's at least highly confusing...\n\nPS: I believe this should already be checked at build time but this is a different story.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/thecp/NullInjector-Message-Reproduction\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\ncore.mjs:7195 ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_SomeRoutedComponent])[_DatePipe -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for _DatePipe!\n    at NullInjector.get (core.mjs:1636:21)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at R3Injector.get (core.mjs:3018:27)\n    at ChainedInjector.get (core.mjs:5289:32)\n    at lookupTokenUsingModuleInjector (core.mjs:5632:31)\n    at getOrCreateInjectable (core.mjs:5678:10)\n    at ɵɵdirectiveInject (core.mjs:11586:17)\n    at ɵɵinject (core.mjs:1102:40)\n    at inject (core.mjs:1187:10)\nhandleError\t@\tcore.mjs:7195\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.10\n@angular/cli                    18.2.10\n@schematics/angular             18.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAlso tested this with the newest next Version but the problem persists.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NullInjectorError shows wrong component with missing provider\" (#58391)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2622672524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-30T02:01:11","Actor":"muuvmuuv","Number":"28742","RawContent":null,"Title":"indexHtmlTransformer is missing in buildApplication","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nI am currently trying to prepare `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild` for NG19 and saw that `@angular/build` `buildApplication` has no `indexHtmlTransformer` like dev-server has.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSame `extensions` for `buildApplication` as for dev-server's `execute`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28742","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"indexHtmlTransformer is missing in buildApplication\" (#28742)"},{"Id":"2622423189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T22:09:41","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"28741","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): adds `protractor` builder which throws with a clear error message","State":"open","Body":"This should help users who upgrade more easily discover that the builder has been removed and find the resources needed to migrate any existing tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28741","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): adds `protractor` builder which throws with a clear error message\" (#28741)"},{"Id":"2622186245","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T19:49:26","Actor":"thecp","Number":"28740","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prerendering fails with undefined stack trace on invalid http calls","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using SSR, you typically wrap http calls in an afterRender or afterNextRender lifecycle hook. If not doing so it might happen that prerendering fails when e.g. the url is either invalid, unreachable or does not return JSON. In this you'll get an error which doesn't really tell you a lot of context what is going on:\n\n```\n✘ [ERROR] An error occurred while prerendering route '/test'.\n\nundefined\n```\n\nMy expectation is that there should be some better error message to tell the user what (s)he is doing wrong.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Set up a project with SSR and routing enabled\n2. add router-outlet to the app.component\n3. set up some routing, e.g.\n```\n  {\n    path: 'test',\n    component: TestComponent,\n  },\n  {\n    path: '',\n    redirectTo: '/test',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n  }\n```\n4. In a component of any route (in this case the TestComponent), set up an http call like:\n```\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient) {\n    this.http\n      .get('htp://invalid.url')\n      .subscribe();\n  }\n```\n5. run ng build\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n✘ [ERROR] An error occurred while prerendering route '/test'.\n\nundefined\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 22.9.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.10\n@angular/cli                    18.2.10\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.10\n@schematics/angular             18.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28740","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prerendering fails with undefined stack trace on invalid http calls\" (#28740)"},{"Id":"2618855786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T17:19:43","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"28730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Karma builder doesn't watch files with \"builderMode: application\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsing the `\"builderMode\": \"application\",` option in the Karam builder breaks `ng test` watch capabilities\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a new project with `npx @angular/cli@19.0.0-next.13 new karma-watch --defaults --no-routing`\nAdd `\"builderMode\": \"application\",` to `angular.json` in the `karma`options.\nLaunch `ng test`\nUpdate any file of the project like `app.component.ts` or `app.component.spec.ts`: the tests don't run again.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0-next.13\nNode: 20.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0-next.11\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0-next.13\n@angular/cli                    19.0.0-next.13\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0-next.13\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28730","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Karma builder doesn't watch files with \"builderMode: application\"\" (#28730)"},{"Id":"2621850765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T17:19:42","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28739","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix --watch regression in karma","State":"closed","Body":"Outside of single-run mode, the karma test provider was expected to watch for changes.

This allowed to propagate values via injection token retrieved in `server.ts` to the application. \n\nNot knowing if there is a better approach, those values usually are:\n- configurations that must be available also in the angular application. Those values are always present during SSR and sometimes are needed also on the browser, so TransferState is needed to propagate them\n  - [app.config.ts](https://github.com/riccardoperra/angular-ssr-repro/blob/aa7b0c50698d981d52446a3043a594d6b69ea21b/18-ssr/src/app/app.config.ts#L16) : example of a token always valuated in both ssr and browser\n- server only object that allow to update the request data (e.g. update response headers / status code) / redirect\n  - Main use cases are for example the possibility to change the page status to 404 if the requested resource does not exist, preserving navigation.\n- static values that must be fetched only on server bootstrap and reused across all requests.\n\nAn important use case is that those value **could be used** into other application-level providers, in order to configurate them based on the request providers.\n\nWith the new `AngularAppEngine` in v19, I saw from @JeanMeche reproduction that you can pass custom values into the `requestContext` parameter when you render the app ([server.ts](https://github.com/JeanMeche/ssr-v19/blob/eef03da8ab1d2836b135e32f041b62fdb698a9f5/server.ts#L39)), however I have noticed some unusual behaviors that make me think I can't do the same things:\n\n- Those values are not always valuated. It seems that there is a case (the first request?) where those values are null.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ec5320-9ed8-4c1c-9184-1d49edbc352f)\n\nLike the screenshot above, (reproducible with `npm run start` into the v19-ssr folder), after the server, the log just show that the first request invoke 2 time the application bootstrap: the first time values in request context (inject via `REQUEST_CONTEXT` token) are null, the second one are valuated. This is critical since the first time an error is thrown, the application breaks.\n\n- Cannot modify request headers/status: with the new native `Response` object, it seems that we are not allowed anymore to update it imperatively into the angular application.

In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"},{"Id":"2615017503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T20:11:50","Actor":"FlorinCiocirlan","Number":"29926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in function comment","State":"open","Body":"There is a typo in file _**[components](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main)/[src](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src)/[cdk](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk)/[schematics](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics)/[update-tool](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics/update-tool)/index.ts**_\n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_form_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */\n\nshould be \n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_from_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typo in function comment\" (#29926)"},{"Id":"2614399233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T15:16:29","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29925","RawContent":null,"Title":"merge material.angular.io repo","State":"open","Body":"Used git-filter-repo to rewrite history, so commits appear to have always been beneath the `material.angular.io` folder.\r\n\r\nFollows https://blog.aspect.build/otherrepo-to-monorepo\r\n\r\nNote, this MUST be a merge commit so care should be taken when merging to prevent squashing the history and losing the git blame layer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29925","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"merge material.angular.io repo\" (#29925)"},{"Id":"2613213774","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T06:31:01","Actor":"caleniuc","Number":"29923","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAnchor): aria-disabled not applied with disabledInteractive","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`MAT_ANCHOR_HOST` applies `aria-disabled` differently than `MAT_BUTTON_HOST`.

The result of this is that, on the first dirty-check of the table, the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating all the `<th mat-header-cell>` elements and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\nThis phenomenon only occurs on the FIRST click post-column-add, and only if you include the 2nd (sub)header in your table definition, i.e. commenting out `<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>` mitigates the bug.\n\n# Possible root cause of the bug\n\nI think this is happening because Angular somehow rerenders the subheader as a result of dirty-checking the header, but does not update its internal records of the subheader's state in the process. Clicking the button causes the table to re-check its subheader's columns, at which point its differ discovers it hasn't officially added the newest column to the list (although it is already visually displaying the newest column).\n\nThis bug disappears if I modify `CdkTable._renderUpdatedColumns` in the following manner at [angular/components/src/cdk/table/table.ts:1087](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L1087):\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => \n    acc || !!def.getColumnsDiff();\n```\n\nFixed code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => {\n    const diff = def.getColumnsDiff();\n    return acc || !!diff;\n  };\n```\n    \nI think that the lazy computation of `def.getColumnsDiff()` is causing the subheader state not to get updated.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nThere is no exception. The error is that, when the user clicks their first button on a table header, all the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating each `<th mat-header-cell>` element and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"xokrrnnaegq.angular\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.4.0\",\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.6.4\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.8.29\",\n    \"hammerjs\": \"2.0.8\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"angular-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.5.4\",\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^18.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.10.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~7.0.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.8\",\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\n    \"karma\": \"~3.0.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.2\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"protractor\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.11.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.1.1\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers\" (#29922)"},{"Id":"2610922876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T09:00:28","Actor":"azimuthdeveloper","Number":"29919","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(treeview): Add guide on how to migrate from old treeview to new treeview","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the sudden deprecation of the various tree controllers, it would be nice if there were some kind of documentation on how to remove tree controller and migrate to the new way of doing things.

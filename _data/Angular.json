The example shows that `UserServiceConfig` is singleton, not `UserService`. The `UserService` is not singleton, because it is not following `forRoot()` pattern. But, see the comments within live example. This is wrong comments, isn't it?:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Proves that UserService is an app-wide singleton and only instantiated once\r\n// IFF shared.module follows the `forRoot` pattern.\r\n//\r\n// If it didn't, a new instance of UserService would be created\r\n// after each lazy load and the userName would double up.\r\nimport { Injectable, Optional } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nlet nextId = 1;\r\n\r\nexport class UserServiceConfig {\r\n  userName = 'Philip Marlowe';\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log('UserServiceConfig is created')\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class UserService {\r\n  id = nextId++;\r\n  private _userName = 'Sherlock Holmes';\r\n\r\n  constructor(@Optional() config: UserServiceConfig) {\r\n    if (config) { this._userName = config.userName; }\r\n    console.log('UserService is created');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get userName() {\r\n    // Demo: add a suffix if this service has been created more than once\r\n    const suffix = this.id > 1 ? ` times ${this.id}` : '';\r\n    return this._userName + suffix;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could see the `UserSerivce` is not following `forRoot()` pattern, but `UserServiceConfig` is following the pattern:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports:      [ CommonModule ],\r\n  declarations: [ TitleComponent ],\r\n  exports:      [ TitleComponent ],\r\n  providers:    [ UserService ] // UserSerivce is declared at providers. It is not making this singleton.\r\n})\r\nexport class CoreModule {\r\n  constructor (@Optional() @SkipSelf() parentModule: CoreModule) {\r\n    if (parentModule) {\r\n      throw new Error(\r\n        'CoreModule is already loaded. Import it in the AppModule only');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static forRoot(config: UserServiceConfig): ModuleWithProviders {\r\n    return {\r\n      ngModule: CoreModule,\r\n\r\n      // But, UserServiceConfig is a singleton, because it is following the pattern.\r\n      providers: [\r\n        {provide: UserServiceConfig, useValue: config }\r\n      ]\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can prove the `UserService` is not singleton by adding the `console.log()` within constructor:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class UserServiceConfig {\r\n  userName = 'Philip Marlowe';\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log('UserServiceConfig is created'); // log\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class UserService {\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  constructor(@Optional() config: UserServiceConfig) {\r\n    if (config) { this._userName = config.userName; }\r\n\r\n    console.log('UserSerivce is created'); // log\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `CustomersComponent` has declared `UserService` as a provider, we have to remove the provider: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h2>Customers of {{userName}}</h2>\r\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n  `,\r\n  providers: [ UserService ] // <--- remove it from providers\r\n})\r\nexport class CustomersComponent {\r\n  userName = '';\r\n  constructor(userService: UserService) {\r\n    this.userName = userService.userName;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, `UserService` is injected into `CustomersComponent` as a singleton. Nevertheless,  `UserService` is still not singleton. Because, `CoreModule` doesn't force it as a singleton. Currently, `UserService` is injected into `CustomersComponent` from parent injector(application root injector). We also have to use `forRoot()` pattern to `UserService` too, to force it as singleton.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n\r\ndocs : https://angular.io/guide/singleton-services#forroot\r\nlive example : https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/ngmodules/stackblitz.html\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\nWhenever we visit Customer menu, `UserService` is created.

As a result, newly released versions would be picked, resulting in unexpected, non-deterministic breakages in CI.\r\n\r\nThis commit calls `yarn install` with the `--pure-lockfile` option instead. As a result, only the Angular packages (for which the locally built ones are used) and their peer dependencies are unpinned; the pinned versions from `yarn.lock` are used for all other (direct and transitive) dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhile this does not eliminate non-determinism across builds, it significantly reduces it.\r\n\r\n**build(docs-infra): use pinned dependencies when possible in `ng-packages-installer`**\r\n\r\nPreviously, `ng-packages-installer` would replace the version ranges for all dependencies that were peer dependencies of an Angular package with the version range used in the Angular package. This effectively meant that the pinned version (from `yarn.lock`) for that dependency was ignored (even if the pinned version satisfied the new version range).\r\n\r\nThis commit reduces non-determinism in CI jobs using the locally built Angular packages by always using pinned versions of dependencies for Angular package peer dependencies if possible.\r\n\r\nFor example, assuming the following versions for the RxJS dependency:\r\n\r\n- **aio/package.json**: `rxjs: ^6.3.0`\r\n- **aio/yarn.lock**: `rxjs@^6.3.0: 6.3.3`\r\n- **@angular/core#peerDependencies**: `rxjs: ^6.0.0`\r\n\r\n...the following versions would be used with `ng-packages-installer`:\r\n\r\n- Before this commit:\r\n  - **aio/package.json**: `rxjs: ^6.0.0`\r\n  - **node_modules/rxjs/**: `6.4.0` (latest version satisfying `^6.0.0`)\r\n- After this commit:\r\n  - **aio/package.json**: `rxjs: ^6.3.0`\r\n  - **node_modules/rxjs/**: `6.3.3` (because it satisfies `^6.0.0`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28510","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): use pinned dependencies as much as possible when using local Angular packages\" (#28510)"},{"Id":"406168742","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T03:18:28","Actor":"jinbeomhong","Number":"28508","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Hierarchical Injectors document is a bit misleading.","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe document says following:\r\n\r\n> You can configure a provider at the module level using the providedIn metadata option for a non-root NgModule, in order to limit the scope of the provider to that module.\r\n\r\nBut, we can't limit the scope of providers declared in NgModule, unless the module is lazy loaded.

Description\r\nIt would be a great feature to have the possibility to add the newly generated component|class|service|... to a barrel file when using the ng generate <c|s|class|...>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe barrel exportation could be an option that is defaulted to false. The exportation would be in the module of the generated item if any index.ts file is present:\r\n#### Examples\r\n##### The folder diagram\r\n```\r\n\r\no\r\n| --core\r\n|   | --core.module.ts\r\n|   | --index.ts  // core module's barrel\r\n|   | --services\r\n|   `-- models\r\n|-- pages\r\n|   |-- pages.module.ts\r\n|   |-- index.ts // pages module's barrel\r\n|   |-- dashboard\r\n|   |   |-- dashboard.module.ts\r\n|   |   `-- index.ts  // dashboard module's barrel. \r\n|    | `-- about\r\n|       |-- about.module.ts // This module doesn't have any barrel\r\n|       `-- about // about component folder is exported in index.ts of about module's barrel\r\n    `-- shared // more folder for style\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Generating a module with barrels enabled\r\n```\r\nng g m pages/about\r\n```\r\nGenerate a module without any barrels in it. If the user had specified `-b` an `index.ts` file would have been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new service with the shorthand syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate service core/services/myService -b\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new service named MyService and it is exported in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the core folder\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component with the long syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate component pages/dashboard/dash --barrel\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named DashComponent in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the dashboard folder.\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b\r\n```\r\nThis still generate the component, but does not add anything to any barrel because the module it belongs to doesn't have one\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b=pages\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named MeComponent in specified module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the pages folder.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThere is currently a library doing this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby, but we have to run a separate command everytime we create a new item, a lot of configuration is needed as well and there is a devDependency.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Barrel generation options\" (#13590)"},{"Id":"406333658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T13:39:01","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"13589","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): update terser-webpack-plugin","State":"open","Body":"Fix #13582","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13589","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular/cli): update terser-webpack-plugin\" (#13589)"},{"Id":"406308086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T12:30:35","Actor":"V3nsla","Number":"13588","RawContent":null,"Title":"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHtml changes are not detected in library when starting project using ng serve --aot. Library is built using --watch flag and main project is served with --aot. On html change build and serve process are triggered and page refreshes but with no changes in html. Typescript changes are visible  after rebuild. Html change is only visible when you restart ng serve --aot process. \r\n\r\nWithout --aot flag everything is working as intended. \r\n\r\nSame problem exists with npm linked external library (not in the same project).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI made a small repro of the problem: https://github.com/V3nsla/aot-lib-html-changes\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem build library using --watch flag (ng build lib --watch) and start main project using ng serve --aot. \r\n\r\nMake some changes in the template of LibComponent and save to trigger build process. After main project is recompiled html changes are not reflected. \r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.0\r\nNode: 10.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.0\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.0\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13588","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"\" (#13588)"},{"Id":"406241475","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T09:29:22","Actor":"hussyd","Number":"13587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI 7.3.0 generated angular.json contains src/styles.sass entry instead of .scss extension","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

It can now however seem like this plugin is mistakenly always included.\r\n\r\n1. Even though I specify `\"sourceMap\": false` in `angular.json`\r\n\r\n2. Config is [normalized](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/karma/index.ts#L42-L46)\r\n\r\n3. `sourceMap` option is [further normalized](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/normalize-builder-schema.ts#L59)\r\n\r\n4. Normalization of `sourceMap` always ends up with [an object](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/normalize-source-maps.ts#L17-L22)\r\n\r\n5. `source-map-support` is [conditionally included](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/karma.ts#L80-L93), but the condition is always true\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng new foo\r\n$ cd foo\r\n$ npm install karma-jsdom-launcher jsdom\r\n$ sed -i 's/Chrome/jsdom/g' src/karma.conf.js\r\n$ sed -i 's/chrome/jsdom/g' src/karma.conf.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `ng test` and watch the process never exit.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nI was made aware of this issue in https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher/issues/27. Project of said issue aims to allow `jsdom` to be used as a target browser.

Therefore, when I want my Angular 7 app to be bootstrapped by this code, I cannot do this on production, because names of bundles don't match.\r\n\r\nI think of writing kind of post build script that will be done after bundles are created and will simply rename files, but such workaround seems to be slightly risky and I don't know if it's actually feasible solution.\r\n\r\nMy build script:\r\n\"release\": \"ng build --prod --aot --extract-css=false --output-hashing=none --source-map=true\".\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13569","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How to generate bundles with custom names in Angular 7?\" (#13569)"},{"Id":"405710944","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-01T13:53:32","Actor":"surajpoddar16","Number":"13570","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve subsequent build throws error","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: .7.0.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nWhile running ng serve I added a new component in a git branch(lets call it `test`) and changed back to dev branch, the project was rebuilt perfectly, after this every alternate branch change to `test` branch results in build failure.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

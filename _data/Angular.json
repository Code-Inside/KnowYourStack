However, this is the rendered body of `<app-root>`, using either file-based or inline template:\n\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1 </app-root>\n```\n\nOther variants\n\nRemoving `<app-b />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nRemoving `<app-c />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nTrends:\n\n- When removing A or B, C's host element stays but is empty. But when removing C, A and B properly render and there is no C.\n- Not really an issue with non component HTML elements, such as a `<p>stuff</p>` tag in the `<app-root />` template. And the untagged full version I had for my reference was also fine. However, components still are spotty like above when removed and in the same template as primitive elements or text (edited: clarify).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/msmallest/hmr-issue-multiple-components\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nMy reproduction has 3 branches. \n\n- `main` aka CLI generated with a 19.1.1 global\n- `19.1.1` aka I bumped `main` with the actual latest in the `package.json`\n- `nightlies-19.1.1+` that points at all the nightlies (edit: and resolved with `--force`).\n\nMy examples I pasted were from `main`.

I have unit tests for this, which pass.  When I upgrade to Angualr 19, my tests no longer passed.  It seemed to be an issue with how `tick` works, which I see mentioned in [the release notes here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#core-8)\n\n> The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync` and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\nHere is my service:\n```ts\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\nexport class TimerService {\n  private isRunningSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(false);\n  private totalDurationMin = 0;\n  private totalDurationMinutesSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.totalDurationMin);\n  private timerSubscription = new Subscription();\n\n  public totalDurationMinutes$ = this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.asObservable();\n  public isRunning$ = this.isRunningSubject$.asObservable();\n\n  public start(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(true);\n    this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n\n    this.timerSubscription = interval(60 * 1000).subscribe({\n      next: () => {\n        this.totalDurationMin++;\n        this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  public stop(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(false);\n    this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is my unit test which passes in Angular 18, but fails in 19\n\n```ts\nit('should update the observables and start the timer', fakeAsync(() => {\n  //skip initial emit, the start of the timer, and then then next 4 minute ticks\n  service.totalDurationMinutes$.pipe(skip(6)).subscribe({\n    next: (val) => {\n      console.log(`minutes: ${val}`);\n      expect(val).toEqual(5);\n    },\n  });\n\n  service.start();\n  tick(60 * 1000 * 5); //simulate 5 minutes passing\n\n  discardPeriodicTasks();\n}));\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n - [Angular 18](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rbkdn2wp?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n - [Angular 19](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rvqhvurf?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n\nThe unit test fails with `Expected 6 to equal 5.`\n\nYou'll notice that in v18, the console output contains\n```\nminutes: 5\n```\nand in v19 it contains\n```\nminutes: 5\nminutes: 6\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`tick` fires too many times in v19 compared to v18 in unit tests\" (#59577)"},{"Id":"2793884294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T22:07:54","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"59576","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature(compiler): Add Skip Hydration diagnostic.","State":"open","Body":"The diagnostic was created in #49512 but was never added to the list of diagnostic that run.\r\n\r\nfixes #59569\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this PR enables a diagnostic, we'll need a TGP.

The grid has checkboxes and the logic for them is:\n1. When the original data changes - reset all checkboxes to empty array\n2. When filtered data changes (there are filters for the grid - free search, columns, etc...) keep the old checkboxes only if they are still in the filtered data.\n\nWhen I created a linked signal it looked like that:\n```ts\ncheckedItems = linkedSignal<[string[], string[]], string[]>({\n  source: () => [this.data(), this.filteredData()],\n  computation: ([data, filteredData], previous) => {\n    const dataChanged = !previous || data !== previous.source[0]\n\n    if (dataChanged) {\n      return []\n    }\n\n    return previous.value.filter((checkedItem) => filteredData.includes(checkedItem))\n  },\n})\n``` \nIn this case the \"change detection\" is only for `data` but there are cases where you need to identify more changes - especially if you need state in component dependent on multiple inputs (where `ngOnChanges` was used previously).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd either an overload or another function called `linkedSignalWithChanges` which will work this way:\n```ts\ncheckedItems = linkedSignalWithChanges<[string[], string[]], string[]>({\n  source: () => [this.data, this.filteredData],\n  computation: ([, filteredData], [dataChange], previousValue) => {\n    if (dataChange !== undefined) {\n      return []\n    }\n\n    return previousValue.filter((checkedItem) => filteredData.includes(checkedItem))\n  },\n})\n```\nSource will be array of signals (and not a reactive function)\nComputation:\nFirst parameter - source value like now\nSecond parameter - array of changes (same order as source signals array) - can be an array of `SimpleChange`\nThird parameter - previousValue\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep using the more verbose way using current linked signal.\nCreate this as a wrapper function in user code.\nMaybe I am doing something wrong and there is another way to solve those use cases without \"change detecting\" and I will be happy to see how.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59555","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add linkedSignalWithChanges for easier linkedSignal previous to current changes reaction\" (#59555)"},{"Id":"2793491477","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T19:36:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"59574","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): animation sometimes renderer not being destroyed during HMR","State":"closed","Body":"These changes aim to resolve the issue that prompted #59514.

This behavior contradicts the expected asynchronous handling of the CanActivate guard.\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Define a CanActivate guard that checks a user's role via an API call.\n2. The guard is supposed to wait for the API call to complete before allowing navigation.\n3. However, even when the API response is delayed, the navigation proceeds regardless of the response, which causes the guard to behave unpredictably. This issue occurs even when using other mechanisms like resolvers, forkJoin, or additional guards.\n\nExpected Behavior: The CanActivate guard should wait for the API response before allowing or denying navigation. The user should not be navigated to a route until the role check API response is received and processed.\n\nActual Behavior: The CanActivate guard proceeds with navigation without waiting for the API response, which results in incorrect route navigation behavior. This happens even when using techniques such as resolvers, forkJoin, or defining an additional guard that runs before the role guard.\n\nAttempted Fixes:\nTried using a resolver to fetch the API response before navigation, but the guard still executes prematurely.\nUsed forkJoin to await multiple API responses, but the behavior persists.\nCreated a custom guard that executes before the hasRole guard, but it still doesn't wait for asynchronous operations to complete.\n\nSuggested Solution: \nAngular's CanActivate guard should respect asynchronous operations, including API calls, and wait for the response before continuing with the navigation process. It would be helpful if there is a clear mechanism in place to ensure that asynchronous tasks (like API calls for role checks) are fully resolved before the guard executes.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular version: 18.2.6\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59560","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Role Guard Doesn't Wait for API Response Before Allowing Navigation\" (#59560)"},{"Id":"2792856308","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T13:57:42","Actor":"mattjanssen","Number":"59568","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(router): Fix small grammatical errors","State":"open","Body":"Documentation-only update to improve readability.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59568","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(router): Fix small grammatical errors\" (#59568)"},{"Id":"2792795769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T13:32:48","Actor":"jeripeierSBB","Number":"59567","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): support custom elements for RouterLink","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Observe that if you add a character outside of an HTML element, such as below the comment and above the `<p>` aka on line 14, that the styles once again apply after an HMR refresh.\n4.

But one breaking or fixing following the steps doesn't seem to fix the other template's issues.\n\n## Commands run (including args): \n\n`ng serve`\n\n## Packages added\n\nNone beyond Stackblitz starter which was bumped to 19.1.0 for all packages, or a CLI generated app also being bumped from 19.0.6 to 19.1.0 for all packages. Both done manually since I couldn't get the CLI to bump with an `ng update`.\n\n## Reproductions: 2 Stackblitzes and 1 repo\n\nTwo Stackblitzes with the default stackblitz configuration, aka serves with `\"builder\": \"@angular/build:dev-server\",`\n\n[19.0.6 with only style HMR (by default)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-52tivttc?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\n\n[Angular 19.1 with style HMR and template HMR (by default)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-g6mh9zxo?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\n\nRepo that is essentially the 19.1 Stackblitz, but using `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",` as the CLI auto generates to use. Same type of issue occurs.\n\n[19.1-hmr-issue](https://github.com/msmallest/19.1-hmr-issue/blob/main/src/main.ts)\n\n## Related code changes\n\nTo get parity I condensed the CLI app to be structured closer to the Stackblitz starters, meaning taking extra configuration out of `main.ts` and placing the root file and config in there. The builders of the CLI app remain the same since that is what CLI generated apps use.\n\nAs for overall changes from general starting states of apps, this consists of one root component with inline template and inline style properties, and then one component with an external template but internal style property. \n\nPotentially related but ruled out of this reproduction: I wonder if another scenario where there is a component with inline template but exterior style impacts anything, but so much was going on already.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n## Stackblitz\n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.0\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1901.0\n@angular-devkit/core         19.1.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.1.0\n@schematics/angular          19.1.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.7.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n\n## Macbook that ran the CLI generated app\n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.0\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.0\n@schematics/angular             19.1.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nSame issue applies on my Windows 11 in either Stackblitzes or running from a WSL2 Ubuntu local dev server.\n\nAll of this is in Chrome, and I just checked Firefox on the Mac and the same occured.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59558","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HMR will drop styles applied to a component if an HTML element in a component is changed\" (#59558)"},{"Id":"2792130329","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T11:27:54","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"59557","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-browser): roll back HMR fix","State":"closed","Body":"Rolls back the changes from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59514 because they ended up being breaking in 3P.

The best practices and what actually works is unclear right now.\n\nWhen you scaffold a project with --ssr, you get a `server.ts` that even says you can put APIs in there.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work with `ng serve` because `server.ts` isn't used with `ng serve` (it calls your server module directly). To get around this I created a separate api.ts that could be run independently, or from within server.ts. I also created an environments file to switch between the endpoints based on dev mode or production mode.\n\nThis feels hacky but works OK, but then I realized that `ng build` is attempting a prerender WITHOUT my APIs, so it's failing.\n\nWhat's the intended way to use Angular, SSR, and locally hosted APIs?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`ng new test --ssr` (opt out of server routing and app engine apis)\n\nsee server.ts 'Example Express Rest API endpoints can be defined here.' - try doing this.\n\n`ng serve`\nAPIs are missing\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your

I have a setup where source (which is English) language is setup with no additional slug. Meaning that `/` or `/somepage` should get an English version. While other languages, for example German, do have a language slug: `/de`, `/de/somepage`.\n\nI was able to make the new engine work with German language fully and with English - only the home page (`/`). Any other English path (e.g. `/somepage`) results in `AngularNodeAppEngine` not being able to render anything.\n\nMy setup is also different from, what would you probably call, \"default\" in that locale `codes` are with region (e.g. de-DE), but `baseHrefs` are without the region part. This will be visible in `project.json` later.\n\nI will provide an excerpt from `project.json` and full `server.ts` here. If this won't be enough to understand my issue, I can create a reproduction project, but hopefully this will be enough 🙏.\n\n`project.json`:\n```\n\"i18n\": {\n    \"sourceLocale\": {\n      \"code\": \"en-US\",\n      \"baseHref\": \"/\"\n    },\n    \"locales\": {\n      \"de-DE\": {\n        \"translation\": \"src/locale/messages.de-DE.xlf\",\n        \"baseHref\": \"/de/\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n``` \nand `localize` is set to `true` for `build` option.\n\nHere is `server.ts`. It is basically the default one, but I have added two static file middlewares instead of the default one. With the default setup Angular will look for browser files in /de/ folder instead of /de-DE/ where they were actually generated.\n\n```\nimport {\n  AngularNodeAppEngine,\n  createNodeRequestHandler,\n  isMainModule,\n  writeResponseToNodeResponse,\n} from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { dirname, join, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport 'zone.js/node';\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\n\napp.use(\n  '/de',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'de-DE'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.use(\n  '/',\n  express.static(join(browserDistFolder, 'en-US'), {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: false,\n    redirect: false,\n  }),\n);\n\napp.get('/**', (req, res, next) => {\n  angularApp\n    .handle(req)\n    .then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next(),\n    )\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n  const port = process.env['PORT'] || 3000;\n\n  app.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n  });\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n\n```\n\nWhen I run the server with an English path that is not the home page (e.g. `/somepage`), I get the default Node.js \"Cannot Get...\" response, because the \"next()\" function is being triggered in the server meaning that Angular engine did not provide a meaningful response.\n```\n.then(response =>\n      response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next() <--- next is triggered\n    )\n```\n\nI went in to the source code of `AngularAppEngine` (`@angulr/ssr/fesm2022/ssr.mjs`) and I see that the empty response results from `getEntryPointExports` hitting the \n```\nif (!entryPoint) {\n    return undefined;\n}\n```\npart.\n\nI tried printing out the manifest (`this.manifest`) and this is what I get with the before mentioned `project.json` setup:\n```\n{\n  basePath: '/',\n  entryPoints: { '': [Function (anonymous)], de: [Function: de] }\n}\n```\nThe functions when stringified look like this:\n```\nAnonymous function: () => import('./en-US/main.server.mjs')\nNamed function 'de': () => import('./de-DE/main.server.mjs')\n```\n\nThe problem is that the `potentialLocale` parameter which comes from `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` function returns an empty string (which maps to the English bundle) only for the English home page. For other paths it returns whatever the path is. For `/somepage` it returns to \"somepage\" and then the \n```\nconst entryPoint = entryPoints[potentialLocale];\n```\nin `getEntryPointExports` obviously cannot find any matching entryPoint.\n `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` returns empty string `''` only for the home page (`/`).\nIf I change the code to default to the empty string entry point `''` the server works flawlessly, everything gets served as expected.\nThe German version works flawlessly by default because `getPotentialLocaleIdFromUrl` is always able to extract `/de/` from the beginning of the url.\n\nSo my question is - is there something wrong with my setup? I cannot change the setup of having English url with no slug, because we would need to migrate all our english urls in a big project - it's just not doable. How can I accommodate my use case with `AngularAppEngine`? Is this perhaps a bug and could be fixed on your side?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

counterparts.\n\nIt will bring minor but valuable improvements especially for newcomers :\n\n- Reduced file sizes and HTTP requests.\n- Greater control over font properties (e.g., weight, width).\n- Aligns with the latest web standards.\n\nThis change would enhance Angular Material’s efficiency, design capabilities, and relevance.\n\nHere is a quick example of new default font import proposal : \n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin />\n<link\n

This involves retaining references\r\nto instances from prior compilations, which must be done carefully to avoid\r\nmemory leaks.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes such a leak with a complicated retention chain:\r\n\r\n* `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` unnecessarily hangs on to the previous\r\n  `IncrementalDriver` (state of the previous compilation) once the current\r\n  compilation completes.\r\n\r\n  In general this is unnecessary, but should be safe as long as the chain\r\n  only goes back one level - if the `IncrementalDriver` doesn't retain any\r\n  previous `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` instances. However, this does\r\n  happen:\r\n\r\n* `NgCompiler` indirectly causes retention of previous `NgCompiler`\r\n  instances (and thus previous `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` instances)\r\n  through accidental capture of the `this` context in a closure created in\r\n  its constructor. This closure is wrapped in a `ts.ModuleResolutionCache`\r\n  used to create a `ModuleResolver` class, which is passed to the program's\r\n  `TraitCompiler` on construction.\r\n\r\n* The `IncrementalDriver` retains a reference to the `TraitCompiler` of the\r\n  previous compilation, completing the reference chain.\r\n\r\nThe final retention chain thus looks like:\r\n\r\n* `TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` of current program\r\n* `.previous`: `IncrementalDriver` of previous program\r\n* `.lastGood.traitCompiler`: `TraitCompiler`\r\n* `.handlers[..].moduleResolver.moduleResolutionCache`: cache\r\n* (via `getCanonicalFileName` closure): `NgCompiler`\r\n* `.incrementalStrategy`:`TrackedIncrementalBuildStrategy` of previous \r\n  program.\r\n\r\nThe closure link is the \"real\" leak here. `NgCompiler` is creating a closure\r\nfor `getCanonicalFileName`, delegating to its\r\n`this.adapter.getCanonicalFileName`, for the purposes of creating a\r\n`ts.ModuleResolutionCache`. Since this cache appears to be retained in\r\nTypeScript internals, the fact that the closure references `NgCompiler`\r\ncauses previous `NgCompiler` iterations to be retained.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the first two links in the retention chain: the build\r\nstrategy is patched to not retain a `previous` pointer, and the `NgCompiler`\r\nis patched to not create a closure in the first place, but instead pass a\r\nbound function. This ensures that the `NgCompiler` does not retain previous\r\ninstances of itself in the first place, even if the build strategy does\r\nend up retaining the previous incremental state unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe third link (`IncrementalDriver` unnecessarily retaining the whole\r\n`TraitCompiler`) is not addressed in this commit as it's a more\r\narchitectural problem that will require some refactoring. However, the leak\r\npotential of this retention is eliminated thanks to fixing the first two\r\nissues.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(compiler-cli): fix memory leak in retained incremental state\" (#37835)"},{"Id":"647631996","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T21:58:24","Actor":"jbogarthyde","Number":"37833","RawContent":null,"Title":"correct left nav to remove duplicated page links","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\nThe major sections Angular Libraries, Schematics, and CLI Builders appear twice, in their old location under Techniques, and in the new correct location under Extending Angular.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22575#issuecomment-650664473\r\n\r\n> I was thinking if we can extract common validators code into a new `packages/forms/test/util.ts` file (we can store more functions there later). Some validators that are used across many tests (may be you can find more):\r\n> \r\n> * function asyncValidator\r\n> * function asyncValidatorReturningObservable\r\n> * may be `simpleAsyncValidator` added in this test can use some common code from `asyncValidator`\r\n> * I also see a value of moving the `currentStateOf` function (added in this PR) into the `util.ts` file, so we can reuse it for other validators-related tests in other files\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n`master` branch\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37831","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Forms: refactor common validators used in unit tests and extract them to util file\" (#37831)"},{"Id":"647611379","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T19:29:17","Actor":"Exocomp","Number":"37830","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow override of module url","State":"open","Body":"I created a [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62641427/angular-custom-download-url-for-specific-module) but looking through documentation I don't see it possible so created this feature request, if I'm mistaken and this is possible please enlighten me.\r\n\r\nAngular project with the following modules which are lazy loaded (limiting to two modules just for brevity sake but there could be a lot more):\r\n\r\n- UsersModule\r\n- AdminModule\r\n\r\nFor the AdminModule I would like to apply additional security, mainly I would like to IP protect it.

Not sure about the specific ones.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHTML editing is being abused by scammers to deceive gullible victims and extort their money. This usually happens in a fake tech support setting where the scammer first gains remote access to the victim's computer and pull up the victim's online banking website. Then, the scammer tries to distract the victim while at the same time open up the developer console and manually edit the HTML of the banking website to convince the victim that money is added to their account. Finally, the scammer proceeds to claim they added more money than s/he should and demands the victim to return the additional amount by purchasing the scammer gift cards, etc. The scam concludes if the victim falls for it.\r\n\r\nSource: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03fvkJ27eOs (An Internet vigilante records and exposes how such scam works from start to finish.)\r\n\r\nThis is by no means a fringe problem. It is proven that scammers use similar techniques to conduct scam systematically in a career fashion, and millions of dollars per year are scammed out of gullible victims such as the computer illiterate and elderly population.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmvhwwiQAY (BBC documentary on the fake tech support scamming industry)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdding a kind of anti-tamper mechanism would significantly reduce the efficacy of such abuse if not eliminate it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Angular rendering system can listen at a regular interval (or respond to DOM change) and then compute if differentiation occurs at places where it is not supposed to occur. For example, consider the account balance display on a typical banking website, it is expected that such display is implemented using HTML elements such as `<div>, <p> or <span>`.

The expression would still\r\nparse correctly but it doesn't implement the proper semantics, resulting\r\nin incorrect runtime behavior.\r\n\r\nChanging the expression substitution to force a space between the\r\nprimary expression and the assignment avoids this mistake, but it\r\nuncovers a new issue. The grammar does not allow for the LHS of an\r\nassignment to be the non-null operator, so the synthesized expression\r\nwould fail to parse. To alleviate this, the synthesized expression is\r\nparsed with a special parser flag to allow for this syntax.\r\n\r\nFixes #36551\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nImplementation note: it is up for debate whether extending the grammar to accept more expressions as LHS of an assignment would be desirable for regular output bindings. I choose not to change the grammar at this moment, as it seems like a change that needs to be introduced in at least a minor. Additionally, I feel like the whole expression substitution is a bit of a hack in the first place, so an alternative way of handling this case may be desirable in the future. To allow for this cleanup, I feel like it's best to wait for VE removal as the parser infrastructure is currently quite convoluted.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37809","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): allow banana-in-a-box bindings to end with non-null assertion\" (#37809)"},{"Id":"646932188","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-28T14:21:30","Actor":"noorsyyad","Number":"37808","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): change MySixthClass to MyFifthClass","State":"open","Body":"change MySixthClass to MyFifthClass in After migration section as it intend MyFifthClass\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

definition allows the following options for generating souremaps. \r\n```\r\nexport declare type SourceMapUnion = boolean | SourceMapClass;\r\nexport interface SourceMapClass {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Output sourcemaps for all scripts.\r\n     */\r\n    scripts?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Output sourcemaps for all styles.\r\n     */\r\n    styles?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Resolve vendor packages sourcemaps.\r\n     */\r\n    vendor?: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhowever the option for vendor is highly misleading, because setting it to true, actually disables the sourcemaps for all unit tests, See screenshot:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2032760/86006078-c1fec400-ba15-11ea-9ac0-22992e6b5be0.png)\r\n\r\nSince we have a very large application, where the unminified test files are very, very large, this slows down the testing significantly. (the vendor.js has a total of 36MB in its unminified state, 15 without sourcemaps).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA more fine granular solution to control the souremap generation for unit tests would be helpful. I suggest defining  them like this: \r\n```\r\nexport declare type SourceMapUnion = boolean | SourceMapClass;\r\nexport interface SourceMapClass {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Output sourcemaps for all scripts.\r\n     */\r\n    scripts?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Output sourcemaps for all styles.\r\n     */\r\n    styles?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Resolve vendor packages sourcemaps.\r\n     */\r\n    vendor?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Resolve application sourcemaps (main.js and all lazyloaded modules).\r\n     */\r\n    application?: boolean;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Resolve test file sourcemaps.\r\n     */\r\n    test?: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI tried modifying the karma.config.js and tsconfig.spec.ts to control the sourcemap generation, but to no avail\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better control over sourcemap generation for test\" (#18060)"},{"Id":"647240441","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T12:46:20","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18056","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to version","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n:wrench: This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When I started adding one module name I noticed that I need to be very strict with the path, so importing `dayjs/locale/de` is not affected by `dayjs` in `allowedCommonJsDependencies`, so I needed to add every import twice. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAllow globs in `allowedCommonJsDependencies` (e.g. `dayjs/locale/*`) or let it know when adding `dayjs` to `allowedCommonJsDependencies` that `dayjs/locale/de` is related to it.\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n// ...\r\n            \"allowedCommonJsDependencies\": [\r\n              \"dayjs/locale/*\", // option A\r\n              \"dayjs\" // option B\r\n            ],\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to allow ignoring through a comment like eslint rule disabling. I noticed that this would be useful in one case where I add `zone.js/dist/zone-error` in my `environment.ts`. With a comment (e.g. `@ts-ignore-import`) I could ignore the warning here but would still get warnings when someone adds this line accidentally in `environment.prod.ts`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// ...\r\n/*\r\n * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file\r\n * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.\r\n */\r\nimport 'zone.js/dist/zone-error' // @ts-ignore-import\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18058","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow globs in `allowedCommonJsDependencies`\" (#18058)"},{"Id":"646653211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T10:09:01","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18050","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update through2 to version ^4.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [through2](https://togithub.com/rvagg/through2) | devDependencies | major | [`^3.0.0` -> `^4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/through2/3.0.2/4.0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rvagg/through2</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.1`](https://togithub.com/rvagg/through2/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rvagg/through2/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1)\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/rvagg/through2/compare/v3.0.2...v4.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rvagg/through2/compare/v3.0.2...v4.0.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Open the file `/src/app/video/video.component.ts` in the provided Stackblitz link, and observe that the “ready” event is configured to call the showready() method, which should log to the console the message “I am ready” as soon as the youtube player loads (i.e. when the page loads).\r\n2.

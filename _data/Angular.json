At first glance it sounds attractive, we import only something what is needed in that component. But what about global directives?\r\n\r\nFor example, let's imagine directive like `@Directive({ selector: 'form' })` which does something to each form element.\r\n\r\nIn modular architecture this directive is imported to some shared module which will be imported into feature modules.\r\nIn module-less architecture we would need to import it into each standalone component.\r\n\r\nThe main concern here is that it can be easily missed. There won't be any compilation or runtime error and IDE will not highlight it.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend `Directive` decorator with `providedIn` property like in `Injectable`.

Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the \\[ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the *config* of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) – it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.\n-   Changed: \\[unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add `\"unicode-bom\": \"off\"` to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with `--fix` to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM).

So, my guess is where it's checking the error type, to decide whether to absorb the error or re-throw, it needs to consider this error type too (`ENOTDIR`)?\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c34bbb8dad26aca180c2f9f4e1a6ecc5c28dd3c0/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/node-module-engine-host.ts#L69-L73\r\n\r\nSeeing as this code isn't in the test-specific class, I suspect (but haven't verified) this might also fail for the `@angular-devkit/schematics` `externalSchematics` function.\r\n\r\nReproduction Repo: https://github.com/michaelfaith/ng-schematics-yarn-pnp-bug\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @michaelfaith in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16980#issuecomment-1640917890_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug: running \"external\" schematics in yarn pnp workspace\" (#25648)"},{"Id":"1838930974","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-07T09:05:36","Actor":"graphicsxp","Number":"25647","RawContent":null,"Title":"error: Module \"mymodule\" has no exported member \"mycomponent\"  after upgrading to angular 16","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore, Don't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\ni am using an angular workspace with a blend of applications and libraries of my own which are used by these applications.

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.20...v0.19.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.18.0` or `~0.18.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Handle import paths containing wildcards ([#&#8203;56](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/56), [#&#8203;700](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/700), [#&#8203;875](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/875), [#&#8203;976](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/976), [#&#8203;2221](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2221), [#&#8203;2515](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2515))\n\n    This release introduces wildcards in import paths in two places:\n\n    -   **Entry points**\n\n        You can now pass a string containing glob-style wildcards such as `./src/*.ts` as an entry point and esbuild will search the file system for files that match the pattern. This can be used to easily pass esbuild all files with a certain extension on the command line in a cross-platform way. Previously you had to rely on the shell to perform glob expansion, but that is obviously shell-dependent and didn't work at all on Windows. Note that to use this feature on the command line you will have to quote the pattern so it's passed verbatim to esbuild without any expansion by the shell. Here's an example:\n\n        ```sh\n        esbuild --minify \"./src/*.ts\" --outdir=out\n        ```\n\n        Specifically the `*` character will match any character except for the `/` character, and the `/**/` character sequence will match a path separator followed by zero or more path elements. Other wildcard operators found in glob patterns such as `?` and `[...]` are not supported.\n\n    -   **Run-time import paths**\n\n        Import paths that are evaluated at run-time can now be bundled in certain limited situations. The import path expression must be a form of string concatenation and must start with either `./` or `../`. Each non-string expression in the string concatenation chain becomes a wildcard. The `*` wildcard is chosen unless the previous character is a `/`, in which case the `/**/*` character sequence is used. Some examples:\n\n        ```js\n        // These two forms are equivalent\n        const json1 = await import('./data/' + kind + '.json')\n        const json2 = await import(`./data/${kind}.json`)\n        ```\n\n        This feature works with `require(...)` and `import(...)` because these can all accept run-time expressions. It does not work with `import` and `export` statements because these cannot accept run-time expressions. If you want to prevent esbuild from trying to bundle these imports, you should move the string concatenation expression outside of the `require(...)` or `import(...)`. For example:\n\n        ```js\n        // This will be bundled\n        const json1 = await import('./data/' + kind + '.json')\n\n        // This will not be bundled\n        const path = './data/' + kind + '.json'\n        const json2 = await import(path)\n        ```\n\n        Note that using this feature means esbuild will potentially do a lot of file system I/O to find all possible files that might match the pattern. This is by design, and is not a bug. If this is a concern, I recommend either avoiding the `/**/` pattern (e.g. by not putting a `/` before a wildcard) or using this feature only in directory subtrees which do not have many files that don't match the pattern (e.g. making a subdirectory for your JSON files and explicitly including that subdirectory in the pattern).\n\n-   Path aliases in `tsconfig.json` no longer count as packages ([#&#8203;2792](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2792), [#&#8203;3003](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3003), [#&#8203;3160](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3160), [#&#8203;3238](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3238))\n\n    Setting `--packages=external` tells esbuild to make all import paths external when they look like a package path. For example, an import of `./foo/bar` is not a package path and won't be external while an import of `foo/bar` is a package path and will be external. However, the [`paths` field](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) in `tsconfig.json` allows you to create import paths that look like package paths but that do not resolve to packages. People do not want these paths to count as package paths. So with this release, the behavior of `--packages=external` has been changed to happen after the `tsconfig.json` path remapping step.\n\n-   Use the `local-css` loader for `.module.css` files by default ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    With this release the `css` loader is still used for `.css` files except that `.module.css` files now use the `local-css` loader. This is a common convention in the web development community. If you need `.module.css` files to use the `css` loader instead, then you can override this behavior with `--loader:.module.css=css`.\n\n### [`v0.18.20`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01820)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.19...v0.18.20)\n\n-   Support advanced CSS `@import` rules ([#&#8203;953](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/953), [#&#8203;3137](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3137))\n\n    CSS `@import` statements have been extended to allow additional trailing tokens after the import path. These tokens sort of make the imported file behave as if it were wrapped in a `@layer`, `@supports`, and/or `@media` rule. Here are some examples:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css);\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) layer;\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) layer(bar);\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) layer(bar) supports(display: flex);\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) layer(bar) supports(display: flex) print;\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) layer(bar) print;\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) supports(display: flex);\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) supports(display: flex) print;\n    @&#8203;import url(foo.css) print;\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about this advanced syntax [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@&#8203;import). With this release, esbuild will now bundle `@import` rules with these trailing tokens and will wrap the imported files in the corresponding rules. Note that this now means a given imported file can potentially appear in multiple places in the bundle. However, esbuild will still only load it once (e.g. on-load plugins will only run once per file, not once per import).\n\n### [`v0.18.19`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01819)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.18...v0.18.19)\n\n-   Implement `composes` from CSS modules ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release implements the `composes` annotation from the [CSS modules specification](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules#composition). It provides a way for class selectors to reference other class selectors (assuming you are using the `local-css` loader). And with the `from` syntax, this can even work with local names across CSS files. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // app.js\n    import { submit } from './style.css'\n    const div = document.createElement('div')\n    div.className = submit\n    document.body.appendChild(div)\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* style.css */\n    .button {\n      composes: pulse from \"anim.css\";\n      display: inline-block;\n    }\n    .submit {\n      composes: button;\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* anim.css */\n    @&#8203;keyframes pulse {\n      from, to { opacity: 1 }\n      50% { opacity: 0.5 }\n    }\n    .pulse {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Bundling this with esbuild using `--bundle --outdir=dist --loader:.css=local-css` now gives the following:\n\n    ```js\n    (() => {\n      // style.css\n      var submit = \"anim_pulse style_button style_submit\";\n\n      // app.js\n      var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n      div.className = submit;\n      document.body.appendChild(div);\n    })();\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* anim.css */\n    @&#8203;keyframes anim_pulse {\n      from, to {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      50% {\n        opacity: 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n    .anim_pulse {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite anim_pulse;\n    }\n\n    /* style.css */\n    .style_button {\n      display: inline-block;\n    }\n    .style_submit {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Import paths in the `composes: ... from` syntax are resolved using the new `composes-from` import kind, which can be intercepted by plugins during import path resolution when bundling is enabled.\n\n    Note that the order in which composed CSS classes from separate files appear in the bundled output file is deliberately ***undefined*** by design (see [the specification](https://togithub.com/css-modules/css-modules#composing-from-other-files) for details). You are not supposed to declare the same CSS property in two separate class selectors and then compose them together. You are only supposed to compose CSS class selectors that declare non-overlapping CSS properties.\n\n    Issue [#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20) (the issue tracking CSS modules) is esbuild's most-upvoted issue! With this change, I now consider esbuild's implementation of CSS modules to be complete. There are still improvements to make and there may also be bugs with the current implementation, but these can be tracked in separate issues.\n\n-   Fix non-determinism with `tsconfig.json` and symlinks ([#&#8203;3284](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3284))\n\n    This release fixes an issue that could cause esbuild to sometimes emit incorrect build output in cases where a file under the effect of `tsconfig.json` is inconsistently referenced through a symlink. It can happen when using `npm link` to create a symlink within `node_modules` to an unpublished package. The build result was non-deterministic because esbuild runs module resolution in parallel and the result of the `tsconfig.json` lookup depended on whether the import through the symlink or not through the symlink was resolved first. This problem was fixed by moving the `realpath` operation before the `tsconfig.json` lookup.\n\n-   Add a `hash` property to output files ([#&#8203;3084](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3084), [#&#8203;3293](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3293))\n\n    As a convenience, every output file in esbuild's API now includes a `hash` property that is a hash of the `contents` field. This is the hash that's used internally by esbuild to detect changes between builds for esbuild's live-reload feature. You may also use it to detect changes between your own builds if its properties are sufficient for your use case.\n\n    This feature has been added directly to output file objects since it's just a hash of the `contents` field, so it makes conceptual sense to store it in the same location. Another benefit of putting it there instead of including it as a part of the watch mode API is that it can be used without watch mode enabled. You can use it to compare the output of two independent builds that were done at different times.\n\n    The hash algorithm (currently [XXH64](https://xxhash.com/)) is implementation-dependent and may be changed at any time in between esbuild versions. If you don't like esbuild's choice of hash algorithm then you are welcome to hash the contents yourself instead. As with any hash algorithm, note that while two different hashes mean that the contents are different, two equal hashes do not necessarily mean that the contents are equal. You may still want to compare the contents in addition to the hashes to detect with certainty when output files have been changed.\n\n-   Avoid generating duplicate prefixed declarations in CSS ([#&#8203;3292](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3292))\n\n    There was a request for esbuild's CSS prefixer to avoid generating a prefixed declaration if a declaration by that name is already present in the same rule block. So with this release, esbuild will now avoid doing this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    body {\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=safari12) */\n    body {\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=safari12) */\n    body {\n      backdrop-filter: blur(30px);\n      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(45px);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This can result in a visual difference in certain cases (for example if the browser understands `blur(30px)` but not `blur(45px)`, it will be able to fall back to `blur(30px)`). But this change means esbuild now matches the behavior of [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) which is probably a good representation of how people expect this feature to work.\n\n### [`v0.18.18`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01818)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.17...v0.18.18)\n\n-   Fix asset references with the `--line-limit` flag ([#&#8203;3286](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3286))\n\n    The recently-released `--line-limit` flag tells esbuild to terminate long lines after they pass this length limit. This includes automatically wrapping long strings across multiple lines using escaped newline syntax. However, using this could cause esbuild to generate incorrect code for references from generated output files to assets in the bundle (i.e. files loaded with the `file` or `copy` loaders). This is because esbuild implements asset references internally using find-and-replace with a randomly-generated string, but the find operation fails if the string is split by an escaped newline due to line wrapping. This release fixes the problem by not wrapping these strings. This issue affected asset references in both JS and CSS files.\n\n-   Support local names in CSS for `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` ([#&#8203;20](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20))\n\n    This release extends support for local names in CSS files loaded with the `local-css` loader to cover the `@keyframe`, `@counter-style`, and `@container` rules (and also `animation`, `list-style`, and `container` declarations). Here's an example:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes pulse {\n      from, to { opacity: 1 }\n      50% { opacity: 0.5 }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: 🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container squish {\n      li { float: left }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n      list-style: inside moon;\n      container: squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With the `local-css` loader enabled, that CSS will be turned into something like this (with the local name mapping exposed to JS):\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;keyframes stdin_pulse {\n      from, to {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      50% {\n        opacity: 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n    @&#8203;counter-style stdin_moon {\n      system: cyclic;\n      symbols: 🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔;\n    }\n    @&#8203;container stdin_squish {\n      li {\n        float: left;\n      }\n    }\n    ul {\n      animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite stdin_pulse;\n      list-style: inside stdin_moon;\n      container: stdin_squish / size;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use a global name within a file loaded with the `local-css` loader, you can use a `:global` selector to do that:\n\n    ```css\n    div {\n      /* All symbols are global inside this scope (i.e.\n       * \"pulse\", \"moon\", and \"squish\" are global below) */\n      :global {\n        animation: 2s ease-in-out infinite pulse;\n        list-style: inside moon;\n        container: squish / size;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use `@keyframes`, `@counter-style`, or `@container` with a global name, make sure it's in a file that uses the `css` or `global-css` loader instead of the `local-css` loader. For example, you can configure `--loader:.module.css=local-css` so that the `local-css` loader only applies to `*.module.css` files.\n\n-   Support strings as keyframe animation names in CSS ([#&#8203;2555](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now parse animation names that are specified as strings and will convert them to identifiers. The CSS specification allows animation names to be specified using either identifiers or strings but Chrome only understands identifiers, so esbuild will now always convert string names to identifier names for Chrome compatibility:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" {\n      from { opacity: 1 }\n      to { opacity: 0 }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* Old output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes \"hide menu\" { from { opacity: 1 } to { opacity: 0 } }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out \"hide menu\";\n    }\n\n    /* New output */\n    @&#8203;keyframes hide\\ menu {\n      from {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n      to {\n        opacity: 0;\n      }\n    }\n    menu.hide {\n      animation: 0.5s ease-in-out hide\\ menu;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>less/less.js (less)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.2.0`](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v4.1.3...1df9072ee9ebdadc791bf35dfb1dbc3ef9f1948f)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr (ng-packagr)</summary>\n\n### [`v16.2.0`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1620-2023-08-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/16.1.0...16.2.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.64`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/7fef427d2e9bd00dd0a48578d55c908ec32d62b9...5185bfba6189a2fe4ce2b440e492cb45d15f7ecf)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve (resolve)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.22.4`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.3...v1.22.4)\n\n### [`v1.22.3`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.2...v1.22.3)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.65.1`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1651)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.65.0...1.65.1)\n\n-   Update abs-percent deprecatedIn version to `1.65.0`.\n\n### [`v1.65.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1650)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.64.2...1.65.0)\n\n-   All functions defined in CSS Values and Units 4 are now parsed as calculation\n    objects: `round()`, `mod()`, `rem()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `asin()`,\n    `acos()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`, `hypot()`, `log()`, `exp()`,\n    `abs()`, and `sign()`.\n\n-   Deprecate explicitly passing the `%` unit to the global `abs()` function.

The user can select a date/week/month and a more extensive calendar view is opened/updated on the page to for the specific day / week / month. We're using FullCalendar for the extensive calendar view.\r\n- It would be awesome if the MatCalendar could display indicators, for example that a specific date (August 9) has 3 events on this day. Or that the specific date (August 10) has 10 events on this day.\r\n\r\n### Visual example of what could be achieved\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/18558584/65a84681-d663-49cb-8264-81ded789c082)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/18558584/63ef573d-3a82-4a40-a82a-0bf7146bcf93)\r\n\r\n### Reasoning\r\n- Using the dateClass input, I can somewhat achieve a similar thing. I can have an array / map of events, then when rendering the calendar I can match each cell to a list of events, then change the css class accordingly.\r\n  - But the css class is not enough to show dynamic content, such as a text, a specific matTooltip, a specific callback when the cell is hovered, etc.\r\n  - I've seem some hacks floating around that involve replacing the aria-label attribute and then adding a css class that styles the aria-label, but it seems very dirty and non flexible.\r\n- Also, this technique does not \"refresh\" when changing date or if new data is available and should be shown, we have to either:\r\n  - Call `matCalendar.updateTodaysDate()` to force a refresh, even though the date may not really have been changed...\r\n  - Call `matCalendar['_getCurrentViewComponent']()['_init']()` to force a refresh, digging in the code to find private methods that seems to do what we intend to do (refresh each cells based on current dataSet).\r\n\r\n### Feature request\r\n\r\n#### If achievable currently, more documentation\r\n- If what I'm trying to explain is available using renderer and dateClass, I would love to see an example or an explaination of how to do so.\r\n\r\n#### If not achieveable currently\r\n##### Provide data\r\n- The calendar could allow the user to provide, in a way, an array of data or an observable of data associated to specific dates.\r\n- Similar to the dateClass method, a method could be provided to configure how the cell should be rendered depending on the matching provided data.\r\n- Custom components or a very generic component could be configured to map how a specific dataset should behave and be displayed in the context of a cell that has matching data.\r\n  - In my use case, for example, a colored dot that opens an Overlay Panel with details about the hovered day.\r\n\r\n##### Customize each cell view\r\n- The calendar could \"simply\" call a specific method on each cell render, just like the dateClass does.\r\n- The callback could allow us to configure the cell, its hover behavior, tooltip, dom elements that should be displayed under the day number, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nSimple use case, only visual\r\n1. I display the Angular MatCalendar\r\n2. User navigates to December and sees each day of December\r\n3. The 25th is a special day, it has a red dot under the \"25\" to indicate it is a busy day\r\n\r\nSimple use case, different visual\r\n1. I display the Angular MatCalendar\r\n2.

Currently, the available mat-list component has some limitations, particularly when dealing with longer descriptions and on mobile devices. To address these issues and enhance the overall user experience, I propose the development of a new \"Description List\" component for Angular Material.\r\n\r\n## Feature Overview\r\n\r\nThe Description List component will aim to simplify the display of descriptive information, especially when dealing with lengthy content. It will provide the following key features to cater to different screen sizes and use cases:\r\n\r\n- **Unrestricted Height on Mobile**\r\nOn mobile devices, the Description List component will be designed to occupy the available vertical space without any height limitation. This will ensure that users can view all the content without any truncation or text ellipsis, offering a seamless browsing experience on smaller screens.\r\n- **Responsive Design**\r\nThe Description List component will be responsive to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. On mobile devices, it will provide an intuitive and easy-to-read layout, while on desktops or larger screens, it will take advantage of the additional space by displaying terms and descriptions side by side.\r\n- **Flexibility in Content Display**\r\nThe Description List component will allow users to input varying lengths of labels and descriptions. It will dynamically adjust the layout based on the content's length, ensuring that information is presented in a visually appealing manner while maintaining readability.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nIntroducing the Description List component will offer several benefits to developers and end-users:\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced User Experience**\r\nBy providing an improved and responsive display for lengthy descriptive information, users can easily comprehend product characteristics and other details without any truncation or clutter.\r\n- **Consistency with Angular Material**\r\nThe new component will seamlessly integrate into the existing Angular Material ecosystem, maintaining the consistent and professional look and feel users have come to expect.\r\n- **Reduced Development Efforts**\r\nDevelopers will save time and effort by utilizing this out-of-the-box component for displaying detailed information, rather than resorting to custom solutions or third-party libraries.\r\n- **Mobile-Friendly**\r\nWith unrestricted height on mobile devices, the Description List component will cater to an increasing number of users accessing applications on their smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Ideas\r\n\r\nThe Description List component can be implemented by creating a new Angular Material module that includes the necessary CSS styles and layout logic or use the current `MatListModule`. It can leverage Angular's flexbox and grid systems to achieve the responsive layout and dynamic adjustments based on the content's length.\r\n\r\n#### Code Example (Potential Usage):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Component only -->\r\n<mat-description-list>\r\n  <mat-description-term>Product Name:</mat-description-term>\r\n  <mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</mat-description-details>\r\n\r\n  <mat-description-term>Product Code:</mat-description-term>\r\n  <mat-description-details>ABC123</mat-description-details>\r\n</mat-description-list>\r\n\r\n<!-- with actual <dl> <dt> and <dd> -->\r\n<dl mat-description-list>\r\n  <dt mat-description-term>Product Name:</dt>\r\n  <dd mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt mat-description-term>Product Code:</dt>\r\n  <dd mat-description-details>ABC123</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<!-- with wrapping div that could help for styling -->\r\n<dl mat-description-list>\r\n  <div mat-description-list-item>\r\n    <dt mat-description-term>Product Name:</dt>\r\n    <dd mat-description-details>Super Amazing Product</dd>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div mat-description-list-item>\r\n    <dt mat-description-term>Product Code:</dt>\r\n    <dd mat-description-details>ABC123</dd>\r\n  </div>\r\n</dl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Description List component to Angular Material will significantly improve the display of descriptive information, particularly in scenarios with lengthy product characteristics or similar content. The component's responsiveness and flexibility will ensure an optimal user experience across different devices, making it a valuable addition to the Angular Material library.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature request. I believe that this enhancement will greatly benefit the Angular Material community and contribute to a more robust and user-friendly UI framework. I look forward to seeing this feature become a reality :).

It is pretty common to change this input's value internally e.g. when the user clicks on the accordion header. Using the old decorator version this would result in much less code, since the input's value can simply be changed.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  @Input()\r\n  isExpandedOld = false;\r\n\r\n  toggleExpandedOld() {\r\n    this.isExpandedOld = !this.isExpandedOld;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow switching to signal inputs there is the need for an extra `effect` as well as a extra `signal`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  isExpanded = input(true);\r\n  isExpandedManual = signal(false);\r\n\r\n  toggleExpanded() {\r\n    this.isExpandedManual.set(!this.isExpandedManual());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    effect(\r\n      () => {\r\n        this.isExpandedManual.set(this.isExpanded());\r\n      },\r\n      { allowSignalWrites: true },\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nKeep the old behavior of being able to change the inputs value from within the component. This would also make the migration to signal inputs easier, once they are out of developer preview.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53982","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Not being able to change a signal input from within the component results in more

Is there a parameter to configure the GLOBAL heap used by NodeJS process for building phase ? If not, I think it could be useful to have one, and/or be able to fine-tune memory for all V8 isolates with high memory consumption\r\n\r\n- I cannot find any documentation explaning the fact that \"production > optimization > scripts\" option can result in high memory consumption, why it takes such memory, how I could tune it. Is is possible to have such a documentation / explanation ?\r\n\r\n- I also found this issue about memory limits for several \"V8 isolates\" in NodeJS, and was wondering whether it could be linked to my issue : https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43991\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNote : I was also facing same issue with Angular 14 : \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26553\r\n\n\n###

Description\n\nI'm encountering an issue with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/). Despite the package appearing to load successfully, the terminal outputs the following error message every time the server reloads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load url /~partytown/partytown.js (resolved id: /~partytown/partytown.js). Does the file exist?\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant setup in my `angular.json`:\r\n```JSON\r\n  \"assets\": [\r\n    \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n    \"src/assets\",\r\n    {\r\n      \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n      \"input\": \"node_modules/@builder.io/partytown/lib\",\r\n      \"output\": \"/~partytown\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe peculiar aspect is that the package seems to load correctly. Console messages confirm the package's presence and activity. This discrepancy between the terminal error and the actual functionality is puzzling. I'm curious if this is a known issue or a misconfiguration on my end. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nTo reproduce:\r\n- create a new project with the latest version of angular\r\n   - Setup SSR (`ng add @angular/ssr`)\r\n- Install and setup partytown\r\n- run `ng serve`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nFailed to load url /~partytown/partytown.js (resolved id: /~partytown/partytown.js).

I did not expect.\r\n\r\nI have a package in node_module that exports an enum like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n(function (MyEnum) {\r\n    MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"c\";\r\n})(MyEnum || (exports.MyEnum = MyEnum = {}));\r\n```\r\nI use it in my code like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {MyEnum} from '@my-package';\r\n\r\nconst MyEnumTitlesMap = new Map<MyEnum, string>([\r\n  [MyEnum.A, 'title for A'],\r\n  [MyEnum.B, 'title for B'],\r\n  [MyEnum.C, 'title for C'],\r\n]);\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n  ...\r\n  myMethod() {\r\n    const title = MyEnumTitlesMap.get(MyEnum.A)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTypescript recognizes the enum `MyEnum` but at runtime `MyEnum` is undefined. \r\n\r\nWhen I look a the generated bundle using @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser  as builder,  with `buildOptimized: true` the genrated bundle has \r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyEnum = /*#__PURE__*/(() => {\r\n  MyEnum = MyEnum || {};\r\n  MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"d\";\r\n  return MyEnum;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nMyEnum is no longer exported, that's why at runtime it's undefined.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nI have spent 4 days trying to reproduce in a simple project but I couldn't.\r\nWhat I have is a commonJs package on npm registry which I install using yarn on my angular 16 project, the packag exports an enum which I can only use if It's inside the component for example a public property of the component and not in a const outside the component, in which case it gets tree shaken.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the enum, and it wouldn't be tree-shaken.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have been unable to reproduce myself.\n\n###

Among others, this library includes custom components which are to be opened inside a dialog. Here is what the module of such a component looks like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [MyComponent],\r\n  imports: [MatDialogModule],\r\n  export: [MyComponent],\r\n})\r\nexport class MyModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor applications which use that component in an NgModule, this works fine. However one of the applications is in the progress of migrating to standalone. After making the component standalone and adding `MyModule` to the `imports`, the unit tests involving the `MatDialog` service opening `MyComponent` failed. After investigation, I found out that the instance injected by the component constructor and the instance injected by `TestBed.inject()` are now two separate ones.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed with the Angular core team that this is by design, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53929.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `MatDialogModule` has `MatDialog` in its `providers`: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/b8cf1308571b29622422cd56f7f76b7bbc5ba5b1/src/material/dialog/module.ts#L34\r\n\r\nIMHO it should be removed from the providers, as the service is `providedIn: 'root'`.\r\n\r\nThe `MatSnackBar` has the same issue, there might be more affected services in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/json-derulo/ng17-dialog-issue\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run `ng test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere is only one instance of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro pass\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere are multiple instances of `MatDialog` and the test case in the repro fails\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.10\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.9\r\n...

Attribute - no change watching but no binding too. Limited to only compile time strings.\r\n2. Input - signal based and can change over time.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing is the in between. A way to pass an input but without change watching.\r\n\r\nThe idea came from inputs I can't or don't want to handle when they change. Currently using ngOnChanges first change check I throw an error if it gets changed after first time.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA way to declare on time input. Something like:\r\n`a = input.oneTime<string>()` and will be just a string. If changed after first time will throw an error.\r\nIt will also make performance better (I think?) as no need for signal or tracking.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCheck in ngOnChanges for first change and throw error.

This can cause code to be migrated incorrectly and doesn't handle cases like import aliases. I've switched it to use the existing tooling for detecting decorated classes.\r\n* The migration was trying to migrate directives, even though they don't support the `imports` field.\r\n* The migration was detecting `TestBed.configureTestingModule` calls using a raw string match which is very fragile and can be broken by the user's formatting.\r\n* There were syntax errors in the unit tests.\r\n* There were type checking errors in the unit tests, for example none of them were importing the Angular decorators that they were migrating.\r\n\r\nThere's more room for improvement, but this should resolve the most glaring issues without having to rewrite too much.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(migrations): resolve multiple structural issues with HttpClient migration\" (#55557)"},{"Id":"2265782293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-26T13:26:42","Actor":"rosostolato","Number":"55560","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone Component Exports","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow standalone components to export other components to be accessed from within.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app-tab-group',\r\n  exports: [TabComponent], // export `app-tab` to be accessed as a child of `app-tab-group`\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\nexport class TabGroupComponent { }\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: 'app-my-component',\r\n  imports: [TabGroupComponent], // only import TabGroup and TabComponent will come along\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-tab-group>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 1</app-tab>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 2</app-tab>\r\n      <app-tab>Tab 3</app-tab>\r\n    </app-tab-group>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, `TabGroupComponent` would act as a module and you won't need to import `TabComponent` every time you want to use them.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to create a module and export both components, but you will still be chained to ng modules.

on project reference update","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo setup using npm workspaces, with `/app` containing the Angular application and `/common` containing some common classes, interfaces etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Angular app, in the `tsconfig` I have common set up as a project reference, and this is then made accessible within my angular code by a typical module reference (`@myorg/common`).\r\n\r\nWhen serving my app, I have typescript set up to watch any changes in the `/common` folder and rebuild, and before switching to the new Vite-based dev server this all worked fine: when doing an `ng serve`, then modifying a class in common, the app would be reloaded with the latest code.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the new server, because Vite caches node modules in `.angular/cache/v17.2.0/vite/deps`, and only refreshes it on package-lock changes, its caching my symlinked common module, and then ignoring any changes I make. Not only does this mean is not live reloading, but on subsequent runs, unless I modify the package lock or remove the cache, it will use a stale version of my common module.\r\n\r\nIn a pure Vite scenario, this would be resolved by adding a `vite.config.ts` file like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default {\r\n  optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@myorg/common'] }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've read several threads where modifying the Vite config doesn't seem to be possible or on the roadmap for the dev server, so I'm not sure how else I'm supposed to resolve this without disabling the cache entirely through `angular.json`, which removes a lot of the performance benefits. Appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create top-level npm workspace `package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"repro\",\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"app\",\r\n    \"common\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. `mkdir app && mkdir common`\r\n3. Create a basic typescript library in `common` with a `package.json` and a basic class\r\n4. `cd app && ng new`\r\n5. Modify tsconfig to have project reference to common:\r\n```json\r\n\"references\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"../common\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n6. Import the library class in the app component and use it\r\n7. Within `/common`, run `tsc -w` in one shell and keep running\r\n8. Within `/app`, run `ng serve`\r\n9. Modify the class in `common`. tsc will rebuild but angular dev server will not reload\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.0\r\nNode: 20.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.1\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                    17.2.0\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@angular/google-maps            17.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27552","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite dev server with npm workspaces not reloading on project reference update\" (#27552)"},{"Id":"2266844538","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-27T05:10:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27551","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ba1c7fd` -> `67a0eef` |\n| [@angular/bazel](https://togithub.com/angular/bazel-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `62b2173` -> `37e0181` |\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `44162cc` -> `f3f429c` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `42ff402` -> `5f68f8d` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `366fecf` -> `e2009e0` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `de31ef5` -> `16be857` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `3e3f974` -> `76f516a` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `1a89fdc` -> `fa40a33` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `baa47ac` -> `5dab7a6` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `246c24c` -> `a7de908` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d8a60fa` -> `4e7b1ef` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c8a7ef9` -> `80fa4f7` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4e852f6` -> `129e034` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `da08acd` -> `aa46159` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b062feb` -> `a681480` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `99a5149` -> `06a5712` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b3ab491` -> `5e6bf22` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c82d952` -> `df00fc4` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2248667` -> `b8a86a5` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `f82e2c4` -> `56d0b1f` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I would like to have an option `infiniteScroll` or another, with a better name, which when set, would emit the next page or previous page events until the data-source returns an empty set, thus letting the user know that they have reached the end of the dataset. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThe total count of a table is normally found by counting all rows in relational dbs like PostgreSQL\r\n \r\n> [However both both forms of count(1) and count(*) are fundamentally slow. PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure consistency between simultaneous transactions. This means each transaction may see different rows -- and different numbers of rows -- in a table. There is no single universal row count that the database could cache, so it must scan through all rows counting how many are visible. Performance for an exact count grows linearly with table size.](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/12/count-performance/#dup_counts_exact)\r\n\r\nMoreover, the resulting count is even slower when filters are applied. Filters are the expected part of any data table. \r\n\r\nWith an infinite scroll option, the user can keep firing the next page event without having to bog down the db with an expensive count query at the start.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28978","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(paginator): Paginator option where total length of the dataset of unknown\" (#28978)"},{"Id":"2267411417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T17:57:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28975","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): export all available M3 palettes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `$spring-green-palette` wasn't being exported.\r\n\r\nFixes #28924.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28975","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): export all available M3 palettes\" (#28975)"},{"Id":"2268890081","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T12:17:49","Actor":"monacodelisa","Number":"28977","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(slide-toggle): Customized slide toggle for theming featuring light / dark mode icon","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nThe feature I am suggesting is to add and additional slide-toggle button option\r\nthat is already customized for theme switching control.\r\n\r\n- having integrated theme appropriate icons within the `mdc-switch__icons` \r\n- to replace the two `SVG`s that are currently within \r\n\r\nI implemented it in one of my projects using vanilla JS and thought that it might be nice to have it as and option available\r\n- as a ready component within Angular Material Examples page.\r\n\r\nhere is a screenshot from my implementation:\r\n\r\nLight Mode\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/64324417/e4e20c29-a450-4d44-b2b4-3e831bb94abe)\r\n\r\nDark Mode \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/64324417/0f37ecd0-8846-44ba-9c97-49b6669ec16a)\r\n\r\nI have now implemented it on a second site too \r\n- [view live](https://monacodelisa.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nThe `slide-toggle` component is often used as theme switcher, \r\nso I think that it would be very nice to have it ready and available. \r\n\r\nThe new design makes it easy to implement.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28977","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(slide-toggle): Customized slide toggle for theming featuring light / dark mode icon\" (#28977)"},{"Id":"2268333083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T07:35:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28976","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preview popover fixes","State":"open","Body":"Includes the following fixes related the preview popovers:\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/drag-drop): reset user agent color on preview popover\r\nAfter #28945 the preview is inserted into a `popover` element which has a user agent styling of `color: canvastext`.

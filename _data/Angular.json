For example:\n\n```\nreadonly myElement = viewChild<HTMLInputElement>('someSelector');\n```\n\nHere I am passing a generic argument, HTMLInputElement, but the element may have a different type. Often I forget to wrap the element within an `ElementRef`, as I did here, but I digress. The point is, I often waste time being unsure of what is actually being injected by Angular in the component class.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI believe that the easiest solution would be to include some kind of validator function:\n```\nreadonly myElement = viewChild('someSelector', { validator: e => e instanceof HTMLInputElement });\n```\n\nType signature would be as follows:\n\n```\n<T>(selector: string, options: { validator: (el: unknown) => el is T }) : Signal<T>;\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n**Alternative 1:**\n\nThe current API is not as ergonomic as it could be. Why can't the Angular Language service ensure that `myElement` is of the correct type:\n```\nreadonly myElement: HTMLElement;\n```\n... and in the template:\n```\n<input #myElement />    <!-- throw error here (if not of type HTMLElement) -->\n```\n\n**Alternative 2:**\n\nI thought about creating an external utility function that wraps the existing functionality but does an additional type check when the signal is invoked. I was unsuccessful. Perhaps you could tell me how to facilitate this.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide better type safety for viewChild (and viewChildren)\" (#59717)"},{"Id":"2811162279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T20:28:09","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59716","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): check whether application is destroyed before printing hydration stats","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we check whether the application is destroyed before printing hydration stats.

The \"poller\" would then know when it is going to fetch the next value (even on the same request).\n\nExample 2: Retry\n\nImagine some streaming resource implementation which automatically retries after an error occured. It will then know when it is \"Reloading\".\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend the type of the signal with\n\n```ts\n{ value: T }\n| { error: unknown }\n| { status: ResourceStatus.Loading | ResourceStatus.Reloading }\n```\nWhen the signal of the streaming resource emits a \"status\" the `Resource<T>` transitions to the given state (I don't think the other `ResourceStatus` values make sense here).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently the implementation would have to encode the (re)loading information into its value and that can't be populated to the `Resource<T>`'s status.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59712","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"extend streaming resource with {status} capability\" (#59712)"},{"Id":"2810880612","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T09:19:47","Actor":"json-derulo","Number":"59711","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): use custom data attribute as identifyer for test components","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Use the provided component code in an Angular 19 standalone project.\n2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.\n3.

If this is intended to be left as-is, you can use the /* @vite-ignore */ comment inside the import() call to suppress this warning.\n\n  Plugin: vite:import-analysis\n  File: /Users/user/angular-19/.angular/vite-root/angular-19/main.js\n```\n\nIt seems that you could get rid of this warning by adding the comment like it says. But of course, it's not possible to add it since it's internal Angular thing. Turns out that the comment is there already but having tsconfig to remove the comments when compiling, broke this system.\n\nWould it be possible\n- Document this some where in update guide that you probably do not want to have `removeComments` on?\n- Add it to the HRM warning message shown on start, that if removeComments is on, you should probably turn it off?\n- Isn't there any more robust system to turn that analysis off that Angular could use? Relying on comments seems really easy to break. I get that it's just a warning and doesn't really break anything. But it's little bit scary that you got 100 of these warnings after upgrade. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nYou can reproduce this by creating new Angular project and adding `\"removeComments\": true` to `tsconfig.json`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.4\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.4\n@angular/cli                    19.1.4\n@schematics/angular             19.1.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29470","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bunch of warnings: \"The above dynamic import cannot be analyzed by Vite.\"\" (#29470)"},{"Id":"2809116675","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T12:20:56","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29474","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): disable TypeScript `removeComments` option","State":"closed","Body":"Disables TypeScript's `removeComments` option to ensure important annotations like `/* @__PURE__ */` and `/* vite-ignore */` are preserved.

I have included a demo project that has two components - an Index component and a TodoDetail component. A simple CSS styling is included in the index.component.css file. The TodoDetail component makes a HTTP request to an external API using HttpClient service. While on the TodoDetail page, refresh the browser and clear browser cache, then return back to index page by clicking on the back button on the browser, depending whether you have `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` enabled or not, your dev node js SSR server should either crash or show HttpErrorResponse containing 404 Not Found error.\n\nA demo project is uploaded to github [Acme Todo](https://github.com/rabikr/acme)\n\n## To reproduce the error\n1. Run the local dev server by running the command `ng serve`.\n2. Open Chrome, navigate to home page.\n3. Open Chrome dev tool, go to network tab, select `Disable cache`.\n4. On the home page, click any one of the link.\n5. Refresh the page while on the todo detail view page. This is clear the cache.\n6. Return back to the previous page using the back button.\n7. Check server node js logs, it shows the dev server is trying to fetch .component.css.map file from the API server instead of Angular dev server.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/rabikr/acme\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR HttpErrorResponse {\n  headers: _HttpHeaders {\n    headers: Map(25) {\n      'access-control-allow-credentials' => [Array],\n      'age' => [Array],\n      'alt-svc' => [Array],\n      'cache-control' => [Array],\n      'cf-cache-status' => [Array],\n      'cf-ray' => [Array],\n      'connection' => [Array],\n      'content-length' => [Array],\n      'content-type' => [Array],\n      'date' => [Array],\n      'etag' => [Array],\n      'expires' => [Array],\n      'nel' => [Array],\n      'pragma' => [Array],\n      'report-to' => [Array],\n      'reporting-endpoints' => [Array],\n      'server' => [Array],\n      'server-timing' => [Array],\n      'vary' => [Array],\n      'via' => [Array],\n      'x-content-type-options' => [Array],\n      'x-powered-by' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-limit' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-remaining' => [Array],\n      'x-ratelimit-reset' => [Array]\n    },\n    normalizedNames: Map(25) {\n      'access-control-allow-credentials' => 'access-control-allow-credentials',\n      'age' => 'age',\n      'alt-svc' => 'alt-svc',\n      'cache-control' => 'cache-control',\n      'cf-cache-status' => 'cf-cache-status',\n      'cf-ray' => 'cf-ray',\n      'connection' => 'connection',\n      'content-length' => 'content-length',\n      'content-type' => 'content-type',\n      'date' => 'date',\n      'etag' => 'etag',\n      'expires' => 'expires',\n      'nel' => 'nel',\n      'pragma' => 'pragma',\n      'report-to' => 'report-to',\n      'reporting-endpoints' => 'reporting-endpoints',\n      'server' => 'server',\n      'server-timing' => 'server-timing',\n      'vary' => 'vary',\n      'via' => 'via',\n      'x-content-type-options' => 'x-content-type-options',\n      'x-powered-by' => 'x-powered-by',\n      'x-ratelimit-limit' => 'x-ratelimit-limit',\n      'x-ratelimit-remaining' => 'x-ratelimit-remaining',\n      'x-ratelimit-reset' => 'x-ratelimit-reset'\n    },\n    lazyInit: undefined,\n    lazyUpdate: null\n  },\n  status: 404,\n  statusText: 'Not Found',\n  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/index.component.css.map',\n  ok: false,\n  type: undefined,\n  name: 'HttpErrorResponse',\n  message: 'Http failure response for https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/index.component.css.map: 404 Not Found',\n  error: {}\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.4\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.4\n@angular/cli                    19.1.4\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.4\n@schematics/angular             19.1.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29475","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components sourcemap not resolved when using sub-paths\" (#29475)"},{"Id":"2807982165","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-23T23:48:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29466","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): support Vite `allowedHosts` option for development server","State":"closed","Body":"Vite version 6.0.9+, which is now used by the Angular CLI, contains a potentially breaking change for some development setups.

disable typeahead in CdkMenu","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWe would like to add an option in the `CdkMenu` to disable the integrated TypeAhead feature.\n\nCurrently, the menu activates the TypeAhead for its `FocusKeyManager` automatically:\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e91d5091bbf3d44cc168be458269d260a0c22c27/src/cdk/menu/menu-base.ts#L175\n\nThe proposal would be to add an input like `cdkMenuTypeAhead: boolean` which defaults to true but can be used to skip the TypeAhead activation:\n```ts\nthis.keyManager = new FocusKeyManager(this.items).withWrap().withHomeAndEnd();\nif (this.cdkMenuTypeAhead) {\n  this.keyManager = this.keyManager.withTypeAhead()\n}\n```\n\n#### Alternative\n\nAn alternative approach might be a combination of the following features, so the described use case can be accomplished by the `CdkMenu` itself.\n1. Make the current search term (`_pressedLetters`) publicly available, so it can be displayed.\n2. Two variants to extend the current search logic:  \n  2.a Add a secondary `includes` search to the current `startsWith`.\n  2.b Make the search logic customizable with configurable predicate function.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThe use case is a custom search feature for our menus, which conflicts with the integrated TypeAhead.\nWe want to display the current search term and search by `startsWith` & `includes`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a9823aa-e645-4c02-98c8-71e8361e8178) ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be067fd8-0133-498d-a702-b3534632be16)\n\n***\n\n**🗨 I would appreciate some feedback, if this feature has a chance of being accepted.

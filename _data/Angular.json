HostAttributeToken more modern like new input/output","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile I was working with the new inputs & outputs, I have encountered a small inconsistency when defining input and Host Attribute Token.\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\n`label = inject(new HostAttributeToken('label'));`\r\n`options = input<any[]>();`\r\n\r\nHostAttributeToken is kind OOP way and the input is more functional way.\r\n\r\nWhy not make it consistent and use functional way for both input and HostAttributeToken?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nGiven the function declaration for the inject and HostAttributeToken, I have come up with this solution.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function hostAttributeToken(attributeName: string, optional?: boolean): string | null {\r\n  if (optional === true) {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName), { optional }) as string | null;\r\n  }\r\n  else if (optional === false) {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName), { optional }) as string;\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    return inject(new HostAttributeToken(attributeName)) as string;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing it will be more natural in my opinion.\r\n`label = hostAttributeToken('label');`\r\n\r\nThis is the type definition.\r\n```\r\n**\r\n * @param token A token that represents a static attribute on the host node that should be injected.\r\n * @returns Value of the attribute if it exists.\r\n * @throws If called outside of a supported context or the attribute does not exist.\r\n *\r\n * @publicApi\r\n */\r\nexport declare function inject(token: HostAttributeToken): string;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @param token A token that represents a static attribute on the host node that should be injected.\r\n * @returns Value of the attribute if it exists, otherwise `null`.\r\n * @throws If called outside of a supported context.\r\n *\r\n * @publicApi\r\n */\r\nexport declare function inject(token: HostAttributeToken, options: {\r\n    optional: true;\r\n}): string | null;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @param token A token that represents a static attribute on the host node that should be injected.\r\n * @returns Value of the attribute if it exists.\r\n *

After that, we navigate to *\"a-component\"*, as result, `AComponent` get an instance of `MyService` from `\"Route: b-component\"` child injector. \r\n\r\nWhen I met this behavior, I was a bit confused, since I thought, only `BComponent` can have access to the child injector. \r\n\r\nWe can observe the same thing with lazy-loading module injectors.\r\n\r\nI assume, this situation is happening because of [this pull request](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54265). Could you explain to me if this is intentional behavior? In my opinion, it may lead to unexpected bugs.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Omit packages from bundles by default when targeting node ([#&#8203;1874](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1874), [#&#8203;2830](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2830), [#&#8203;2846](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2846), [#&#8203;2915](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2915), [#&#8203;3145](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3145), [#&#8203;3294](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3294), [#&#8203;3323](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3323), [#&#8203;3582](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3582), [#&#8203;3809](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3809), [#&#8203;3815](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3815))\n\n    This breaking change is an experiment. People are commonly confused when using esbuild to bundle code for node (i.e. for `--platform=node`) because some packages may not be intended for bundlers, and may use node-specific features that don't work with a bundler. Even though esbuild's \"getting started\" instructions say to use `--packages=external` to work around this problem, many people don't read the documentation and don't do this, and are then confused when it doesn't work. So arguably this is a bad default behavior for esbuild to have if people keep tripping over this.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now omit packages from the bundle by default when the platform is `node` (i.e. the previous behavior of `--packages=external` is now the default in this case). *Note that your dependencies must now be present on the file system when your bundle is run.* If you don't want this behavior, you can do `--packages=bundle` to allow packages to be included in the bundle (i.e. the previous default behavior). Note that `--packages=bundle` doesn't mean all packages are bundled, just that packages are allowed to be bundled. You can still exclude individual packages from the bundle using `--external:` even when `--packages=bundle` is present.\n\n    The `--packages=` setting considers all import paths that \"look like\" package imports in the original source code to be package imports. Specifically import paths that don't start with a path segment of `/` or `.` or `..` are considered to be package imports. The only two exceptions to this rule are [subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) (which start with a `#` character) and TypeScript path remappings via `paths` and/or `baseUrl` in `tsconfig.json` (which are applied first).\n\n-   Drop support for older platforms ([#&#8203;3802](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3802))\n\n    This release drops support for the following operating systems:\n\n    -   Windows 7\n    -   Windows 8\n    -   Windows Server 2008\n    -   Windows Server 2012\n\n    This is because the Go programming language dropped support for these operating system versions in [Go 1.21](https://go.dev/doc/go1.21#windows), and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.20 to Go 1.22.\n\n    Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the `esbuild` npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.21). That might look something like this:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\n        cd esbuild\n        go build ./cmd/esbuild\n        ./esbuild.exe --version\n\n    In addition, this release increases the minimum required node version for esbuild's JavaScript API from node 12 to node 18. Node 18 is the oldest version of node that is still being supported (see node's [release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) for more information). This increase is because of an incompatibility between the JavaScript that the Go compiler generates for the `esbuild-wasm` package and versions of node before node 17.4 (specifically the `crypto.getRandomValues` function).\n\n-   Update `await using` behavior to match TypeScript\n\n    TypeScript 5.5 subtly changes the way `await using` behaves. This release updates esbuild to match these changes in TypeScript. You can read more about these changes in [microsoft/TypeScript#58624](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58624).\n\n-   Allow `es2024` as a target environment\n\n    The ECMAScript 2024 specification was just approved, so it has been added to esbuild as a possible compilation target. You can read more about the features that it adds here: <https://2ality.com/2024/06/ecmascript-2024.html>. The only addition that's relevant for esbuild is the regular expression `/v` flag. With `--target=es2024`, regular expressions that use the `/v` flag will now be passed through untransformed instead of being transformed into a call to `new RegExp`.\n\n-   Publish binaries for OpenBSD on 64-bit ARM ([#&#8203;3665](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3665), [#&#8203;3674](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3674))\n\n    With this release, you should now be able to install the `esbuild` npm package in OpenBSD on 64-bit ARM, such as on an Apple device with an M1 chip.\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;ikmckenz](https://togithub.com/ikmckenz).\n\n-   Publish binaries for WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) preview 1 ([#&#8203;3300](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3300), [#&#8203;3779](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3779))\n\n    The upcoming WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) standard is going to be a way to run WebAssembly outside of a JavaScript host environment. In this scenario you only need a `.wasm` file without any supporting JavaScript code. Instead of JavaScript providing the APIs for the host environment, the WASI standard specifies a \"system interface\" that WebAssembly code can access directly (e.g. for file system access).\n\n    Development versions of the WASI specification are being released using preview numbers. The people behind WASI are currently working on preview 2 but the Go compiler has [released support for preview 1](https://go.dev/blog/wasi), which from what I understand is now considered an unsupported legacy release. However, some people have requested that esbuild publish binary executables that support WASI preview 1 so they can experiment with them.\n\n    This release publishes esbuild precompiled for WASI preview 1 to the `@esbuild/wasi-preview1` package on npm (specifically the file `@esbuild/wasi-preview1/esbuild.wasm`). This binary executable has not been tested and won't be officially supported, as it's for an old preview release of a specification that has since moved in another direction. If it works for you, great! If not, then you'll likely have to wait for the ecosystem to evolve before using esbuild with WASI. For example, it sounds like perhaps WASI preview 1 doesn't include support for opening network sockets so esbuild's local development server is unlikely to work with WASI preview 1.\n\n-   Warn about `onResolve` plugins not setting a path ([#&#8203;3790](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3790))\n\n    Plugins that return values from `onResolve` without resolving the path (i.e. without setting either `path` or `external: true`) will now cause a warning. This is because esbuild only uses return values from `onResolve` if it successfully resolves the path, and it's not good for invalid input to be silently ignored.\n\n-   Add a new Go API for running the CLI with plugins ([#&#8203;3539](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3539))\n\n    With esbuild's Go API, you can now call `cli.RunWithPlugins(args, plugins)` to pass an array of esbuild plugins to be used during the build process. This allows you to create a CLI that behaves similarly to esbuild's CLI but with additional Go plugins enabled.\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;edewit](https://togithub.com/edewit).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>istanbuljs/istanbuljs (istanbul-lib-instrument)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.3`](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/HEAD/packages/istanbul-lib-instrument/CHANGELOG.md#603-2024-06-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/compare/istanbul-lib-instrument-v6.0.2...istanbul-lib-instrument-v6.0.3)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   allow use of importAttributes Babel parser plugin ([#&#8203;786](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/issues/786)) ([a44a124](https://togithub.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/commit/a44a124a600a798165f157d643f1fdb095c74f95))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss (postcss)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.39`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#8439)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.38...8.4.39)\n\n-   Fixed `CssSyntaxError` types (by [@&#8203;romainmenke](https://togithub.com/romainmenke)).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It is the preferred option for new projects and we think migrating to it is a good idea. But we have found a small issue with how the static assets are served compared to the previous `browser` builder.\r\n\r\nOur application requires a bunch of static files to work, and one of the html files is accessed using the parent folder name without a trailing slash: `localhost:4200/oauth2redirect`. Using the previous builder this was loading the `oauth2redirect/index.html` file.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating to the new `application` builder, this same URI throws the following error:\r\n```\r\nError: NG04002: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'oauth2redirect'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding a trailing slash to the URI (`localhost:4200/oauth2redirect/`). But this would require updating our OAuth redirect uri. And since this is something already supported by other tools and platforms (Google Cloud Buckets for example), I think it may be a good idea to support it here as well.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd some static `index.html` to an angular project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/\r\n  app/...\r\n  static/\r\n    oauth2redirect/\r\n      index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n// angular.json\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n    \"input\": \"src/static\",\r\n    \"output\": \"/\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nServe the app\r\n```sh\r\nng serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd try to load the file by using its parent folder.\r\n\r\nAll three URIs work with previous `browser` builder. And the first one fails with the new `application`  builder.\r\n```sh\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect # => error\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/ # => loads the file\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/index.hmtl # => loads the file\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@angular/material               17.3.10\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27949","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"serve: serving static files using vite differs from the previous builder\" (#27949)"},{"Id":"2379848680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-28T13:37:52","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27958","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): redirect to path with trailing slash for asset directories","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, accessing a static asset directory without a trailing slash resulted in a 404 error.

To enable the optimization, script optimization must be enabled as well as an environment variable `NG_BUILD_OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS=1`. This build step uses `rollup` internally to process the build files directly in memory. The main bundling performs all resolution, bundling, and tree-shaking of the application. The chunk optimizer step then only needs to access the in-memory built files and does not need to perform any disk access or module resolution. This allows the step to be performed fairly quickly but it does add time to the overall production build. The `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF=1` environment variable can be used to view how long the step takes within a build via the `OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS` entry. In the future, this optimization step may be automatically enabled based on initial file entry count and size. There are several current known issues:\r\n1) Bundle budgets for named lazy chunks may not work as expected.\r\n2) The console output may not show names (files will be present) for lazy chunk files.\r\n3) The stats file (`--stats-json` option) will not exactly reflect the final written application files.

in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm building an application that can load component templates from anywhere and use them as dynamic components in my application. With a fresh Angular 18 setup, this works perfectly fine, even with AOT, but when switching to the webpack builder (which we unfortunately need for unrelated reasons), I'm getting trouble with not being able to use any imported modules (including, e.g., CommonModule).\r\n\r\nWithout AOT, everything works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/aueelis/dynamic-template-issue\r\n\r\nIn `main.ts`, I fetch the `dynamic-template.html`, which is then used to create a simple `DynamicComponent`. This is then declared in a `DynamicModule`, which is also importing the `CommonModule` to support `*ngIf`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <ng-template #dynamicContainer></ng-template>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  name = 'Angular';\r\n\r\n  @ViewChild('dynamicContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true })\r\n  dynamicContainer: ViewContainerRef = {} as ViewContainerRef;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\r\n    this.httpClient\r\n      .get('dynamic-template.html', { responseType: 'text' })\r\n      .subscribe((template) => this.useTemplate(template));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private useTemplate(template: string): void {\r\n    const { component, moduleRef } = this.createDynamic(template);\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.clear();\r\n    this.dynamicContainer.createComponent(component, {\r\n      environmentInjector: moduleRef.injector,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createDynamic(template: string): {\r\n    component: any;\r\n    moduleRef: NgModuleRef<any>;\r\n  } {\r\n    const component = this.createComponent(template);\r\n    const module = this.createModule(component);\r\n    const moduleRef = createNgModule(module, this.dynamicContainer.injector);\r\n\r\n    return { component, moduleRef };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createComponent(template: string) {\r\n    return Component({\r\n      template,\r\n    })(class DynamicComponent {});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private createModule(component: any) {\r\n    return NgModule({\r\n      imports: [CommonModule],\r\n      declarations: [component],\r\n    })(class DynamicModule {});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, { providers: [provideHttpClient()] });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen switching from `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` (and renaming the option `browser` to `main` in `angular.json`, the application still compiles, but breaks during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic template for testing could be `<div *ngIf=\"true\">If you see this, it's working</div>`\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNG0303: Can't bind to 'ngIf' since it isn't a known property of 'div' (used in the 'DynamicComponent' component template).\r\nIf the 'ngIf' is an Angular control flow directive, please make sure that either the 'NgIf' directive or the 'CommonModule' is a part of an @NgModule where this component is

(Validated this happened 2x now after recreating project)\r\n6. Attempt to `rm -rf node_modules` and ` npm install` again.\r\n7. Attempt step 6 again, this time also deleting package.lock\r\n8.

Can't quit out like normal, it just hangs. I have left it running for upwards of 20 minutes, and it is still hanging. \r\n\r\nAlso, during the process of writing this, I did get it to finish a hung `ng new`, but it took over 45 minutes. It looks the same as my previous `ng new` which did not hang.\r\n\r\n## My package.json\r\n\r\nThe only difference from a new install is that I also installed angular material, but I would assume that my issue is probably related to the same one I had with my initial creation of the project, so I am posting it here and not in the angular material issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"my-proj\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"watch\": \"ng build --watch --configuration development\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^18.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^18.0.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.14.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^18.0.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^18.0.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^18.0.0\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~2.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.4.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attempts to remedy\r\n\r\nRemoving node_modules and reinstalling\r\nRemoving package.lock and reinstalling\r\n`npm cache clean --force`\r\n`npm cache validate`\r\nRestarting my machine\r\nRemoving angular material from the list of packages\r\nInstalling tslib myself\r\nInstalling run-applescript myself\r\nComplaining to my boss\r\nPraying\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ihormelgp/ng18-npm-i-brokey\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nnpm install --verbose always stuck on the following line\r\n\r\n...\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/eastasianwidth 4ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/fast-json-stable-stringify 4ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/bundle-name 5ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/default-browser-id 6ms (cache hit)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/run-applescript 3ms (cache hit)\r\n⠇\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.5\r\nNode: 20.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: <error>\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   <error>\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.5 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1 (cli-only)\r\ntypescript                      <error>\r\nzone.js                         <error>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nProlly a good idea to add that feature --verbose to `ng new` so people like me can give more details, but I think what I got is still pretty decent.

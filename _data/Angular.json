This is because the\r\nimplementation of the current way of creating a `UrlTree` attempts to\r\nlook up the `UrlSegment` of the `ActivatedRoute` in the currently active\r\n`UrlTree` of the router. When this doesn't work, the `UrlTree` creation\r\nfails.\r\n\r\nNote that this API does not replace the current one. That would actually be a\r\nbreaking change but should be done at some point in the future (v15). That is,\r\n`router.navigate` should call this new function. At that point, we can\r\nremove `_lastPathIndex`, `_urlSegment`, and `_correctedPathIndex` from\r\nthe `ActivatedRoute`, along with all of the logic associated with\r\ndetermining what those should be. In addition, this would unblock a fix\r\nfor https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26081 because the `applyRedirects` and `recognize` operations\r\ncould be combined into one.  Overall, this would simplify logic in the router\r\nand reduce code size. It also exposes core routing capabilities as a helper function\r\nwhich were previously private API, which is a necessary step towards https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/42953.\r\n\r\nAs a stress test for this new function, it _was_ swapped in as the\r\ndefault for `UrlTree` creation in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45859 and tested internally.

Running `ng completion` now finds the relevant `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc. file and adds the command to load Angular autocompletion for you, so users don't have to understand how to do it. `ng completion script` prints the actual shell script which needs to be evaluated in the shell (previously this was done by `ng completion` directly).\r\n\r\nThis also includes a prompt which is displayed to users on first command execution. After set up or if the user refuses the prompt, the CLI stores this state in the global workspace configuration and avoids prompting again. Users are expected to use `ng completion` if they want to set up autocompletion after previously refusing the prompt. This hopefully provides a good middle ground where users who might not be aware of the feature can discover it without being too annoying to users who have custom shell setups or don't want autocompletion.\r\n\r\nThe prompt is also skipped when running on CI, in a non-interactive terminal, when running `ng completion` or `ng update` commands, or if a run configuration for the current shell already has `ng completion script` in it (implying the user already set this up).\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end tests cover most of the flows, though there are a couple error conditions which are impractical to test. This required some modifications to test infrastructure to support passing stdin and environment variables in the right places. I also had to rewrite analytics tests to be more stable and not break from adding a new prompt.\r\n\r\nCloses #23003.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23060","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/cli): prompt to set up autocompletion and add `ng completion init`\" (#23060)"},{"Id":"1223091514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:23:26","Actor":"clydin","Number":"23067","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): introduce `addDependency` rule to utilities","State":"closed","Body":"An `addDependency` schematics rule has been added to the newly introduced `utility` subpath export for the `@schematics/angular` package.\r\nThis new rule allows for adding a package as a dependency to a `package.json`.

This greatly limits and even blocks some Angular applications.\r\n\r\nThere are timeswhen the actual index file of the app is hosted on a separate domain. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGiven the following criteria: \r\n* The build Angular app's assets are uploaded to a **cdn**. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/<contents-of-the-dist-folder>`\r\n* The `index.html` file of the app is then **\"deployed\"** to a separate domain. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/index.html` is moved to `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/index.html`\r\n\r\nThe combined use of `--deployUrl` and `--baseHref` gives Angular apps the ability to do this. \r\n\r\nHowever, this cannot be accomplished with _only using_ the `--baseHref` option. The two outcomes:\r\n1. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **cdn** (ie. `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/...`)\r\n    * assets are able to load\r\n    * route _throws an error_ and does not load the app (see error below)\r\n2. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **\"deployed\"** domain (ie. `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/`)\r\n    * assets _cannot load_ because they are not uploaded to **deployed** domain\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a minimum reproduction repo. It has a detailed README with setup and testing instructions. It also adds a little more context and clarity around the difference between a **cdn** url and the **deployed** url. \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/djhouseknecht/angular-deploy-url-repro\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Unhandled Navigation Error: SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'http://localhost:8080/fake-cdn/#/' cannot be created in a document with origin 'http://localhost:4200' and URL 'http://localhost:4200/thor/'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n> Error is taken from the mini repo above\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nExtra relevant information in the minimum repo.

Without the option, all direct and transitive\r\ndependencies would have their scripts executed during the task's package manager installation operation.\r\nThe change only affects the package manager behavior controlled by the Schematics `NodePackageInstallTask`.\r\n\r\nFirst-party Angular schematics do not currently require any direct or transitive dependency\r\n`install`/`postinstall` scripts to execute. Only two dependencies within a v14.0 new project would\r\npotentially be affected by this: `nice-napi` (transitive from `piscina`) and `esbuild`. The `nice-napi`\r\nfunctionality of `piscina` is unused within the Angular CLI with no plans to use it in the future.\r\nEven if it was used, the `install` script runs `node-gyp-build` which would only have an effect\r\n(based on the current version 1.0.2) on platforms that are not Windows, darwin-x64, or linux-x64.\r\nIn the event this functionality is eventually used, the Angular CLI could be setup to automatically execute\r\nthis particular script for unsupported platforms.

So for example, today is Ordibehesht 12th but material datepicker is showing Ordibehesht 13th. Moreover, when I choose a date in the datepicker, for example (۱۹/۴/۱۳۷۶), the datepicker closes and the date that is shown in the input isn't actually what I chose. Instead it's (۱۷/۴/۱۳۷۶).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://components-issue-mle1fv.stackblitz.io\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFor today's date to be shown correctly and the input value to be the same as the date selected.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nToday's date is not shown correctly and the input value of the datepicker is not the same as the date selected.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.3.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.3.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24861","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DATEPICKER): dateAdapter.setLocale('fa') not working properly\" (#24861)"},{"Id":"1222211801","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-02T07:08:50","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"24858","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(THEMING): How do we theme component overlays (Dropdown, Snackbox...)?","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\n\nI've asked about how to Theme overlays (Dropdown, snackbox, etc.) on Stackoverflow here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/72074206/rendering-overlay-containers-when-theming-angular-material\r\n\r\nI also created a github repository that shows what I'm trying to do per the tutorials that I have found on the subject.\r\n\r\nRight now I can't get the dropdown to apply the dark theme, but everything else works fine.

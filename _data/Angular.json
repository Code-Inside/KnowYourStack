Just let me explain.\r\n\r\n- We have an angular workspace that contains:\r\n  - `foo-lib`: A library that is going to be used in `foo-app` (below)\r\n    - Contains `AlphaModule`, which declares and exports `AlphaComponent`\r\n    - Also contains `BetaModule`, which declares and exports `BetaComponent`\r\n    - Both being exported via the lib's public-api.ts\r\n  - `foo-app`: An Application that uses the router for lazy loading\r\n    - theres an `AppModule`, an eagerly loaded startup module of the app\r\n      - The `AppComponent`, declared and bootstrapped by the `AppModule`, only uses the `AlphaComponent` from the lib above\r\n    - and theres a `LazyModule`, which is loaded lazily in the `AppRoutingModule` as described here: https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules\r\n      - The `LazyComponent`, declared and routed to via `LazyRoutingModule`, only uses the `BetaComponent` from the lib above\r\n\r\n## Expectation:\r\n\r\nFollowing the description above, when I build the app, I expect the final JS bundles...\r\n- to have the `AlphaComponent` only referenced in the main.js bundle\r\n- and to have the `BetaComponoent` only referenced in the lazy.js bundle\r\n\r\nBecause that's the point of doing lazy loading huh? Having stuff, that is not required in the main bundle, moved to their respective lazy loaded bundles, where it's actually needed\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIn our production app, we once noticed a huge amount of unused JS inside our main bundle, reported by core web vitals measurements tool.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis identified an internal angular component library of ours as main problem and revealed that the expectation written above is actually false:\r\n\r\n- As long as we use the lib *only* in our lazy module, everything is fine. The stuff we reference from the lib only appears in the lazy.js bundle\r\n- But as soon as we use stuff from the lib also in our AppModule or components that directly or indirectly belong to it, everything else from the lib which is only used in lazy modules, also goes to the main.js bundle when compiling\r\n- Referencing the example drawn above that means\r\n  - The main.js bundle actually contains both `AlphaComponent` and `BetaComponent` from the lib, although `BetaComponent` is not used in any way in the `AppModule`, but only in the `LazyModule`\r\n  - When we remove all `AlphaComponent` and `AlphaModule` references from our `AppModule` and components that belong eagerly to it, we find out that the `BetaComponent` now is actually contained in the lazy bundle, and not in the main bundle any more, that part follows my expectation.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nHowever, the things written above are only true as long as the library only has one single entry point. This is the case for our internal component library. Each individual component is wrapped inside its own NgModule and most of them have no cross references between each other, it's mainly a collection of reusable ui-components. So we can always import only those NgModules we actually need, always thought we'd rely on tree shaking to reduce the bundle to what's actually being used (which is true unless you use lazy loading and reference the lib from different routes)\r\n\r\nAs soon as we create seperate secondary entry points for each entity in the lib which is meant to be used independently, the problem does not occur any longer.\r\n\r\nI also tried that with non-angular libs (normal npm package with some typescript stuff being exported) - same issue.\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\n\r\nIs it a bug?\r\n\r\nIs it a problem, may it be known or unknown, which exists but is currently not resolvable (unless using sepearte entry points in the lib)? If that's the case, I think it should be mentioned in the docs about lazy loading, otherwise I don't think most devs are aware of this problem and just run into the same trap as we did.

Apparently the resizing is working when a material-theme like indigo-pink.css is present and included in angular.json.\r\n\r\n`                        \"styles\": [\r\n                            \"./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n                            \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n                        ]`\r\n\r\nAt first that didnt make a lot of sense to me so i started debugging a bit aswell. Apparently with this stylesheet present the method **measureScrollHeight** in [autosize.ts](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/text-field/autosize.ts) is yielding a different result as when this stylesheet is not present. After checking the method i saw that there are some classes beeing added. So my suspection is that maybe one of those is missing without the stylesheet beeing present. After that i didnt proceed to check more and hope that this gives a direction how one can proceed solving this.\r\n\r\nA minimal **working** repo with styles in angular.json can also be found here ( https://github.com/maro1993/resize-example )\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nreproduction repo of the **bug** ->  https://github.com/maro1993/resize-example-cdk\r\n\r\na working example with an material theme beeing included and material package beeing added in package.json https://github.com/maro1993/resize-example\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nexpect textarea to resize ( more details in the description)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\ntextarea did not resize ( more details in the description)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 99.0.4844.51 (Offizieller Build) (64-Bit), Firefox 91.5.1esr (64-Bit\r\n- Operating System Windows 10\r\n\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^13.2.6\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^13.2.6\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.5.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.11.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~13.2.6\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~13.2.6\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~13.2.0\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.10.0\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~6.3.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~1.7.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.5.2\"\r\n  }","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24568","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdkTextareaAutosize): Resizing only works properly if material styles are included\" (#24568)"},{"Id":"1165823883","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-10T23:13:32","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"24569","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): re-enter the Angular zone when the `NgZone.onStable` emits","State":"open","Body":"The `NgZone.onStable` always emits outside of the Angular zone, but the zone has not been\r\nre-entered.

version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen programmatically updating a form property that happens to be an object with the same previous value, the `mat-radio-button` gets unchecked. When the form property is a string or a number, there's no problem.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nLink: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-lxats5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. After the application is done loading, you can see the different options being programmatically selected after a couple seconds, except when data `{ id: 3 }` is set more than once;\r\n2. Once this happens, the third option is unchecked, even though the form property still has the correct value;\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected the mat-radio-button option to be selected correctly, even when the form property is updated with the same value more than once. There should be no difference if the value is a string or an object, since the `[checked]=condition` is supposed to take care of the checking rule.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe mat-radio-button option is unchecked when its form property is updated with the same value more than once.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.2.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24559","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-radio-group): Programmatically updating a form property with the same object value unchecks its mat-radio-button option\" (#24559)"},{"Id":"1164313220","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-09T18:49:43","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"24558","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/menu): Use DI instead of CdkMenuPanel to connect menus","State":"open","Body":"This PR aims to simplify the API by eliminating `MenuPanel`, which was a directive that existed purely to glue together other components and directives.

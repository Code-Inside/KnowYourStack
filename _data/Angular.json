This is clearly wrong -- an extraneous `FormControl` has been added!\r\n\r\nThis is coming from the calculation of the result type of `fb.group(...)`. In the type definition, if we cannot detect the outer control type, [we assume it's just an unwrapped value, and automatically wrap it in `FormControl`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/14.0.0/packages/forms/src/form_builder.ts#L66).\r\n\r\nBecause the optional `{address?: FormControl<string|null>}` implicitly makes the RHS have type `FormControl<string|null>|undefined`, [the relevant condition is not satisfied](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/14.0.0/packages/forms/src/form_builder.ts#L55). In particular, the condition expects just `FormGroup<T>`, not `FormGroup<T>|undefined`. So we assume `T` is a value type, and it gets wrapped with `FormControl`.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add the cases where `undefined` is included in the union type when detecting which control `T` is (if any).\r\n\r\nGoogle-internal bug: b/234856858\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46253","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): allow FormBuilder.group(...) to accept optional fields.\" (#46253)"},{"Id":"1260401983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-03T21:27:35","Actor":"mgameover","Number":"46252","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 14 doesn't build library with multiple entry points","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler, upgrade\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi everyone,\r\nI am about to migrate from v13 to v14, but I faced with the following issue. \r\nWhen I try to build library project it fails **on the first entry point which has reference to another entry** with the error:\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBuilding entry point 'xxx'\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n✖ Compiling with Angular sources in Ivy partial compilation mode.\r\nPATH_TO_TS - error TS2305: Module '\"yyy\"' has no exported member 'xyz'.\r\n```\r\nBut the thing is that everything is in place and it works fine with ng v13.

This causes CI builds to hang indefinitely on any step that runs Angular unit tests using this command.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Run `npm i @angular/cli@13 -g` to Install Angular CLI 13.\r\n- Run `ng new` to create a new Angular application. I chose to add Angular routing and selected SCSS for the stylesheet format. Selecting SCSS seems to be required to reproduce the issue, but adding routing does not.\r\n- Run `ng test --watch=false` and observe the tests running, then the process terminating after completion.\r\n- Run `npm i @angular/cli@14 -g` to install Angular CLI 14.\r\n- Run `ng test --watch=false`. The message `Your global Angular CLI version (14.0.0) is greater than your local version (13.3.7). The local Angular CLI version is used.` will be displayed. Observe the tests running, then the process continuing to run even after the tests complete.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step

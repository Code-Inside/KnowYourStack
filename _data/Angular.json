Resources are asynchronous dependencies that are managed and delivered through the signal graph. Resources are defined by their reactive request function and their asynchronous loader, which retrieves the value of the resource for a given request value. For example, a \"current user\" resource may retrieve data for the current user, where the request function derives the API call to make from a signal of the current user id.\r\n    \r\nResources are represented by the `Resource<T>` type, which includes signals for the resource's current value as well as its state. `WritableResource<T>` extends that type to allow for local mutations of the resource through its `value` signal (which is therefore two-way bindable).\r\n\r\nAlso, implementations of two rxjs-interop APIs which produce `Resource`s from RxJS Observables. `rxResource()` is a flavor of `resource()` which uses a projection to an `Observable` as its loader (like `switchMap`).\r\n\r\n`toResource()` is a convenience wrapper which behaves like `toSignal()` but produces a `Resource` instead. This has several advantages for async Observables: it exposes the loading status, and it can be mutated locally (it returns a `WritableResource`).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58255","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Experimental Resource API\" (#58255)"},{"Id":"2596041862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-18T00:12:20","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"58254","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Protractor usage to use private name","State":"open","Body":"This updates the angular/angular repo to not be broken by https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28632.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm just locally patching the change and testing CI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58254","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update Protractor usage to use private name\" (#58254)"},{"Id":"2595683562","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-17T22:58:33","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"58252","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): fix flaky hydration test","State":"closed","Body":"This clears the DebugConsole between each test, which should address cross-test console noise.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58252","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(core): fix flaky hydration test\" (#58252)"},{"Id":"2595760499","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-17T21:11:25","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"58253","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update io_bazel_rules_sass digest to 43a9cda","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| io_bazel_rules_sass | http_archive | digest | `9fa2d50` -> `43a9cda` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Without it, when using JIT, the component is treated as non-standalone. This is evident from the CI failures in the CLI, as seen in this action log: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/actions/runs/11381536444/job/31663165655?pr=28654, where we attempted to remove `standalone: true`.\n\nMoreover, in `@angular/core`, there are still a few places where standalone hasn't been fully adopted as the default setting.

If the answer is no the angular team would be able to point to this issue for all future feature requests of this nature.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28661","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Managing large amounts of environment variables\" (#28661)"},{"Id":"2595280206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-17T17:03:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28659","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): create component stylesheet bundler at start of build","State":"open","Body":"**refactor(@angular/build): move component stylesheet bundler out of compiler plugin**\r\n\r\nThe component stylesheet bundler is now created during the setup of the Angular\r\ncompiler plugin options.

On deprecated MatTreeControl, the same method was able to expand the entire tree without problems.\n\nNote: the deprecated control had an advantage that the expansion state could be manipulated before even the view was initialized, but that is another topic.\n\nWORKAROUND: \n\n```typescript\nthis.dataSource.forEach(node => this.tree.expandDescendants(node));\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Flat nodes: https://stackblitz.com/edit/rk3djh\n- Nested nodes: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mv8yub\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the demos.\n2. The tree is partially expanded\n3. Edit the demo and enable the workaround on the `ngAfterViewInit` callback.\n4. The tree is now fully expanded.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMatTree's expandAll()  should expand all nodes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the first level nodes are expanded.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chromium\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux (Fedora)\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29865","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTree): expandAll() only expand the first level\" (#29865)"},{"Id":"2581531969","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-11T14:34:30","Actor":"jumbolu","Number":"29864","RawContent":null,"Title":"[bug] stepper icons - accessibility - icon hidden text read as a separated tab in screen-reader","State":"open","Body":"Hello, \n\nI am questioned by the accessibility testers while using Stepper.  \n\n1. The icons in stepper-header are considered as decorative icons (aria-hidden=\"true\") except \"edit\" and \"done\". I am suggested the \"number\" icons are meaningful, and should be read by the screen-reader as \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\", etc. \n\n2. The indicator icons (edit and done) are read as a separated tab in the screen-reader:\n - \"tab Editable\" then followed by \"tab matStepLabel\" \n - \"tab Completed\" then followed by \"tab matStepLabel\"  \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65166385-c509-4333-9521-fc9386728573)\n\nAny comments or suggestions to address these accessibility concerns?

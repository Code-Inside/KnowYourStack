The type of the provided value is compatible with the token.\r\n2. The `multi: true` option is not missing or mistakenly added\r\n\r\nFor libraries, in order to ensure type-safe providing, it has been a common pattern to create `provideXxx` helpers. However, in daily application development, the providng experience is still non-type-safe.\r\n\r\nSince all the `ProviderToken`s carry type information, it is possible to create framework-level providing helpers to ensure type safety.\r\n\r\nI have created such helper functions and fully adopted it in all my projects.  \r\nI would like to create a PR to introduce these helpers to `@angular/core` to enable a safer providing experience for all Angular developers.\r\n\r\nPlease see below for details.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n## Signatures\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provide<T, U extends T>(config: ProvideConfig<T, U>): Provider;\r\nfunction provideMulti<T>(config: ProvideMultiConfig<T>): Provider;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprovide({ token: TitleStrategy, useClass: AppTitleStrategy });\r\nprovide({ token: TitleStrategy, useExisting: AppTitleStrategy });\r\n// `AppTitleStrategy` have to be assignable to `TitleStrategy`.\r\n\r\ndeclare const SNACKBAR_CONFIG: InjectionToken<SnackbarConfig>;\r\nprovide({ token: SNACKBAR_CONFIG, useValue: { ... } });\r\n// Type of `useValue` is inferred as `SnackbarConfig`, enabling autocomplete.\r\n\r\ndeclare const BREAKPOINTS: InjectionToken<BreakpointMap>\r\nprovide({ token: BREAKPOINTS, useFactory: (observer = inject(BreakpointObserver)) => observer.observe() });\r\n// Return type of the factory has to match `BreakpointMap`\r\n\r\nprovide({ token: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: () => () => {} });\r\n// Type error. APP_INITIALIZER should be an array of functions, but the return type of the factory is a single function.\r\n// Type '() => void' is not assignable to type 'readonly (() => void | Observable<unknown> | Promise<unknown>)[]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprovideMulti({ token: TitleStrategy, useClass: AppTitleStrategy });\r\n// Type error. TitleStrategy does not support multi providing.\r\n// Argument of type '{ token: typeof TitleStrategy; useClass: typeof AppTitleStrategy; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.\r\n\r\nprovideMulti({ token: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: () => () => {} });\r\n// Legit. The return type of the factory matches the item type of APP_INITIALIZER\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function provide<T, U extends T>(config: ProvideConfig<T, U>): Provider {\r\n  if ('useValue' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useValue: config.useValue };\r\n  if ('useFactory' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useFactory: config.useFactory };\r\n  if ('useClass' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useClass: config.useClass };\r\n  if ('useExisting' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useExisting: config.useExisting };\r\n  throw new Error('Invalid config'); // impossible to happen\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function provideMulti<T>(config: ProvideMultiConfig<T>): Provider {\r\n  return {\r\n    ...provide(config as ProvideConfig<any>),\r\n    multi: true,\r\n  } as Provider;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type ProvideConfig<T, U extends T = T> = ProvideConfigToken<T> &\r\n  ProvideConfigUse<U>;\r\n\r\nexport type ProvideMultiConfig<T> = ProvideConfigToken<T> &\r\n  (T extends readonly (infer I)[] ? ProvideConfigUse<I> : never);\r\n\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigToken<T> {\r\n  token: ProviderToken<T>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport type ProvideConfigUse<T> =\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseValue<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseFactory<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseClass<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseExisting<T>;\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseValue<T> {\r\n  useValue: T;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseFactory<T> {\r\n  useFactory: () => T;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseClass<T> {\r\n  useClass: Type<T>;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseExisting<T> {\r\n  useExisting: ProviderToken<T>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55555","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature] Introduce Type-safe Token Providing\" (#55555)"},{"Id":"2264641351","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T23:12:15","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55554","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): link errors to ADEV","State":"open","Body":"Console error links will now point to adev.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55554","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): link errors to ADEV\" (#55554)"},{"Id":"2264632079","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T23:00:57","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55553","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs cleanup.","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits. \r\n\r\nfixes angular#54227\r\nfixes angular#50943\r\nfixes angular#49566\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55553","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Docs cleanup.\" (#55553)"},{"Id":"2264597916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T22:30:25","Actor":"guiseek","Number":"55552","RawContent":null,"Title":"Form input mask provided by the framework","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nExcept for tiny apps, practically all others need to mask form inputs, such as currency, phone number, identity documents, etc.\r\n\r\nthe framework could offer this feature and help teams stop wasting time choosing third-party libraries, as few actually do a good job, in addition to many of them abandoning the project and contributing to the project becoming legacy\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt could be a directive within the @angular/forms package.

When using ZoneJS, these listeners are most often executed in the Angular Zone as well, so synchronization (`ApplicationRef.tick`) will eventually happen. _However_, developers can opt out of zone-patching for events in several ways, and often do this for very frequent listeners like `mousemove`, `resize`, and `scroll`. We do not want to break existing expectations that these are now \"safe\" events to have listeners for by automatically scheduling change detection regardless of whether the listener executed inside or outside the Angular zone.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in order for developers to more easily transition to zoneless, we need to be able to ensure that components which are using `OnPush` are, for the most part, compatible with zoneless as well. Because listeners automatically mark the component for check, developers using `OnPush` did not/do not need to also call `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck` or a similar API. Unfortunately, this means that we need to consider the listener callbacks as a notification to schedule a `tick` when Zoneless is enabled. In the future, we would like to have an opt-out for this (i.e. signal components) since it's not really how we _want_ things to work.\r\n\r\nAlso includes the fix for #54919 that got reverted only because it was easier to revert the set of conflicting commits\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55525","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): Omit listeners from out-of-zone scheduling when using…\" (#55525)"},{"Id":"2263531748","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:53:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"55530","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): set up framework injector profile exclusively in browser environment","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis commit modifies the setup of the injector profiler to occur solely when the application is running in a browser context.

To approach this, we need to use the wildcard route ** in order to handle the loading of the requested Storyblok pages (done via slugs taken from the url path). The static site generation works as expected, however, the loading times of the static html page is very slow and takes around 1.5s.\r\n\r\nAfter analysing various potential causes for the problem, we noticed that the wildcard route seems to be root of the issue. If we define a static route and load the static HTML page via the Storyblok JS Client server side, it is blazingly fast and only takes around 20ms. Alas, defining static routes is not really an option for us since our client needs to create pages dynamically on the CMS side.\r\n\r\nThe loading times differ by a factor of around 40, so it's a massive difference.\r\n\r\nWe created a small reproduction project with a very trivial HttpClient GET request to an open API to display a JSON on screen. Although the difference in loading times is not as huge as with our real project, it is still a lot and should suffice to illustrate to problem. (Difference by a factor of around 20)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/slemont3/angular17-ssr-routing-delay/tree/main\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nEverything is described above.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.3.5\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nA probably related issue was already reported here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55021\r\n\r\nWe did try to use a path variable instead of a wildcard route and it results in exactly the same behaviour.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55529","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 17 SSR: Slow server response time when using wildcard route\" (#55529)"},{"Id":"2262992765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T08:36:31","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"55528","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test something","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55528","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Test something\" (#55528)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2264262608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:05:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27538","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): check both potential build packages in Angular version check","State":"closed","Body":"The compatible Angular version check now supports getting the SemVer range of a compatible `@angular/compiler-cli` package from both this package and `@angular-devkit/build-angular` if present.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.6`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next6-2024-04-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-next.5...18.0.0-next.6)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### animations\n\n-   Deprecated `matchesElement` method has been removed from `AnimationDriver` as it is unused.\n\n##### core\n\n-   `async` has been removed, use `waitForAsync` instead.\n\n##### http\n\n-   By default we now prevent caching of HTTP requests that require authorization . To opt-out from this behaviour use the `includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders` option in `withHttpTransferCache`.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```ts\n    withHttpTransferCache({\n      includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders: true,\n    })\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   Deprecated `StateKey`, `TransferState` and `makeStateKey` have been removed from `@angular/platform-browser`, use the same APIs from `@angular/core`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   `getCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleCurrencyCode`, `getLocaleCurrencyName`, `getLocaleCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleDateFormat`, `getLocaleDateTimeFormat`, `getLocaleDayNames`, `getLocaleDayPeriods`, `getLocaleDirection`, `getLocaleEraNames`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriodRules`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriods`, `getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek`, `getLocaleId`, `getLocaleMonthNames`, `getLocaleNumberFormat`, `getLocaleNumberSymbol`, `getLocalePluralCase`, `getLocaleTimeFormat`, `getLocaleWeekEndRange`, `getNumberOfCurrencyDigits`\n\n##### http\n\n-   `HttpClientModule`, `HttpClientXsrfModule` and `HttpClientJsonpModule`\n\n    As mentionned, those modules can be replaced by provider function only.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [bcce85af72](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bcce85af72a82634f60b31d66a5ef42ecd844ce8) | refactor | remove deprecated `matchesElement` from `AnimationDriver` ([#&#8203;55479](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55479)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d34c033902](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d34c033902b4e7543796de6c57d0cfd09093eb43) | refactor | Deprecate Local Data API functions ([#&#8203;54483](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54483)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7a16d7e969](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7a16d7e969eaf5a9475ffdd21a4bf637ce523856) | fix | don't type check the bodies of control flow nodes in basic mode ([#&#8203;55360](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55360)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a730f09ae9](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a730f09ae9e729da79a3e0951e15e0139ef67713) | feat | Add a public API to establish events to be replayed and an attribute to mark an element with an event handler.

manually.\r\n\r\nSometimes we somehow use ESNext features like Array.prototype.flatMap but forget adding its polyfill into polyfills.ts, it accidentally breaks on some browsers.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/alauda, we are using [@alauda/custom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alauda/custom-webpack) which pipes babel-loader after @ngtools/webpack in webpack config, so that we get auto polyfilling successfully via @babel/preset-env.\r\n\r\nSo I'm suggesting to add auto polyfilling support into @angular/cli.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf we can build all .ts via @ngtools/webpack with targeting esnext, then we can use babel to compiling all ES syntaxes totally but are able to get types metadata still at the same time.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27510","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[reopen] [proposal] auto polyfilling support via @babel/preset-env\"

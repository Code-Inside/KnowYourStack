In the issue described below, UI elements that are no longer used are not garbage collected when the Angular Browser Animation Module is imported in a multi-page Angular application in connection with Angular ShadowDom components. \r\n\r\n### Supposed bug of the Browser Animation module\r\nIn multi-page Angular applications which imports the Animation Module, the createRender method of the RenererFactory2 is called at every page change (call-stack: createComponent -> componentFactory.create -> rendererFactory.createRenderer) to create an animation renderer. This animation renderer contains the various information to be able to run animations.\r\n\r\nFor each component of a view to be created, the create Renderer method is called and it is checked whether a cutsom animation is set for the respective component or not. If this is the case, a custom renderer will be created (that will not get cached), otherwise a base renderer should be used. To do this, a delegate is created from the information of the respective component (see the next chapter for more information on how the delegate gets created) and it is checked whether a renderer has already been cached for such a component. If so, the renderer is returned from the cache, otherwise a new base renderer is created and saved.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// internal Angular code from the RendererFactory2: \r\ncreateRenderer(hostElement, type) {\r\n        const EMPTY_NAMESPACE_ID = '';\r\n        // cache the delegates to find out which cached delegate can\r\n        // be used by which cached renderer\r\n        const delegate = this.delegate.createRenderer(hostElement, type);\r\n        if (!hostElement || !type || !type.data || !type.data['animation']) {\r\n            let renderer = this._rendererCache.get(delegate);\r\n            if (!renderer) {\r\n                renderer = new BaseAnimationRenderer(EMPTY_NAMESPACE_ID, delegate, this.engine);\r\n                // only cache this result when the base renderer is used\r\n                this._rendererCache.set(delegate, renderer);\r\n            }\r\n            return renderer;\r\n        }\r\n        // else custom renderer...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs just described, the renderers of the Browser Animation Module are cached so that they can be returned when a previous page is called up again. However, the analysis has shown that caching sometimes does not work correctly, and a new renderer is always created for some components.\r\n\r\nThe cache is a simple map that keeps a delegate as a key and the renderer as a value. The delegate is created based on the respective component. I noticed in the applications I work on professionally that the components that lead to the re-creation of a renderer are themselves relatively small, which is why one could ask why this leads to the large detached elements and the memory problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that even a small component like a breadcrumb component holds references to all other components of a view through the child and parent node properties. Thus, for example, a table with very large amounts of data will not get correctly garbage collected. This is the reason why the browser uses more and more memory by navigating through the multi-page application until the application crashes.\r\n\r\n### Why does caching sometimes not work correctly?\r\nThe problem is in the created delegate, which is used as a key inside the map. The delegate is created via a createRenderer method, which in turn iterates through what type of component (what viewEncapsulation) it is to return the correct renderer.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// create the delegate\r\nconst delegate = this.delegate.createRenderer(hostElement, type);\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n// the called createRenderer Method\r\ncreateRenderer(element: any, type: RendererType2|null): Renderer2 {\r\n  if (!element || !type) {\r\n    return this.defaultRenderer;\r\n  }\r\n  switch (type.encapsulation) {\r\n    case ViewEncapsulation.Emulated: {\r\n      let renderer = this.rendererByCompId.get(type.id);\r\n      if (!renderer) {\r\n        renderer = new EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2(\r\n          this.eventManager, this.sharedStylesHost, type, this.appId);\r\n        this.rendererByCompId.set(type.id, renderer);\r\n      }\r\n      (<EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2>renderer).applyToHost(element);\r\n      return renderer;\r\n    }\r\n    // @ts-ignore TODO: Remove as part of FW-2290. TS complains about us dealing with an enum\r\n    // value that is not known (but previously was the value for ViewEncapsulation.Native)\r\n    case 1:\r\n    case ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom:\r\n      // TODO(FW-2290): remove the `case 1:` fallback logic and the warning in v12.\r\n      if ((typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) &&\r\n        // @ts-ignore TODO: Remove as part of FW-2290. TS complains about us dealing with an\r\n        // enum value that is not known (but previously was the value for\r\n        // ViewEncapsulation.Native)\r\n        !hasLoggedNativeEncapsulationWarning && type.encapsulation === 1) {\r\n        hasLoggedNativeEncapsulationWarning = true;\r\n        console.warn(\r\n          'ViewEncapsulation.Native is no longer supported. Falling back to ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom. The fallback will be removed in v12.');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return new ShadowDomRenderer(this.eventManager, this.sharedStylesHost, element, type);\r\n    default: {\r\n      if (!this.rendererByCompId.has(type.id)) {\r\n        const styles = flattenStyles(type.id, type.styles, []);\r\n        this.sharedStylesHost.addStyles(styles);\r\n        this.rendererByCompId.set(type.id, this.defaultRenderer);\r\n      }\r\n      return this.defaultRenderer;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/dom_renderer.ts#L91)\r\n\r\nIn the case of components that are of the ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom type, we have the memory leak problem. In contrast to the other cases, the component itself is stored as a property in the renderer, which contains the references to the other components of a view.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new object of the ShadowDomRenderer to be created is always created here, which also leads to the problem that the correct entry in the renderer cache is not found. So instead of using the already created ShadowDomRenderer, a new one is cached with every page change.\r\n\r\n### Demo to recreate\r\nI have created a small demo in which the problem can be well understood. I recommend using the Microsoft Edge browser for this, as it has a dev tool function that can be used to easily filter out the detached elements.\r\n\r\nThe demo includes three simple pages that can be accessed via buttons. The first page itself uses an Angular component that uses ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom. The second page accesses a component with ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom and the third page does not use a ShadowDom.\r\n\r\nIf you switch back and forth between the pages several times, you can see how more and more detached elements are built up by the first and second page, while the third page does not produce any detached elements.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64976254/198289765-df743570-7363-497e-88a1-6f9f30df2da2.png)\r\n\r\nThis also makes it easy to understand that all UI elements remain on the second page, even though only one child element uses the ShadowDom. In addition, this problem also exists even though no animations of the module are actively used at all.\r\n\r\n### Monkey Patch\r\nIn my work, I'm programming on larger Angular applications that use ShadowDom components and suffer from this memory leak problem. I will be very happy when the supposedly incorrect behavior is adjusted in an Angular update.\r\n\r\nUntil then, I like to share a monkeyPatch with you that you can use to adjust the behavior of RendererFactory2 and its cache to prevent the memory leak problem in your applications:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n  constructor(\r\n    // ...\r\n    rendererFactory2: RendererFactory2,\r\n  ) {\r\n    // 😱\r\n    (rendererFactory2 as any)['_rendererCache'] = new WeakMap();\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThe weak reference allows the browser's garbage collector to dispose of the object as soon as there is no other reference to the object. After a page change, only the renderer cache will reference UI elements that are no longer required (weak) and the detached elements will be removed as desired.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jonas383649/angular-memory-leak-problem.git\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.7\r\nNode: 14.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.8\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.7\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47892","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components not being garbage collected by browser causing major memory leaks\" (#47892)"},{"Id":"1425500285","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T11:45:06","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"47891","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: improve grammer in CLI command template","State":"open","Body":"Before\r\n```\r\nThis command has the following commands:\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow\r\n```\r\nThis command has the following sub-commands:\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47891","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: improve grammer in CLI command template\" (#47891)"},{"Id":"1425108658","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T11:37:13","Actor":"christianliebel","Number":"47887","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: allow specifying NgZone options for `createApplication()`","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v5.2.1`](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v5.2.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/compare/v5.2.0...v5.2.1)\n\n#### 🚀 Highlights\n\n-   **Accordion**\n    -   Update `color` value to use the `$accordion-button-color` Sass variable instead of our color contrast function\n-   **Buttons**\n    -   Added a `transparent` default hover border color CSS variable for buttons to fix a visual regression\n    -   `.btn-link` no longer has a gradient when `$enable-gradients` is set to `true`\n-   **Forms**\n    -   Input groups have updated `z-index` values to ensure proper rendering of validated form fields\n    -   Floating labels now reset their `text-align` to ensure consistent styling\n-   **List Groups**\n    -   Horizontal list groups with only one child now render the correct `border-radius`\n    -   Modified the `list-group-item` selectors to better support nested imports of Bootstrap's CSS\n-   **Modals**\n    -   Fixed modal event listeners during dismiss click, allowing you to once again click scrollbars without dismissing the modal\n-   **Pagination**\n    -   Fixed incorrect `border-radius` values inside pagination components\n-   **Scrollspy**\n    -   Scrollspy threshold option is now configurable\n-   **Tooltips**\n    -   Reverted some tooltip plugin updates to prevent issues with `selector`, dynamic content, and disposed tooltips using `title`\n\n#### 🚀 Features\n\n-   [#&#8203;36750](https://togithub.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/36750): ScrollSpy: make the threshold option configurable\n\n#### 🎨 CSS\n\n-

We come from three projects that rely on parse5 — namely [Cheerio](https://togithub.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), [rehype](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).\n\n**We need your support to continue the project!** If you care about parse5, please support us financially on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/parse5).\n\nHeadlining features of this release are ES Modules, TypeScript, and performance improvements: 7.0.0 is 45% faster than 6.0.1 with default options, and 167% faster with location information enabled (for the `bench/perf` benchmark, on an M1 Mac). Version 7.0.0 is a revamp of every part of the library. There are too many changes to list them all here, so here is a high-level overview:\n\n##### Breaking: ESM\n\nAll of parse5’s packages are now ECMAScript Modules. We are providing dual packages for `parse5` and `parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter` for now (see [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418) and [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496)).\n\nTo migrate, please read [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) on how to update. Note that private internals are no longer available; instead, everything that you need should be imported from the main package.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j) in [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/351)*\n\n##### Breaking: TypeScript\n\nThe codebase has been ported to TypeScript. This helped uncover a number of subtle logic bugs, such as [`dc4e269`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/dc4e269022ebbae0767d8f790a29d6be1835fe1e), [`b4b5d4a`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/b4b5d4ad6f90b3c9fd03a90e2ed5267929979a11), or [`a0aff95`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/a0aff9578bb44511bc169c1d7f9e2f2780f7f8a0). TypeScript also helps us refactor with confidence and a lot of the changes in this release would have been much harder to do without it.\n\nTo migrate, please remove `@types/parse5*` as we now ship our own types.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;fb55](https://togithub.com/fb55) in [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362)*\n\n##### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   parse5 was caught up with the HTML spec, and parsing results might differ in edge-cases ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451))\n-   The `parse5-serializer-stream` package was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481)\n    -   To migrate, use the `serialize` function exported by `parse5`.\n-   The rewriting stream now splits very long text sections ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434)) and doesn’t escape text in special tags anymore ([#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/434)). If you worked around these issues before, you might have to update your code.\n-   The htmlparser2 adapter now uses `domhandler`’s node interface ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327) by [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound))\n    -   The format of the tree nodes has changed slightly; eg. some previous properties are now getters and setters, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are using deep imports for any parts of the codebase, you will likely encounter some breakages:\n\n<details><summary>Show internal changes</summary>\n\n-   The tokenizer now uses the state machine pattern from htmlparser2 [`5d7a780` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/5d7a780b70d3669def4c6bb20cbec816804d44a5)\n-   The token queue was replaced with callbacks ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419))\n-   The `OpenElementStack` now uses callbacks [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429)\n-   Mixins were removed (as part of [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362))\n    -   Location tracking now has a substantially lower overhead [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402)\n-   `getNextToken` was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461)\n-   The parser’s `_bootstrap` method was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384)\n-   We now drop chunks from the tokenizer right after they are emitted [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432)\n-   The serializer is no longer a class; instead, different serializer functions call on each other [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383)\n-   parse5 now uses the `entities` module for encoding and decoding entities, sharing maintenance & optimisation work with projects such as htmlparser2 ([`2b92054` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/2b9205458b9305de1406966568567ccfc1633fa1), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486))\n    -   `entities` adopted a variant of parse5’s approach of decoding entities.

However inside the source code (paginator.ts), that event is emitted at the end of the function:\r\n```  \r\n_changePageSize(pageSize: number) {\r\n    // Current page needs to be updated to reflect the new page size. Navigate to the page\r\n    // containing the previous page's first item.\r\n    const startIndex = this.pageIndex * this.pageSize;\r\n    const previousPageIndex = this.pageIndex;\r\n\r\n    this.pageIndex = Math.floor(startIndex / pageSize) || 0;\r\n    this.pageSize = pageSize;\r\n    this._emitPageEvent(previousPageIndex);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\nThis means that when using this page event you cannot do anything BEFORE the loading starts. I'm developing an app that uses rather large tables, and I want to be able to display a loading icon before the table starts updating so the app doesn't just hang. But when I show my loading icon in the (page) event, it only displays AFTER the table has finished updating and hangs for a long time. I've spent many hours trying to find a work around for this and haven't been able to figure anything out. Perhaps there is a reason as to why the line `this._emitPageEvent(previousPageIndex);` is here, but to my very amateurish eyes I feel like this could be solved by moving that line to the top.\r\n\r\nApologies in advance if this post doesn't follow the etiquette, I've not made many of these so I'm still learning. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have a table with a very long dataset\r\n2. Add a paginator\r\n3. Bind the page event on the paginator\r\n4. Have the page event do literally anything, let's say just write some text to the console\r\n5. Change the page size on the paginator from the default 50 to the full table's length\r\n6. Watch the console to see the app will hang until it finishes loading and only THEN do you see the text appear in the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect the page event to be fired first.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe page event is fired after.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25865","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatPaginator): Page event fires too late.\" (#25865)"},{"Id":"1422238279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-26T05:19:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25863","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): unable to click datepicker toggle when form field is disabled","State":"closed","Body":"We support the case where the form field is disabled, but the datepicker isn't.

E.g. if a component contains a mat-icon which allows a ligature of e.g. font-awsome as well as a fonticon which needs another fontSet. Then you would have to check separately in each of these components which icon type is set. Previously this could be overridden by css according to the above mentioned principle.

(ideally some way to identify which template the trackBy was triggered for).\r\n\r\nIn the provided Stackblitz example, it would be expected that when using a typical TrackByFn, that the rows are rendered in the correct position always, instead of occasionally.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe TrackByFn is passed the same arguments for each row template per row.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a typical use case (the provided Stackblitz) the table will misplace the rows under certain conditions, which can be seen by expanding and collapsing the first row a few times, the multiTemplate for the 2nd row will eventually be shown in the first row (video below).\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1449302/197506379-ec6051ea-ebea-47ad-9e20-b59ca7b2aa5e.mov\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25859","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTable): trackBy does not differentiate between multiTemplateDataRows templates\" (#25859)"},{"Id":"1420583144","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-24T10:13:44","Actor":"themos-exelia","Number":"25857","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(google-maps): Add offset (or anchor, or position) option to Marker's label object","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nJust an easy way to offset the label's position, so that it does not overlap with the marker's svg path or png icon.\n\n### Use Case\n\nWhen the map is zoomed out, I would like the marker's Label to not overlap with its (custom) icon","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25857","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(google-maps): Add offset (or anchor, or position) option to Marker's label object\" (#25857)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-10-28T03:30:02.8367432Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1990}

Might be half bug, half feature request.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen updating from angular 12 to 13, the following sequence of events happened:\r\n\r\n1. `ng update` to determine dependencies\r\n2. `ng update ...` \r\n  1. after determining dependencies and updating my package.json file, the script seems to delete node_modules\r\n  2. the `npm install` step triggered by `ng update` fails due to a peer dependency conflict \r\n  3. *this is the FR/bug* this part of the script should do a dry run and abort *before* deleting `node_modules` if the `npm install` with the updated package.json file will fail. Ideally add more details and suggestions here, and roll back the change to `package.json`.\r\n3. Now re-running `ng update` a second time will note no installed dependencies, because apparently the script checks `node_modules` and not `package.json`. \r\n4. The actual fix for the deeper bug is some conflict in peer dependencies between the older 12 installation of architect and build-angular and the updated `package.json` file. Reverting `package.json` to head (the 12 installation), running `npm install` to re-install the now-missing `node_modules` directory, then deleting `package-lock.json`, will allow the `ng update` command to run to completion. If this is a common issue, adding some help text in that regard would be nice.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n*NOTE* this is post-upgrade, the bug happened during a 12->13 upgrade.\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.0.2\r\nNode: 16.10.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 7.24.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                   7.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22162","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng update deletes node_modules before ensuring it will succeed\" (#22162)"},{"Id":"1052408862","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-12T21:08:02","Actor":"artu-ole","Number":"22159","RawContent":null,"Title":"Script imports are modules by default","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

If the event fires before 500ms, we clear the timeout so users don't have to flush it in tests, however we had the following problems:\r\n1. Transparent backdrops don't have a transition so they were always being cleaned up after the 500ms timeout.\r\n2. We weren't clearing the timeout if the overlay was disposed while the backdrop transition is running. This meant that the timeout would still be in memory, even though the element was removed from the DOM.\r\n3. We had a memory leak where the `click` and `transitionend` events weren't being removed from the backdrop if the overlay is disposed while detaching.\r\n\r\nBasically all Material components had one of these issues.

WebGL allows to even write shaders. The theming API unfortunately does not yet support either. It would be great if theming would not just cover colors, but also would allow to write Angular Themes which set a background image (like a rusty metal surface) or even set a background shader (like floating water). That would make Angular applications look much more modern and cool than just setting a color.\n\n### Use Case\n\nCool applications need to be able to use cool themes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(theming): Gradients, Static Background Images and Shaders for Themes\" (#23963)"},{"Id":"1052845036","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-14T04:42:51","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"23962","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(cdk/overlay): add event listeners for overlay dispatchers outside of zone","State":"open","Body":"The `OverlayKeyboardDispatcher` adds a `keydown` event listener, which causes Angular to run change detections on any `keydown` event, tho its listener may behave as a \"noop\" (e.g. if there're no `keydownEvents` observers).\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the Angular zone will be re-entered only if there're any `keydownEvents` listeners.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/23962","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(cdk/overlay): add event listeners for overlay dispatchers outside of zone\" (#23962)"},{"Id":"1052789673","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-13T22:33:01","Actor":"DerYeger","Number":"23961","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(scss): import paths have changed","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv12\n\n### Description\n\nIn v12, I used the following import in SCSS files `@use \"~@angular/material\" as mat;`.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating to Angular v13, only the following import works `@use \"@angular/material\" as mat;`.\r\nHowever, Webstorm does not recognize the import.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

We also use FocusMonitor from the A11yModule of CDK to create accessible keyboard interaction. FocusMonitor has a neat feature - it adds classes specific to the interaction type that the user uses (e.g. on keyboard interaction, the currently focused item has the \".cdk-keyboard-focus\" class).\r\n\r\nWhat I'd suggest as an improvement to the Select component is to have this difference illustrated in the component, out of the box.

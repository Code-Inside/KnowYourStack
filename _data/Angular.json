Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nNo support for fast type declaration emission. Compilation fails with `emitDeclarationOnly` and `noCheck` TS compiler options set because the Angular compiler requires full type-checking information available for compilation.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nIn declaration-only emission mode, the compiler extracts the type declarations (.d.ts) files without full type-checking, which is possible with sufficient type annotations on exports that can be ensured by the `isolatedDeclarations` TS compiler option.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to decouple type declaration emission from the actual full compilation doing the type-checking, thereby removing the edge between dependent TS files in the build action graph. In other words, the compilation of a TS file no longer indirectly depends on the compilation of all the TS files it imports through its dependency on their type declarations, because the type declarations themselves no longer depend on the compilation of their associated TS file.\r\n\r\nWithout the coupling between type declaration emission and compilation, compilation time of a TS project is no longer bound dependent on the depth of the TS dependency tree as we can now build the entire project with just two entirely parallel phases: 1) emit the type declarations of all TS files in parallel and 2) compile all TS files in parallel.\r\n\r\nSince the Angular compiler adds static metadata fields to components, directives, modules, pipes and services based on their respective class annotations, it needs to actively partake in the type declaration emission in order to provide the types for these static fields in the declaration.\r\n\r\nIn this change, we add experimental support for a declaration-only emission mode based on the local compilation mode, which already operates without type-checking and access to external type information, i.e. the same environment as is required for declaration-only emisssion.\r\n\r\nApart from the same restrictions applied in local compilation mode, there are a few more restrictions imposed on code being compatible with this initial and experimental implementation:\r\n\r\n* No support for `@NgModule`s using external references.\r\n* No support for `hostDirectives` in `@Component`s and `@Directive`s using external references.\r\n* No support for `@Input` annotations with `transform`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nInternal references:\r\n* [go/angular:isolated-declarations-for-gemini-web](http://go/angular:isolated-declarations-for-gemini-web)\r\n* [b/416702881](http://b/416702881)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61334","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(compiler-cli): add experimental support for fast type declaration emission\" (#61334)"},{"Id":"3064275066","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T21:04:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"61349","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(zone.js): support vitest patching in zone.js/testing","State":"open","Body":"To support `fakeAsync` usage while using `vitest` as a test runner, Zone.js now provides patching when using the `zone.js/testing` package import.

Each time I need the cache disabled, I have to manually edit angular.json and later revert the change. It'd be great if I could avoid these steps.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHaving a `--no-cache` option for `ng serve` would make this workflow much smoother. It would disable caching only for that specific run, leaving the global configuration untouched.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI can automate this process using the trap command in a shell script, but since trap doesn’t work on Windows, I’d need to maintain a custom script, which complicates things unnecessarily for this simple problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow disabling CLI cache in `ng serve` via command-line flag\" (#30308)"},{"Id":"3063261237","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T14:07:14","Actor":"igord","Number":"30306","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): respect i18nDuplicateTranslation …","State":"open","Body":"…option when duplicates exist\r\n\r\nRunning the extract-i18n command will always log duplicate i18n message IDs as warnings, regardless of the value of the i18nDuplicateTranslation option.

Some of the API requests have infrequently changing data. Pulling the response from cache would save a lot of network time, especially if the response is big.\n\nFlow: \nUser 1 makes makes request to Angular SSR server -> SSR makes requests to API in order to gather data for rendering -> request gets cached -> user 1 receives an html response.\nUser 2 makes request to Angular SSR server -> SSR server would make API request in order to gather data, but instead pulls the response from the cache -> user 2 receives an html response.\n\nOne possible implementation would be to consider Cache-Control header and cache the response in the server for the time specified.\n\nIf this will not be considered - what would you say is the best approach in order to optimize these kind of API requests? Perhaps a wrapper around `global.fetch` in Node server (where Angular engine runs) which would monitor every API request and store in some local cache?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 19 SSR/hybrid rendering engine: cross-request cache\" (#30305)"},{"Id":"3061821911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T13:29:42","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30301","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency terser to v5.39.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.39.0` -> `5.39.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.39.0/5.39.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.39.1`](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5391)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.39.0...v5.39.1)\n\n-   Fix bitwise operations that could mix `BigInt` and `number`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

https://stackblitz.com/edit/jqrnmquv-y12cuztc?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-menu-standalone-menu-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open menu\n2. Press down arrow key - \"Refresh\" menu item is selected\n3. Press down arrow key again - \"Help\" menu item is selected and \"Settings\" is skipped because it is disabled\n4. Press up arrow key - no menu item is selected.\n5. Press up arrow key again - \"Refresh\" menu item is selected\n\nFrom this point on, it takes two button presses to select a menu item before or after the disabled \"Settings\" menu item. This behaviour is even more buggy when the first item in the menu list is disabled.\n\nMat Menu behaviour: https://stackblitz.com/edit/6hkqcjif?file=src%2Fexample%2Fmenu-icons-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open menu\n2. Press down arrow key - \"Disable alerts\" menu item is selected. For some reason, \"Redial\" gets skipped, so there could be another bug here, but it's not the behaviour that I wanted to focus on in this discussion.\n2. Press up arrow key - \"Check voice mail\" is skipped because it is disabled, and \"Redial\" is selected.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would like the disabled menu items to be skipped completely in cdk like they are in mat-menu.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ncdkMenu loses menu item focus when navigating to a disabled menu item\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: ^19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31102","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdkMenu): cdkMenu keyboard navigation doesn't skip disabled options like mat-menu does\" (#31102)"},{"Id":"3059167149","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T14:25:36","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31105","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): floating label triggering callback inside zone","State":"closed","Body":"The floating label has a `setTimeout` inside `_handleResize` which was being called inside the zone from the `floating` setter which can trigger unnecessary change detections.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31105","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/form-field): floating label triggering callback inside zone\" (#31105)"},{"Id":"3060163868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T13:50:51","Actor":"Ben555555","Number":"31107","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDatePicker): NativeDatePicker not using the correct format initially","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I use the following setup:\n\n```\n\nprovideNativeDateAdapter({\n            parse: {\n              dateInput: 'DD.MM.YYYY',\n            },\n            display: {\n              dateInput: 'DD.MM.YYYY',\n              monthYearLabel: 'MMM YYYY',\n              dateA11yLabel: 'LL',\n              monthYearA11yLabel: 'MMMM YYYY',\n            },\n          }),\n{\n            provide: LOCALE_ID,\n            useValue: 'de-CH'\n        },\n```\n\nthe DatePicker will initially show the date in the wrong format: \"13.5.2025\" instead of \"13.05.2025\".

When a component's `theme ` mixin was called, those values were used. This indirection is difficult to follow in the code, making it unclear when values were created and how they are pulled, because the theme files were not actually calling the m3 token files.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmat.define-theme() -> m3-badge.get-tokens($system) -> $theme\r\n...\r\nmat.badge-theme($theme) -> map.get($theme, tokens) -> token-utils.create-token-values($tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change makes the flow very clear: a theme config is created with some system values, and then the token file is directly called from the theme config. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmat.define-theme() -> $theme\r\n...\r\nmat.badge-theme($theme) -> m3-badge.get-tokens($theme) -> token-utils.create-token-values($tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also clears up the mapping with variant colors, which were also inserted in the theme config in an unintuitive way. Instead, we can just perform a simple string replacement, e.g. `secondary` instead of `primary`.\r\n\r\nThe change is performed for badge to show how it will be done with the remaining components. Once that is complete, a lot of cleanup can occur to remove unnecessary flows and mixins.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31099","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove badge component token values from theme\" (#31099)"},{"Id":"3057797523","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-12T18:30:02","Actor":"stasberkov","Number":"31101","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(slider): Introduce token for slider height","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently slider component has hard-coded height of 48px.

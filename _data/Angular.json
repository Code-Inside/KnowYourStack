be better to display `NaN` or `undefined` instead of `∞`? \r\n\r\nWould it be better to throw an error?\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know, but I feel like silently failing by converting `undefined` to `∞`

To my understanding it isn't possible to translate dynamic values at runtime using angular/localize out of the box. Such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// component.ts\r\nwords = ['hello', 'world']\r\n\r\n// component.html\r\n@for (word of words; track word) {\r\n<p i18n=\"@@{{word}}\">\r\n {{word}}\r\n</p>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also tried using the $localize in the ts file such as ```words=[$localize`hello`, $localize`world`]```\r\n\r\nNeither of these is possible in angular/localize due to it being translated at compile time.

This behavior can cause issues, particularly for users employing plugins such as postcss-rtlcss. In Angular 17 and earlier versions, this issue did not occur.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a postcss.config.json file with the postcss-rtlcss plugin configured.\r\n2. Run the Angular application in development mode or build it for production.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\nPostCSS should execute once, correctly applying the postcss-rtlcss plugin and preserving specific CSS comments for RTL processing (e.g., /*!rtl:begin:ignore*/).\r\n\r\n**Observed Behavior:**\r\n\r\nPostCSS runs twice:\r\n\r\n1. The first execution correctly applies the RTL CSS transformations and respects the ignore comments, producing CSS compatible with both LTR and RTL styles.\r\n2. The second execution occurs after the comments have been removed, causing postcss-rtlcss to apply transformations again, leading to unintended CSS changes where comments were intended to prevent modifications.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n\r\nThis issue causes CSS styles to be incorrectly processed, particularly in areas where ignore comments are used to maintain certain styles. The double processing results in unexpected changes to the CSS, breaking the intended styling for both LTR and RTL directions.\r\n\r\n**Request:**\r\n\r\nPlease investigate and resolve the issue of PostCSS running twice in Angular 18+ to ensure consistent and expected CSS processing. This will help maintain compatibility with plugins like postcss-rtlcss and preserve the integrity of the styling configurations.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/oarshad/angular-postcss-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Cli: 18.0.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"postcss in Angular 18+ version running twice\" (#27804)"},{"Id":"2341576353","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-08T10:06:02","Actor":"klerick","Number":"27803","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): Providing a DI token to dev server for SSR","State":"closed","Body":"Add configuration for add custom DI token.\r\n\r\nissue: #26323\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.1\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI have tried to override the esbuild version to the latest version by using the overrides command in package.json.\r\n\r\n\"overrides\": {\r\n     \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": {\r\n           \"esbuild\": \"0.21.4\"\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter this I ran the scan again and yet it did not fix the issue since esbuild version 0.21.4 uses go version of 1.20.12\r\n\r\nIs there version of esbuild used by @angular-devkit/build-angular which solves this issue?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27797","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CVE-2023-45288 vulnerability in esbuild (golang version 1.20.12)\" (#27797)"},{"Id":"2337325229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T00:07:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27790","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/dependency-review-action](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action) | action | patch | `v4.3.2` -> `v4.3.3` |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/verdaccio/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/dependency-review-action (actions/dependency-review-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.3`](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases/tag/v4.3.3): Notes for v4.3.3\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Allow slashes in purl package names by [@&#8203;juxtin](https://togithub.com/juxtin) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765)\n-   use the v3 version of the deps.dev API by [@&#8203;josieang](https://togithub.com/josieang) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741)\n-   PR with suggestions -

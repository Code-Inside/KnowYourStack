This can lead to problems with `src` attributes that load external resources. Browsers consider each change to the `src` attribute as a new request to load the specified resource.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the server returns `<iframe src=\"...\"` pointing to a YouTube video that starts playing after the browser has rendered the content but before `bootstrapApplication` is called, an issue arises. When `bootstrapApplication` is invoked, Angular initiates its 'initialization' flow, during which it calls `setAttribute` on this `iframe` once more. Consequently, the video may flicker as the browser attempts to reload it.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/arturovt/hydration-iframe-src-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.2.7\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.7\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52477","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Static attributes are not hydrated\" (#52477)"},{"Id":"1971378502","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-31T22:19:45","Actor":"atscott","Number":"52476","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use consumer dirtiness to drive whether a view should refresh","State":"open","Body":"First commit is from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52475\r\n\r\n## commit 2:\r\nrefactor(core): Update LView consumer to use only 1 consumer for a component\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the reactive consumer used for `LView`s to be shared\r\nbetween a component and its embedded views.

These signals may be unreliable or (in the case of the proposed input signals) may throw if accessed before the component is first change detected (which is what makes required inputs available).\r\n\r\nDepending on the scenario involved, the effect may or may not run before this initialization takes place, which isn't a great developer experience. In particular, effects created during CD (e.g. via control flow) work fine, as do effects created in bootstrap thanks to the sync CD it performs. When an effect is created through dynamic component creation outside of CD though (such as on router navigations), it runs before the component is first CD'd, causing the issue.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the signal components RFC we described how effects would wait until ngOnInit for their first execution for exactly this reason, but this behavior was never implemented as it was thought our effect scheduling design made it unnecessary. This is true of the regular execution of effects but the above scenario shows that *creation* of the effect is still vulnerable. Thus, this logic is needed.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes effects sensitive to their creation context, by injecting `ChangeDetectorRef` optionally. An effect created with an injector that's tied to a component will wait until that component is initialized before initially being scheduled. TestBed effect flushing is also adjusted to account for the additional interaction with change detection.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52473","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): effects wait for ngOnInit for their first run\" (#52473)"},{"Id":"1969181591","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-31T18:58:26","Actor":"MarkTechson","Number":"52456","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update home page for live stream event","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

On the about-page, I've included the ckeditor.\r\n- In a different project we have built an angular element which should be integratable on any other website (e.g. in vue application stated above)\r\n- Including the angular element within the vue-app (adding a script tag loading the js and adding the tag) does show the element, everything looks fine\r\n\r\nThe issue:\r\n\r\nNavigating from the about-page back to the starpage, does throw an error in the console and breaks the Vue app. I do see the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwidget.js:96697 Unhandled Promise rejection: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data-ck-expando') ; Zone: <root> ; Task: Promise.then ; Value: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data-ck-expando')\r\n    at emittermixin.ts:361:9\r\n    at No (emittermixin.ts:362:1)\r\n    at Ii._getProxyEmitter (emittermixin.ts:152:40)\r\n    at emittermixin.ts:166:27\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Ii._getAllProxyEmitters (emittermixin.ts:166:6)\r\n    at Ii.stopListening (emittermixin.ts:126:32)\r\n    at Ii.destroy (focustracker.ts:106:8)\r\n    at yf.destroy (editorui.ts:179:21)\r\n    at yf.destroy (classiceditorui.ts:117:9) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data-ck-expando')\r\n    at http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3817:22\r\n    at No (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3818:12)\r\n    at Ii._getProxyEmitter (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3776:23)\r\n    at http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3779:180\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Ii._getAllProxyEmitters (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3779:163)\r\n    at Ii.stopListening (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:3766:33)\r\n    at Ii.destroy (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:4385:18)\r\n    at yf.destroy (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:16201:53)\r\n    at yf.destroy (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@ckeditor_ckeditor5-build-classic.js?v=78e69277:16751:19)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nThere are two options to fix the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Remove zone.js completely from the angular element.\r\n2. Add the following line to the widget: `(window as any).__Zone_disable_toString = true;`\r\n\r\nI've attached a repository which does include the vue app mentioned above. It does load our angular element in HomeView.vue. When you start it and then navigate from about to the startpage, you'll see the error. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sschoeb/vue-ckeditor-zone-issue\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 15.2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nQuestion: How big is the impact when disabling toString() using the workaround number 2 described above?

This is also problematic for our translators when the equiv-text blocks do not contain their expected context.\r\n\r\n**Observed Conditions that trigger this problem / Steps to reproduce:** (Check `test-bad.component.html` in the linked project)\r\n1) The html file should have an async pipe in it, like: \r\n```html\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"anyObservable | async\"> </ng-container>\r\n```\r\n2) The item tagged for extraction should contain a variable or nested HTML or both to trigger placeholders in the xlf file.\r\n3) The variable or nested HTML should be the first item in the tagged HTML element and should have no leading whitespace, for example: `<span i18n=\"@@test\"> {{test}} hello</span>` will extract properly, but: `<span i18n=\"@@test\">{{test}} hello</span>` will not have accurate equiv-text in its extraction.\r\n\r\n### Stackblitz link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-1zcqro?file=angular-hello%2Fsrc%2Flocale%2Fmessages.xlf\r\n_cd angular-hello_\r\n_npm i_\r\nTo generate xlf file: _ng extract-i18n angular-hello_\r\nTo run the app: _ng serve --open_\r\n\r\nPlease notice the xlf file linked and compare the `<source>` of trans-units with id `badComponentTitle` and `goodComponentTitle` in the linked stackblitz project. This is one of the more \"colorful\" examples that make our work inconvenient with the unexpected characters it has extracted. The only difference is that `test-bad-component` has an async pipe in its HTML file, while `test-good-component` does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52461","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng extract-i18n bug when file has async pipe.

I can add several lines and it will be ready:\r\n\r\n`angular.json`: `projects.{PROJECT_NAME}.architect.build.options.styles`\r\n```\r\n...............................\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n         {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/default-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/dark-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/system-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n]\r\n...............................\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this will generate 3 separate files in the root directory in the `dist/{PROJECT_NAME}/`. \r\n1. `default-theme.css`\r\n2. `dark-theme.css`\r\n3. `system-theme.css`\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the Style Object has one more additional property: `bundleName` which will help us to change the generated bundle name(which is good). \r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, there is no way to generate these bundles under the sub-directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nSo it will be helpfull to modify the style object, by adding `output` property, that will get the path(`string`) as a value:\r\n\r\n`angular.json`: `projects.{PROJECT_NAME}.architect.build.options.styles`\r\n```\r\n...............................\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n         {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/default-theme.scss\",\r\n                \"output\": \"themes\",\r\n                \"bundleName\": \"default-theme\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/dark-theme.scss\",\r\n                \"output\": \"themes\",\r\n                \"bundleName\": \"dark-theme\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/system-theme.scss\",\r\n                \"output\": \"themes\",\r\n                \"bundleName\": \"system-theme\"\r\n          },\r\n]\r\n...............................\r\n```\r\n\r\nand by these configuration I expect to have, my generated bundles under the `themes` directory\r\n1. `themes/default-theme.css`\r\n2. `themes/dark-theme.css`\r\n3. `themes/system-theme.css`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe second option is to have some standard objects for example:\r\n\r\n`$styles`, `$assets` by which we can have access to the generated styles and assets to manipulate with them in angular.json\r\n\r\nFor example, by using the above example:\r\n\r\n`angular.json`: `projects.{PROJECT_NAME}.architect.build.options.styles`\r\n```\r\n...............................\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n         {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/default-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/dark-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n                \"inject\": false,\r\n                \"input\": \"src/themes/system-theme.scss\",\r\n          },\r\n]\r\n...............................\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use assets object to change the directories:\r\n\r\n`angular.json`: `projects.{PROJECT_NAME}.architect.build.options.assets`\r\n```\r\n...............................\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n         {\r\n                \"input\": \"$styles['default-theme.css']\",\r\n                \"output\": \"themes/default-theme.css\",\r\n                \"glob\": \"compiled\"                 <------------ this is also can be

It seems to me as the right thing to choose, even though the theming documentation currently doesn't mention this function. \r\n\r\nHowever the behavior can be confusing because hues such as `default`, `lighter` or `darker` are added only to the outer map, not the inner contrast map, when calling `define-palette`. Therefore you can only use it with hues that are defined in the contrast-palette from the beginning (such as 500). \r\n\r\nThere is an easy workaround but I also think that it should be fairly easy to add `default`, `lighter`, `darker` etc. to the inner contrast map in `mat.define-palette`. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-egs21k?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

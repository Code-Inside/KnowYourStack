Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the new behaviour?\r\n\r\nHi Angular folks! 👋 \r\n\r\nThis change is a proof of concept of how the new [Chrome DevTools Performance extension API](https://bit.ly/rpp-e11y) can be used to surface Angular runtime data directly in the Chrome DevTools Performance panel.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it implements the following changes:\r\n\r\n### 1. Use the profiling status notification API to toggle the Timing API:\r\n\r\nThe notification API is implemented under the `chrome.devtools.performance` extension namespace and consits of two events: `ProfilingStarted` and `ProfilingStopped`, dispatched when the Performance panel has started and stopped recording, respectively. This API is used to enable the Timings API in Angular when the recording has started in the Performance panel and disable it when recording has stopped. This enables change 2:\r\n\r\n### 2. Use the [User Timings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/User_timing) `detail` field format specification of the Performance extension API  to inject Angular runtime data into the Performance panel timeline. \r\n\r\nThe Angular profiler uses several hooks to measure framework tasks like change detection. With this change, this measurements are visible in the same context as the runtime data collected by the browser in the Performance Panel timeline.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of how this data would look like in the following image:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/25348062/9e9618a0-e332-4e5d-ac54-2a42bfc8d485)\r\n\r\nNote: right now, to enable the user timings to be collected in the first place, one needs to open the Angular DevTools panel before recording with the Chrome Devtools Performance panel so that the related artifacts are loaded in the page. This shortcoming can be fixed in a follow up so that the extra step isn't necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWe (the Chrome Page Quality team) think allowing developers to extend the Peformance Panel can significantly offer a better experience for developers looking to improve performance to the current solutions available (think of fragmented workflows due to context switching between tools). \r\n\r\nWe aim to collect feeback about the API and explore further potential use cases where the API (or an expansion of it) would offer value in the web ecosystem. Doing this in collaboration with the Angular team would be invaluable, so please let us know your thoughts!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55805","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(devtools): Use Chrome DevTools Performance extension API\" (#55805)"},{"Id":"2298197565","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T09:52:34","Actor":"ryan-nis","Number":"55812","RawContent":null,"Title":"No error showing in HTML for invalid Angular IF statement","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nUnsure, only just noticed this being an issue whilst working through someone elses code.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe bug seems to be not highlighting an Angular `if` statement as an error when it contains an `else` reference but no `else` property.\r\n\r\n## Bug Type\r\nWhat does this bug affect\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this bug report using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Angular Language Service VSCode extension\r\n- [ ] Angular Language Service server\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1.

Future further improvements may allow for all cases to use the optimized rebuild execution path.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27642","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(@angular/build): improve rebuild time for file loader usage with prebundling\" (#27642)"},{"Id":"2294029352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T05:06:21","Actor":"CITguy","Number":"27637","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI 16+ generates config that fails to inline stylesheet from typekit/Adobe","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, new\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nv15\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm unable to get an Adobe/typekit CSS stylesheet to embed using an esbuild-based builder configuration.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get it to work with esbuild is to disable font optimization via `projects.PROJECT_NAME.architect.build.configurations.production.optimization.fonts = false` in `angular.json`.  Otherwise, I have to revert back to the `browser` builder.  \r\n\r\nFor now, I'm using the stable `browser` Webpack builder, so that I don't have to muck around with updating configs that may need to be reverted later when we eventually switch to esbuild.  However, the esbuild scripts provide no useful console output or advanced logging to explain _WHY_ it fails, so I have no way to troubleshoot the exact issue.  \r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nGiven that the build script doesn't provide enough detailed information, I can't reliably determine if the issue resides in the build script itself or if it is a result of being behind our corporate firewall/vpn.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, here's how I was able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n1. Generate a fresh Angular 16 or 17 app using angular CLI\r\n    - CLI v16+ seems to default to the `application` build script\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. Check that the production builder is using an esbuild-based script (either `application` or `browser-esbuild`)\r\n4. add an Adobe/typekit css import to your `src/styles.scss`\r\n5. `npm run build`\r\n\r\nFYI: This seems to only be an issue with builders using esbuild. The webpack-based `browser` script still works fine, but doesn't actually inline the CSS file; it just passes through the CSS `@import`, verbatim.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n![Failed to inline external stylesheet](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/545605/d5bd62fc-fea8-45d5-966e-cf873e07a393)\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ npm run build -- --verbose\r\n\r\n> ngapp17@0.0.0 build\r\n> ng build --verbose\r\n\r\n⠋ Building...\r\n\r\n  polyfills-S3BTP7ME.js  33.2kb\r\n\r\n⠏ Building...\r\n\r\n  main-LRVPNULS.js  193.2kb\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation failed.

Here's an example of a decorator that doesn't work without this change:\n\n    ```js\n    const dec = () => function() { this.bar = true }\n    class Foo { @&#8203;dec static foo }\n    console.log(Foo.bar) // Should be \"true\"\n    ```\n\n-   Allow `es2023` as a target environment ([#&#8203;3762](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3762))\n\n    TypeScript recently [added `es2023`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58140) as a compilation target, so esbuild now supports this too. There is no difference between a target of `es2022` and `es2023` as far as esbuild is concerned since the 2023 edition of JavaScript doesn't introduce any new syntax

this)\n\nℹ️ Important changes added to the `.verdaccio-db.json` and token signature for users that run on Node.js 22 or higher (in the future 🙃 ) please read\nhttps://verdaccio.org/docs/configuration/#.verdaccio-db\n\nTLDR:\n\n-   Enforced for users that runs verdaccio **via npmjs**, for all Docker image isuers, verdaccio uses Node.js LTS 21 and the secret migration is **voluntary** until next major release.\n-   For **Node.js 21** or lower a new *deprecation* will appear `  [VERWAR007] VerdaccioDeprecation: the secret length is too lon... ` to remove it please read the link above\n-   For **Node.js 22** if you have already a storage with `.verdaccio-db.json` and the token inside does not complies with the length (read link above) **the application startup will fail with fatal error (`Error: Invalid storage secret key length, must be 32 characters long but is....`)**\n\nIn both cases by updating the *secret* all previously tokens will get invalid, in your benefit a new legacy signature will be applied and is more secure than the old one (generating tokens with salt).\n\nFor existing installations that have no issues by invalidating tokens is recommended to add to the `config.yaml` the following setup, this will automatically generate a new the secret once is started, could be removed aftewards, if all went succesfull the `[VERWAR007]` deprecation will not be displayed anymore.\n\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n  api:\n    migrateToSecureLegacySignature: true\n```\n\nAny new installation should not worry about this, new token signature and secret (32 characters) is applied by default.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add property forceMigrateToSecureLegacySignature

Note the SecondRoutes enum, it's also part of the problem.\r\n\r\nsecond.component.ts\r\n```ts\r\nexport class SecondComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private _router: Router,\r\n  ) {}\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    // Causes Bug\r\n    //console.log(this._route.snapshot.paramMap.get(SecondRoutes.CodeParam));\r\n    // Causes Bug too\r\n    //this._router.navigate(['/', SecondRoutes.Module]);\r\n    // Using ThirdRoutes works again\r\n    this._router.navigate(['/', ThirdRoutes.Module]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis works fine too. Note `ThirdRoutes.Module` which is an enum from a different module.\r\n\r\nsecond.component.ts\r\n```ts\r\nexport class SecondComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private _router: Router,\r\n  ) {}\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    // Causes Bug\r\n    console.log(this._route.snapshot.paramMap.get(SecondRoutes.CodeParam));\r\n    // Causes Bug too\r\n    this._router.navigate(['/', SecondRoutes.Module]);\r\n    // Using ThirdRoutes works again\r\n    //this._router.navigate(['/', ThirdRoutes.Module]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis causes the bug.

At the same time, any allowlist or source expressions such as 'self' or 'unsafe-inline' will be ignored.\r\n\r\nBased on that documentation I would expect both cases to work. For the esbuild case, we are allowing `main.js` via sha384, which should then be allowed to import further scripts.

On the variant that I took as a basis, there is the enter method, which was cut out in new versions of the material and advised to use: _dropListRef, but as a result, when I uncomment the lines in my version from 160 to 162, I get an error about exceeding the call stack, if left commented out, sorting begins to work from the second move, after the first dragging, the element returns to its place. And under any conditions, for some reason, the rearrangement of blocks begins to work after the second tug-of-war.\r\n2. And the second error, if you leave the current option, it begins to work out as described above after we start moving the cell for the second time, and it works only smoothly until the next cell, after the visual starts to glitch and a lot of errors come from ClientRect, although the logic works and the cell will stand where it is translucent, but visually it stops moving.\r\nIf possible, please tell me what the problem might be and how it can be fixed, or maybe you have better examples of how to implement it so that it looks like the first example? Thank you very much in advance.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n I did drag&drop based on the code from this page:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dragdrop-grid?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nAnd that's what happened:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5mctqa?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations%2C%20@angular/common%2C%20@angular/compiler%2C%20@angular/core%2C%20@angular/forms%2C%20@angular/platform-browser%2C%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic%2C%20@angular/router%2C%20core-js%2C%20rxjs%2C%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fapp%2Fdashboard%2Fdashboard.component.html&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI need to implement drag and drop very similar to the first option.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe elements do not shift after the first drag, there are also a lot of errors in the ClientRect console when dragging to a cell or very often through a cell. There is no error on ClientRect if we dragged the cell, then moved it again on the spot and dropped it. And we start moving one cell at a time, the error sometimes goes away. But after 1 cell it always appears immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.3.1\r\n- CDK/Material 17.3.1:\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chorme\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):

This will cause automatic [application synchronization](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4231e8f28ffe8f55dddc2af0647b5b04fa8445d7/packages/core/src/change_detection/scheduling/ng_zone_scheduling.ts#L48-L58) before the tester has a chance to fully initialize the component (i.e. set inputs, run change detection before `afterNextRender` hooks run if they're defined in constructors, etc.). \r\n\r\nOne workaround that developers can use today is to wrap all of their setup logic in an `NgZone.run` of their own, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fixture = TestBed.inject(NgZone).run(() => {\r\n  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComp);\r\n  fixture.componentRef.setInput('requiredInput', 'initialValue');\r\n  return fixture;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57313\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57767\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57856\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57858","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Canonical: Components cannot be fully initialized before `ApplicationRef.tick` with ZoneJS and `TestBed.createComponent`\" (#57858)"},{"Id":"2531392695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T14:57:07","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"57857","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57857","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies\" (#57857)"},{"Id":"2531366788","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T14:46:48","Actor":"devversion","Number":"57855","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: do not run renovate on signal migration TS versioning tests","State":"open","Body":"The versions for TypeScript should not be updated, as we explicitly test against older versions of TS.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57855","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: do not run renovate on signal migration TS versioning tests\" (#57855)"},{"Id":"2531362118","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T14:44:51","Actor":"devversion","Number":"57854","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): check inheritance in signal queries migration","State":"open","Body":"Notably the inheritance checking is less complete as the one in the input migration. That is because we can't efficiently determine query fields in the analyze phase of compilation units. Unless we aggresively consider every field of decorated classes as queries and complexify the merged metadata significantly, we can't reliably check for cases where a class is incompatible for migration because it overrides a member from a class that is in a different compilation unit.\r\n\r\nThis is an acceptable limitation though (maybe for now), as worst case, we would migrate the class and the other compilation unit would simply break. Not ideal, but migrations are impossible to be 100% correct in general— so not a surprise.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we may find ways to identify queries more reliably in analyze phase already. e.g. if the compiler were to include this metadata in the `.d.ts`, or if we decide to simply add this to the metadata, accepting potential significant HDD increase.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57854","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(migrations): check inheritance in signal queries migration\" (#57854)"},{"Id":"2531348242","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T14:38:58","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"57853","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update pullapprove config to enact changes for renovate","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57853","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: update pullapprove config to enact changes for renovate\" (#57853)"},{"Id":"2531198051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T14:12:40","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"57852","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57852","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies\" (#57852)"},{"Id":"2530008288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T13:48:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"57843","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.26.7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.26.6` -> `v3.26.7` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.26.7`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.6...v3.26.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.6...v3.26.7)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I don't believe this reasoning makes any sense when it comes to directives because it's literally impossible to maintain anyway and even if it was — it's a terrible practice to rely on `<div dirA dirB>` behaving differently than `<div dirB dirA>`.\r\n\r\nConsider this situation:\r\nAll my `buttons` have a host directive that applies some visual rules — `appearance`.\r\nAll my `dropdown items` have the same host directive.\r\n\r\nNow imagine I have an element, say a `sidebar item`, that can be both a `dropdown item` and a `button` and needs some code from both of those directives. If I add both `button` and `dropdown item` to host directives of `sidebar item` I get `appearance` double matched.\r\n\r\nCollapsed sidebar shows items in dropdown:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d5898e4-02af-41df-8172-10b01ceaa6fa)\r\n\r\nExpanded sidebar shows them outside of dropdown as regular buttons:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac3c86f-62d5-4831-98ae-dca5327b85ff)\r\n\r\nI tried to make this example as simple and transparent as possible to illustrate the issue, please do not take it at face value. In reality this cases are much more complex, but they boil down to this:\r\n\r\n**We need to be able to declare host directives freely without having to worry about combining our directives further down the line and finding out some particular combinations cause errors due to nested host directives structure.**\r\n\r\nThere's an added complexity here because host directive declarations can expose different inputs/outputs, so the real discussion here should be how to handle those best. But the core idea that it shouldn't throw for multiple matches is absolutely clear, unless I'm missing something which I'm sure I'm not but if you have a good reasoning for it — please bring it up.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nOnce a directive is already matched on an element, ignore all subsequent matches like providers do when they are seen multiple times in `providers` arrays of multiple directives on the same element.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone possible","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57846","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`hostDirectives` should auto-resolve double matching\" (#57846)"},{"Id":"2529816793","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T07:50:20","Actor":"DevJaGz","Number":"57841","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested Signal is not rendered in the view","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore, zone.js\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nBased on the following signal structure, the message is not rendered in the view after the signal is updated, why?:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface State {\r\n  conversation: WritableSignal<Conversation | null>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Conversation {\r\n  title: string;\r\n  messages: {\r\n    [messageId: string]: WritableSignal<Message>;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Message {\r\n  content: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Component class\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [JsonPipe],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h1>Conversation:</h1>\r\n    <pre>{{conversation() | json}}</pre>\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <h1>Messages in conversation:</h1>\r\n    <pre>{{messages() | json}}</pre>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App implements OnInit {\r\n  name = 'Angular';\r\n  state: State = {\r\n    conversation: signal(null),\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  conversation = computed(() => this.state.conversation());\r\n  messages = computed(() => this.conversation()?.messages);\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      console.log('Trigged By First Time!');\r\n      this.state.conversation.set({\r\n        title: 'Trigged By First Time!',\r\n        messages: {},\r\n      });\r\n      console.log('Messages:', this.conversation()?.messages);\r\n    }, 4_000);\r\n\r\n    // Why the \"first\" property is not displayed in the view?? - as you can see in the console.log it is printed\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      console.log('Trigged By Second Time!');\r\n      this.state.conversation.set({\r\n        title: 'Trigged By Second Time!',\r\n        messages: {\r\n          first: signal({\r\n            content: 'This is a message',\r\n          }),\r\n        },\r\n      });\r\n      console.log('Messages:', this.conversation()?.messages);\r\n    }, 8_000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-aygixr?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n{}\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.7\r\nNode: 20.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nShould be render at something like: `{ first: ...}`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57841","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested Signal is not rendered in the view\" (#57841)"},{"Id":"2530324339","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-17T07:47:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"57845","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): extended diagnostics not validating ICUs","State":"open","Body":"The visitor that all extended diagnostics are based on hadn't implemented the `visitIcu` method which meant that it wasn't detecting any code inside of them.\r\n\r\nFixes #57838.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57845","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): extended diagnostics not validating ICUs\" (#57845)"},{"Id":"2529569565","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T21:58:48","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"57840","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): Add a `kind` field to the parsed AST","State":"open","Body":"The Aspirin team wants to use the output of `parseTemplate` in order to build some g3-internal tooling.

Example config below for references as I cannot post details from our work setup. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"your-project-name\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"sourceMap\": {\r\n              \"scripts\": true,\r\n              \"vendor\": true\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when running ng serve with a production config the source maps for things like RX are debuggable without issue.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nng serve application --open live-reload --configuration=production\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when we run our release jobs using this command we find the disted app does not support loading source maps from node_modules. All other source maps seem to work fine .\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build application --configuration=production\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked for a documented change here to see if vendor source maps are still supported in production builds and couldn't find anything about them being deprecated.  \r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide

**Breaking change**: Passing a number with unit `%` to the `$alpha` parameter\n    of `color.change()`, `color.adjust()`, `change-color()`, and `adjust-color()`\n    is now interpreted as a percentage, instead of ignoring the unit. For example,\n    `color.change(red, $alpha: 50%)` now returns `rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5)`.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking compatibility fix**: Sass no longer rounds RGB channels\n    to the nearest integer. This means that, for example, `rgb(0 0 1) != rgb(0 0\n    0.6)`. This matches the latest version of the CSS spec and browser behavior.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking compatibility fix**: Passing large positive or negative\n    values to `color.adjust()` can now cause a color's channels to go outside that\n    color's gamut. In most cases this will currently be clipped by the browser and\n    end up showing the same color as before, but once browsers implement gamut\n    mapping it may produce a different result.\n\n-   Add support for CSS Color Level 4 [color spaces]. Each color value now tracks\n    its color space along with the values of each channel in that color space.\n    There are two general principles to keep in mind when dealing with new color\n    spaces:\n\n    1.  With the exception of legacy color spaces (`rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb`), colors\n        will always be emitted in the color space they were defined in unless\n        they're explicitly converted.\n\n    2.  The `color.to-space()` function is the only way to convert a color to\n        another color space. Some built-in functions may do operations in a\n        different color space, but they'll always convert back to the original space\n        afterwards.\n\n-   `rgb` colors can now have non-integer channels and channels outside the normal\n    gamut of 0-255. These colors are always emitted using the `rgb()` syntax so\n    that modern browsers that are being displayed on wide-gamut devices can\n    display the most accurate color possible.\n\n-   Add support for all the new color syntax defined in Color Level 4, including:\n\n    -   `oklab()`, `oklch()`, `lab()`, and `lch()` functions;\n    -   a top-level `hwb()` function that matches the space-separated CSS syntax;\n    -   and a `color()` function that supports the `srgb`, `srgb-linear`,\n        `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`, `prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `xyz`, `xyz-d50`, and\n        `xyz-d65` color spaces.\n\n-   Add new functions for working with color spaces:\n\n    -   `color.to-space($color, $space)` converts `$color` to the given `$space`. In\n        most cases this conversion is lossless—the color may end up out-of-gamut for\n        the destination color space, but browsers will generally display it as best\n        they can regardless. However, the `hsl` and `hwb` spaces can't represent\n        out-of-gamut colors and so will be clamped.\n\n    -   `color.channel($color, $channel, $space: null)` returns the value of the\n        given `$channel` in `$color`, after converting it to `$space` if necessary.\n        It should be used instead of the old channel-specific functions such as\n        `color.red()` and `color.hue()`.\n\n    -   `color.same($color1, $color2)` returns whether two colors represent the same\n        color even across color spaces. It differs from `$color1 == $color2` because\n        `==` never consider colors in different (non-legacy) spaces as equal.\n\n    -   `color.is-in-gamut($color, $space: null)` returns whether `$color` is\n        in-gamut for its color space (or `$space` if it's passed).\n\n    -   `color.to-gamut($color, $space: null)` returns `$color` constrained to its\n        space's gamut (or to `$space`'s gamut, if passed). This is generally not\n        recommended since even older browsers will display out-of-gamut colors as\n        best they can, but it may be necessary in some cases.\n\n    -   `color.space($color)`: Returns the name of `$color`'s color space.\n\n    -   `color.is-legacy($color)`: Returns whether `$color` is in a legacy color\n        space (`rgb`, `hsl`, or `hwb`).\n\n    -   `color.is-powerless($color, $channel, $space: null)`: Returns whether the\n        given `$channel` of `$color` is powerless in `$space` (or its own color\n        space). A channel is \"powerless\" if its value doesn't affect the way the\n        color is displayed, such as hue for a color with 0 chroma.\n\n    -   `color.is-missing($color, $channel)`: Returns whether `$channel`'s value is\n        missing in `$color`. Missing channels can be explicitly specified using the\n        special value `none` and can appear automatically when `color.to-space()`\n        returns a color with a powerless channel. Missing channels are usually\n        treated as 0, except when interpolating between two colors and in\n        `color.mix()` where they're treated as the same value as the other color.\n\n-   Update existing functions to support color spaces:\n\n    -   `hsl()` and `color.hwb()` no longer forbid out-of-bounds values. Instead,\n        they follow the CSS spec by clamping them to within the allowed range.\n\n    -   `color.change()`, `color.adjust()`, and `color.scale()` now support all\n        channels of all color spaces. However, if you want to modify a channel\n        that's not in `$color`'s own color space, you have to explicitly specify the\n        space with the `$space` parameter. (For backwards-compatibility, this\n        doesn't apply to legacy channels of legacy colors—for example, you can still\n        adjust an `rgb` color's saturation without passing `$space: hsl`).\n\n    -   `color.mix()` and `color.invert()` now support the standard CSS algorithm\n        for interpolating between two colors (the same one that's used for gradients\n        and animations). To use this, pass the color space to use for interpolation\n        to the `$method` parameter. For polar color spaces like `hsl` and `oklch`,\n        this parameter also allows you to specify how hue interpolation is handled.\n\n    -   `color.complement()` now supports a `$space` parameter that indicates which\n        color space should be used to take the complement.\n\n    -   `color.grayscale()` now operates in the `oklch` space for non-legacy colors.\n\n    -   `color.ie-hex-str()` now automatically converts its color to the `rgb` space\n        and gamut-maps it so that it can continue to take colors from any color\n        space.\n\n[color spaces]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value\n\n-   The following functions are now deprecated, and uses should be replaced with\n    the new color-space-aware functions defined above:\n\n    -   The `color.red()`, `color.green()`, `color.blue()`, `color.hue()`,\n        `color.saturation()`, `color.lightness()`, `color.whiteness()`, and\n        `color.blackness()` functions, as well as their global counterparts, should\n        be replaced with calls to `color.channel()`.\n\n    -   The global `adjust-hue()`, `saturate()`, `desaturate()`, `lighten()`,\n        `darken()`, `transaprentize()`, `fade-out()`, `opacify()`, and `fade-in()`\n        functions should be replaced by `color.adjust()` or `color.scale()`.\n\n-   Add a `global-builtin` future deprecation, which can be opted-into with the\n    `--future-deprecation` flag or the `futureDeprecations` option in the JS or\n    Dart API. This emits warnings when any global built-in functions that are\n    now available in `sass:` modules are called. It will become active by default\n    in an upcoming release alongside the `@import` deprecation.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Added a `ColorSpace` class which represents the various color spaces defined\n    in the CSS spec.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.space` which returns a color's color space.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.channels` and `.channelsOrNull` which returns a list\n    of channel values, with missing channels converted to 0 or exposed as null,\n    respectively.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.isLegacy`, `.isInGamut`, `.channel()`, `.isChannelMissing()`,\n    `.isChannelPowerless()`, `.toSpace()`, `.toGamut()`, `.changeChannels()`, and\n    `.interpolate()` which do the same thing as the Sass functions of the\n    corresponding names.\n\n-   `SassColor.rgb()` now allows out-of-bounds and non-integer arguments.\n\n-   `SassColor.hsl()` and `.hwb()` now allow out-of-bounds arguments.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.hwb()`, `.srgb()`, `.srgbLinear()`, `.displayP3()`,\n    `.a98Rgb()`, `.prophotoRgb()`, `.rec2020()`, `.xyzD50()`, `.xyzD65()`,\n    `.lab()`, `.lch()`, `.oklab()`, `.oklch()`, and `.forSpace()` constructors.\n\n-   Deprecated `SassColor.red`, `.green`, `.blue`, `.hue`, `.saturation`,\n    `.lightness`, `.whiteness`, and `.blackness` in favor of\n    `SassColor.channel()`.\n\n-   Deprecated `SassColor.changeRgb()`, `.changeHsl()`, and `.changeHwb()` in\n    favor of `SassColor.changeChannels()`.\n\n-   Added `SassNumber.convertValueToUnit()` as a shorthand for\n    `SassNumber.convertValue()` with a single numerator.\n\n-   Added `InterpolationMethod` and `HueInterpolationMethod` which collectively\n    represent the method to use to interpolate two colors.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   While the legacy API has been deprecated since we released the modern API, we\n    now emit warnings when the legacy API is used to make sure users are aware\n    that it will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.

From our observations, it can start already from +/- 500 child nodes.\r\nIt does not need to be deeply nested, just 1 level deep is enough, but the amount of child nodes matters.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce it with flat `cdk-tree-node`, only when using the `cdk-nested-tree-node`. Even then, it only seems to happen when loading children dynamically plus timing (network delay) also seems to play a role. \r\n\r\nThe errors look like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d672f77-7264-4523-a140-20283e9f59ea)\r\n\r\nNOTE: it can also be reproduced using the `treeControl` instead of `childrenAccessor` (like we would write it before v18.2.0). That makes no difference.

However, this token appears to be missing in the latest version 18.2.3.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nVersion Affected: Angular Material 18.2.3\r\nImpact: The absence of the word-break token affects how text overflow is handled in tooltips, potentially leading to layout issues or text being cut off incorrectly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to modify certain properties of tooltips, such as word-break or max-width. Even when applying a custom class using matTooltipClass, the class is applied to the parent element, whereas these properties need to be applied to the element that actually contains the text to achieve the desired effects.\r\n\r\nBelow is the structure of the tooltip rendered in HTML:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1684272-a79c-4b66-9c82-2dea8d80ffce)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.

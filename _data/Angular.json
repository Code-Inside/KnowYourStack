This allows the bundler to locate and process any resource files such as images or fonts used within the stylesheet.\r\nThe implementation of the rebasing functionality uses a series of custom Sass importers to transform the input stylesheets (from import or use rules) when they are loaded from the file system. However, for the Sass compiler to use the load functionality of an importer, the `canonicalize` function (used to resolve an import) of the same importer must return a resolved path to the requested stylesheet. To support this requirement, all stylesheet resolution has been implemented in three new importers: relative, module, and load path. An additional benefit of these resolvers is that they have been implemented to minimize the volume of filesystem calls and also cache directory entry information (currently per request) to further reduce file system access. The reduction in filesystem calls provides a small performance benefit for projects containing a large amount of Sass file imports.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24185","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): rebase Sass url() values when using esbuild-based builder\" (#24185)"},{"Id":"1433080984","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-04T18:07:27","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24169","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency npm-package-arg to v10","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24169","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dependency npm-package-arg to v10\" (#24169)"},{"Id":"1435196673","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-04T18:07:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"24181","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): account for package.json exports with Sass in esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"When using the experimental esbuild-based browser application builder, Sass module imports will now resolve using esbuild's resolve methods.

It looks like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    const value = { foo: 1, bar: false } satisfies Record<string, number | boolean>\n    console.log(value.foo.toFixed(1)) // TypeScript knows that \"foo\" is a number here\n    ```\n\n    Before this existed, you could use a cast with `as` to check that a value satisfies a less specific type, but that removes any additional knowledge that TypeScript has about that specific value:\n\n    ```ts\n    const value = { foo: 1, bar: false } as Record<string, number | boolean>\n    console.log(value.foo.toFixed(1)) // TypeScript no longer knows that \"foo\" is a number\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about this feature in [TypeScript's blog post for 4.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9-rc/#the-satisfies-operator) as well as [the associated TypeScript issue for this feature](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/47920).\n\n    This feature was implemented in esbuild by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Fix watch mode constantly rebuilding if the parent directory is inaccessible ([#&#8203;2640](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2640))\n\n    Android is unusual in that it has an inaccessible directory in the path to the root, which esbuild was not originally built to handle. To handle cases like this, the path resolution layer in esbuild has a hack where it treats inaccessible directories as empty. However, esbuild's watch implementation currently triggers a rebuild if a directory previously encountered an error but the directory now exists. The assumption is that the previous error was caused by the directory not existing. Although that's usually the case, it's not the case for this particular parent directory on Android. Instead the error is that the directory previously existed but was inaccessible.\n\n    This discrepancy between esbuild's path resolution layer and its watch mode was causing watch mode to rebuild continuously on Android. With this release, esbuild's watch mode instead checks for an error status change in the `readdir` file system call, so watch mode should no longer rebuild continuously on Android.\n\n-   Apply a fix for a rare deadlock with the JavaScript API ([#&#8203;1842](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1842), [#&#8203;2485](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2485))\n\n    There have been reports of esbuild sometimes exiting with an \"all goroutines are asleep\" deadlock message from the Go language runtime. This issue hasn't made much progress until recently, where a possible cause was discovered (thanks to [@&#8203;jfirebaugh](https://togithub.com/jfirebaugh) for the investigation). This release contains a possible fix for that possible cause, so this deadlock may have been fixed. The fix cannot be easily verified because the deadlock is non-deterministic and rare. If this was indeed the cause, then this issue only affected the JavaScript API in situations where esbuild was already in the process of exiting.\n\n    In detail: The underlying cause is that Go's [`sync.WaitGroup`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#WaitGroup) API for waiting for a set of goroutines to finish is not fully thread-safe. Specifically it's not safe to call `Add()` concurrently with `Wait()` when the wait group counter is zero due to a data race. This situation could come up with esbuild's JavaScript API when the host JavaScript process closes the child process's stdin and the child process (with no active tasks) calls `Wait()` to check that there are no active tasks, at the same time as esbuild's watchdog timer calls `Add()` to add an active task (that pings the host to see if it's still there). The fix in this release is to avoid calling `Add()` once we learn that stdin has been closed but before we call `Wait()`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.27.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.27.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/823b018b1c4e3e7979c06d7628d769ed9efc926a...e9509642f6e6c2692565d2a42ecd98c7c41e48b1)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`f14587c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f14587c42bb0fe6ec89529aede045a488083d6ee) feat: new `no-new-native-nonconstructor` rule ([#&#8203;16368](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16368)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n-   [`978799b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/978799bd5c76fecf4ce8f17d89ad6c9f436c3228) feat: add new rule `no-empty-static-block` ([#&#8203;16325](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16325)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n-   [`69216ee`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/69216ee69c7172e847b64e0e934b5121a34d0ea3) feat: no-empty suggest to add comment in empty BlockStatement ([#&#8203;16470](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16470)) (Nitin Kumar)\n-   [`319f0a5`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/319f0a5491598825bbd528c6d1fc12771056a74c) feat: use `context.languageOptions.ecmaVersion` in core rules ([#&#8203;16458](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16458)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`c3ce521`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/c3ce5212f672d95dde3465d7d3c4bf99ff665f8b) fix: Ensure unmatched glob patterns throw an error ([#&#8203;16462](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16462)) (Nicholas C.

The problem is that the naming is also used in the class names generated by `typography-hierarchy`. These changes aim to avoid breakages by:\r\n1. Introducing a `legacy-typography-hierarchy` mixin that keeps the old behavior.\r\n2. Migrating users to the legacy mixin in `ng update`.\r\n3. Migrating users to the new version in `ng generate`. \r\n4. Renaming all usages of the legacy classes in templates and Sass files to the new ones.\r\n\r\nIn the process of writing the migration for the legacy typography, I found an issue where as a side-effect of PostCSS's behavior to re-run processors whenever an AST is mutated, we were applying the same migrations multiple times. This hadn't shown up until now, because all the migrations are independent, but in the `typography-hierarchy` we have a case where some legacy and non-legacy classes are being swapped. This led to wrong output and was causing the integration tests to time out. I've resolved the issue by:\r\n1. Wrapping these conflicting classes in a special value so that they aren't migrated incorrectly on the first pass. The special value is removed at the end of the migration.\r\n2. Adding some code in the `StyleMigrator` to avoid processing the same AST node with the same migration more than once.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've also included a couple of additional commits to fix the typography demo in the dev app and to reorganize a few schematic tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25929","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Handle typography hierarchy in MDC migration\" (#25929)"},{"Id":"1434346301","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-04T16:02:57","Actor":"Ulse81","Number":"25918","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/tabs): Reference error at unit tests with rc-version","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14.2.0\n\n### Description\n\nWe switched to the newest release candidate of angular and angular material.

I've used this mechanism in the past, to create wrapper components around scrollable content, regardless of the concrete implementation.\r\n\r\nBut with #24394, the provider declaration of `CdkVirtualScrollViewport` changed and unless I'm missing something, is now broken: it expects a provider for `CdkVirtualScrollable`, which the factory claims can be null, but isn't declared as an optional dependency for the provider factory. At the same time, `CdkVirtualScrollable` isn't really the correct injection token: as far as I see, it's provided via a new `VIRTUAL_SCROLLABLE` token (as seen in the new `CdkVirtualScrollableElement` directive)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: CdkScrollable,\r\n      useFactory: (\r\n        virtualScrollable: CdkVirtualScrollable | null,\r\n        viewport: CdkVirtualScrollViewport,\r\n      ) => virtualScrollable || viewport,\r\n      deps: [CdkVirtualScrollable, CdkVirtualScrollViewport],\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nexport class CdkVirtualScrollViewport extends CdkVirtualScrollable implements OnInit, OnDestroy\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the dependency for the provider factory needs to be changed to \r\n```\r\ndeps: [[new Optional(), new Inject(VIRTUAL_SCROLLABLE)], CdkVirtualScrollViewport],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-3hbcp2?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n2.

Using the example from the minimal reproduction repository:\r\n```ts\r\n...\r\nimport * as x from 'my-lib-a';\r\n\r\n// TODO: This is required for `spyOn` to work using zone.js 0.13.1+\r\njest.mock('my-lib-a');\r\n\r\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n  it(`should have as title 'my-app-a'`, () => {\r\n    jest.spyOn(x, 'getNumber').mockReturnValue(2);\r\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);\r\n    const app = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    expect(app.title).toEqual(2);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\nHowever, we're unsure if this is a reliable workaround.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/abaran30/nx-angular-playground/tree/zone.js-0.13.1-spyOn\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nFAIL   my-app-a  apps/my-app-a/src/app/app.component.spec.ts\r\n  AppComponent\r\n    ‚úì should create the app (71 ms)\r\n    ‚úï should have as title 'my-app-a' (1 ms)\r\n    ‚úì should render title (11 ms)\r\n\r\n  ‚óè AppComponent ‚Ä∫ should have as title 'my-app-a'\r\n\r\n    TypeError: Cannot redefine property: getNumber\r\n        at Function.defineProperty (<anonymous>)\r\n\r\n      21 |\r\n      22 |   it(`should have as title 'my-app-a'`, () => {\r\n    > 23 |     jest.spyOn(x, 'getNumber').mockReturnValue(2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.1\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.1\r\nng-packagr                      17.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

He fixed this by appending level information to the generated alias name.\r\n\r\nTemplate Pipeline actually suffered from the same bug. We fix it in a very similar way -- in particular, whenever these derived context variables are used, we make them depend on versions of `$index` and `$count` that have been suffixed with the xref of the enclosing repeater.\r\n\r\nI have added a few more pipeline goldens, because we are not quite as clever as TDB about only generating the duplicate suffixed index and count variables when inside nested loops.

However, as applications grow in complexity, developers often face challenges in optimizing performance, particularly in areas like rendering, change detection, and data binding. Presently, there's a lack of intuitive, Angular-specific tools for monitoring and visualizing these performance aspects, making it difficult to pinpoint inefficiencies and bottlenecks.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose the development of an integrated performance monitoring suite within Angular's ecosystem. This suite would offer real-time insights and visualizations about the application's performance directly within the development environment. Key features of this suite could include:\r\n\r\n- Component Rendering Analysis: Visual tools to track and display rendering times for each component, helping identify components that cause significant delays.\r\n- Change Detection Profiling: Monitoring tools to observe and report the frequency and duration of change detection cycles, highlighting inefficient patterns or unnecessary triggers.\r\n- Optimization Recommendations: Automated suggestions for performance improvements, such as implementing lazy loading, optimizing data binding strategies, or leveraging Angular's OnPush change detection.\r\n- Customizable Dashboard: A configurable interface allowing developers to focus on metrics most relevant to their specific application.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Third-Party Performance Tools: While external tools offer some insights, they often lack the deep integration and understanding of Angular's inner workings necessary for detailed analysis and specific optimization recommendations.\r\n- Manual Performance Debugging: Developers can manually profile applications using existing browser tools. However, this process is often time-consuming and requires in-depth knowledge of Angular's framework internals.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53661","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Integrate Advanced Performance Monitoring Tools for Angular Applications\" (#53661)"},{"Id":"2051074673","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-20T18:29:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"53660","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): Update even emit in mock to reflect type","State":"open","Body":"The `MockPlatformLocation` includes properties that do not exist on the public type of `LocationChangeEvent`.

The problem happened because esbuild's TypeScript transformation removes unused imports (which is required for correctness, as they may be type-only imports) and esbuild's glob import transformation wasn't correctly marking the imported helper function as used. This wasn't caught earlier because most of esbuild's glob import tests were written in JavaScript, not in TypeScript.\n\n-   Fix `require()` glob imports with bundling disabled ([#&#8203;3546](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3546))\n\n    Previously `require()` calls containing glob imports were incorrectly transformed when bundling was disabled. All glob imports should only be transformed when bundling is enabled. This bug has been fixed.\n\n-   Fix a panic when transforming optional chaining with `define` ([#&#8203;3551](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3551), [#&#8203;3554](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3554))\n\n    This release fixes a case where esbuild could crash with a panic, which was triggered by using `define` to replace an expression containing an optional chain. Here is an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(process?.env.SHELL)\n\n    // Old output (with --define:process.env={})\n    /* panic: Internal error (while parsing \"<stdin>\") */\n\n    // New output (with --define:process.env={})\n    var define_process_env_default = {};\n    console.log(define_process_env_default.SHELL);\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;hi-ogawa](https://togithub.com/hi-ogawa).\n\n-   Work around a bug in node's CommonJS export name detector ([#&#8203;3544](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3544))\n\n    The export names of a CommonJS module are dynamically-determined at run time because CommonJS exports are properties on a mutable object. But the export names of an ES module are statically-determined at module instantiation time by using `import` and `export` syntax and cannot be changed at run time.\n\n    When you import a CommonJS module into an ES module in node, node scans over the source code to attempt to detect the set of export names that the CommonJS module will end up using. That statically-determined set of names is used as the set of names that the ES module is allowed to import at module instantiation time. However, this scan appears to have bugs (or at least, can cause false positives) because it doesn't appear to do any scope analysis. Node will incorrectly consider the module to export something even if the assignment is done to a local variable instead of to the module-level `exports` object. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // confuseNode.js\n    exports.confuseNode = function(exports) {\n      // If this local is called \"exports\", node incorrectly\n      // thinks this file has an export called \"notAnExport\".\n      exports.notAnExport = function() {\n      };\n    };\n    ```\n\n    You can see that node incorrectly thinks the file `confuseNode.js` has an export called `notAnExport` when that file is loaded in an ES module context:\n\n    ```console\n    $ node -e 'import(\"./confuseNode.js\").then(console.log)'\n    [Module: null prototype] {\n      confuseNode: [Function (anonymous)],\n      default: { confuseNode: [Function (anonymous)] },\n      notAnExport: undefined\n    }\n    ```\n\n    To avoid this, esbuild will now rename local variables that use the names `exports` and `module` when generating CommonJS output for the `node` platform.\n\n-   Fix the return value of esbuild's `super()` shim ([#&#8203;3538](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3538))\n\n    Some people write `constructor` methods that use the return value of `super()` instead of using `this`. This isn't too common because [TypeScript doesn't let you do that](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37847) but it can come up when writing JavaScript. Previously esbuild's class lowering transform incorrectly transformed the return value of `super()` into `undefined`. With this release, the return value of `super()` will now be `this` instead:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      field\n      constructor() {\n        console.log(typeof super())\n      }\n    }\n    new Foo\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        var __super = (...args) => {\n          super(...args);\n          __publicField(this, \"field\");\n        };\n        console.log(typeof __super());\n      }\n    }\n    new Foo();\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        var __super = (...args) => {\n          super(...args);\n          __publicField(this, \"field\");\n          return this;\n        };\n        console.log(typeof __super());\n      }\n    }\n    new Foo();\n    ```\n\n-   Terminate the Go GC when esbuild's `stop()` API is called ([#&#8203;3552](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3552))\n\n    If you use esbuild with WebAssembly and pass the `worker: false` flag to `esbuild.initialize()`, then esbuild will run the WebAssembly module on the main thread. If you do this within a Deno test and that test calls `esbuild.stop()` to clean up esbuild's resources, Deno may complain that a `setTimeout()` call lasted past the end of the test. This happens when the Go is in the middle of a garbage collection pass and has scheduled additional ongoing garbage collection work. Normally calling `esbuild.stop()` will terminate the web worker that the WebAssembly module runs in, which will terminate the Go GC, but that doesn't happen if you disable the web worker with `worker: false`.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now attempt to terminate the Go GC in this edge case by calling `clearTimeout()` on these pending timeouts.\n\n-   Apply `/* @&#8203;__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */` on tagged template literals ([#&#8203;3511](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3511))\n\n    Tagged template literals that reference functions annotated with a `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` comment are now able to be removed via tree-shaking if the result is unused. This is a convention from [Rollup](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5024). Here is an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const html = /* @&#8203;__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */ (a, ...b) => ({ a, b })\n    html`<a>remove</a>`\n    x = html`<b>keep</b>`\n\n    // Old output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    const html = /* @&#8203;__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */ (a, ...b) => ({ a, b });\n    html`<a>remove</a>`;\n    x = html`<b>keep</b>`;\n\n    // New output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    const html = /* @&#8203;__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */ (a, ...b) => ({ a, b });\n    x = html`<b>keep</b>`;\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature currently only works within a single file, so it's not especially useful. This feature does not yet work across separate files. I still recommend using `@__PURE__` annotations instead of this feature, as they have wider tooling support. The drawback of course is that `@__PURE__` annotations need to be added at each call site, not at the declaration, and for non-call expressions such as template literals you need to wrap the expression in an IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression) to create a call expression to apply the `@__PURE__` annotation to.\n\n-   Publish builds for IBM AIX PowerPC 64-bit ([#&#8203;3549](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3549))\n\n    This release publishes a binary executable to npm for IBM AIX PowerPC 64-bit, which means that in theory esbuild can now be installed in that environment with `npm install esbuild`. This hasn't actually been tested yet. If you have access to such a system, it would be helpful to confirm whether or not doing this actually works.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr (ng-packagr)</summary>\n\n###

seems to be resolved incorrectly as `../node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts/fa-brands-400.ttf` whereas the actual path is

The app itself runs fine with `ng serve` with styles and icons being displayed correctly. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this is an error with Angular or somewhere in the chain of Karma, sass, post-css, fontawesome etc.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project `ng new` with scss\r\n2. Add karma configs `ng generate config karma`\r\n3. Install FontAwesome `npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`\r\n4.

loading API","State":"open","Body":"Currently the `@angular/google-maps` module is implemented on top of the legacy `<script>` API which is problematic, because:\r\n1. It loads all of the JavaScript up-front, even if there are no maps on the page.\r\n2. It requires the user to ensure that the API is fully loaded before the `<google-map>` component starts rendering. Lazy-loading in this scenario is error-prone and loading the API up-front leads to a lot of unused JavaScript being loaded.\r\n\r\nThese changes add support for the [Dynamic Library Import API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#dynamic-library-import) which requires a tiny script to be added up-front which then allows the `<google-map>` to load the chunks of the API it needs on-demand. The legacy API is still supported, but is no longer recommended.\r\n\r\nAll the components also now have `initialized` outputs to make it easier to know when the underlying Maps classes have been created and can be interacted with.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28307","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(google-maps): add support for dynamic library loading API\" (#28307)"},{"Id":"2048107675","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-19T07:48:18","Actor":"DhanyaGopinathTR","Number":"28306","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(menuitem - accessibility): Role menuitem is not announced by screen readers","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEven though the menuitem role is added by default to the mat-menu-item, this is not reading by the screen readers like NVDA.\r\n\r\nFor eg:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mat-menu-in-angular-material/\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/86048403/ef861c4c-197e-480e-8538-485f3774458d)\r\n\r\n\r\n![example-mat-menu-item](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/86048403/9b55bc70-03be-4fdd-b247-a7925c967e1d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

The ability to dynamically update attributes such as mat-fab, and others that significantly alter the layout or styling, is currently limited post-initialization.\r\n\r\nThe existing workarounds for this limitation are often complex and can significantly impact performance.\r\n\r\n**Current Workarounds and Their Limitations**: \r\n\r\nI have attempted several approaches, including:\r\n\r\n1. **Manually setting the attribute using Renderer2 and ElementRef**: While this method provides direct control over component attributes, it can lead to verbose and complex code, especially when dealing with multiple attributes and components. Moreover, it requires careful management of Angular's Lifecycle, adding a layer of complexity in ensuring that attribute changes align with Angular's change detection and update cycles.\r\n    \r\n2. **Creating a Proxy around the component element to intercept and apply attribute changes**: This approach offers a degree of flexibility and a more elegant solution for attribute manipulation. However, it adds an additional layer of complexity and can be challenging to manage across different components. Additionally, the reliance on Metaprogramming techniques, which are less familiar to many developers, can hinder maintainability and reduce the ease of updates.\r\n    \r\n3. **Forcing the component to re-render by updating a key value within an `*ngIf` directive**: This approach, although effective in certain scenarios, can lead to performance issues. It involves destroying and recreating components, which is inefficient and resource-intensive, especially for large and interactive UIs. Such a method goes against Angular's philosophy of efficient, reactive UI updates and can drastically affect the user experience in more complex applications.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIn many web applications, the UI needs to respond dynamically to user actions and other application states. For example, a button may need to change from a standard button (`mat-button`) to a floating action button (`mat-fab`) based on a user's selection or a specific state in the application. \r\n\r\nCurrently, such dynamic changes require workarounds that are less efficient and potentially less performant. Having native support for this functionality would streamline the development process, reduce the need for custom solutions, and align Angular Material more closely with dynamic and reactive design patterns.\r\n\r\nAnother significant use case for this feature is the **creation of interfaces designed to configure other software interfaces.** \r\n\r\nSuch UIs need to dynamically respond to runtime changes efficiently, adapting their appearance and functionality on the fly. \r\n\r\nThis feature would be particularly valuable in scenarios where developers are building highly interactive and configurable environments, eliminating the need to prepare static lists of elements. Instead, developers could leverage Angular Material to dynamically adapt UI components like buttons to varying requirements and states, enhancing the overall flexibility and user experience.\r\n\r\nThis capability is crucial in modern software development, where adaptability and responsiveness are key to meeting diverse and evolving user needs and expectations.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the continuous efforts of the Angular Material team in advancing the framework and thank you for considering this feature request.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhanced Support for Dynamically Setting Attributes Across Angular Material Components (e.g. `mat-fab`, to Change Button Variants at Runtime).\" (#28292)"},{"Id":"2044274021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T19:33:42","Actor":"tomasdev","Number":"28291","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatButton): FAB with disabled state using alpha on background collisions","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<img width=\"138\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-15 at 2 33 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/components/assets/364033/8c95857b-c68e-44f9-b14b-1c96c639b860\">\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the disabled state background color is defined with alpha, FAB collide with page contents when disabled.

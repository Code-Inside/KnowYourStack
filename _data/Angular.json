And the deeper problem of only supporting `| null` and not `| undefined` in Angular...","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIt seems the saga of `| null` and its infectious nature in TypeScript code continues in Angular 15... \r\n\r\nCurrent problem, which triggered the creation of this issue. In versions of Angular prior to 15, it used to be possible to pass any value to `*ngTemplateOutlet`.  This included `null`, OR `undefined` meaning if you did not have a value, then the template did not render. In Angular 15, it seems the type possibilities have been NARROWED by the explicit use of `ngTemplateOutlet: TemplateRef<any> | null`. This narrowing of allowed types is forcing developers to explicitly deal with this non-allowance of `undefined`, which has become a very significant problem with Angular.\r\n\r\nFirst off, some basic background. I've shared these [thoughts a couple of years ago with regards to the `async` pipe ](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/43727) and IT'S expansion of types by ADDING `| null` which imposes significant typing issues with strict typescript compilation. Due to the ongoing issue with `AsyncPipe` adding `| null` to its output, I've switched entirely to the `@rx-anglular/template` library's `PushPipe` which seems to handle output typing better with seamless support for null and undefined without forcing the developer to add `| null` to all of their types.\r\n\r\nTo lay the groundwork, the nature of `null` vs. `undefined`:\r\n\r\n1. In JavaScript/TypeScript `null` is not the same as `undefined`, even though they sometimes behave similarly\r\n2. In JavaScript, `undefined` is explicitly the only supported option that triggers things like default parameter values, or optional parameters, non-rendering of properties when serialized with JSON.stringigy, etc. \r\n3. In JavaScript, `null` does NOT trigger things like default parameter values, it is serialized with JSON.stringify, etc. \r\n4. When considering `null`, it should be thought of as an explicit VALUE that represents nothingness. \r\n6. When considering `undefined`, it should be thought of as an explicit STATE of being that represents non-existence.\r\n\r\nIn other words, `null` is a value that can be passed and set that represents a current value of \"nothingness\" for any value, `undefined` represents non-existence and triggers language features that rely on this explicit state of non-existence. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to inputs, supporting only `null` but not `undefined` is overtly ignoring a very critical feature of the underlying language platform, and forcing developers to explicitly deal with the expectation of \"something or `null`\" when previously, we simply didn't have to bother or think about it...if we did not have an existing thing, stuff just worked, and if we DID have some thing, stuff still just worked. When it comes to outputs, by explicitly using `| null` rather than `| undefined` again forces developers to deal with the `null` possibility. This increases the complexity of our code. This is not \"natural\" or \"idiomatic\" in JavaScript. If you get something that is undefined, it is simply undefined, and natural idiomatic language features can be used to handle that state of non-existence seamlessly. On the other hand, if something is `null`, then you MUST deal with the possibility of null...which means infesting ever growing swaths of your codebase with `| null` attachments to your existing typing, explicit null checks and added complexity to your code.\r\n\r\nThe insistence by the Angular team on forcing their developers to deal with `null` is sadly making this framework, under strict typing rules, harder and harder to work with. Something really needs to be done here to support `undefined` properly, broadly, so that developers can seamlessly work with natural, idomatic language features of JavaScript and TypeScript, and NOT have to explicitly tack on `| null` or add explicit null checks and fallbacks throughout their code bases in order to interact with Angular features. When it comes to INPUTs, such as the ngTemplateOutlet directive, this should be very easy. Expanding the allowed types to include `| undefined` in addition to the current `TemplateRef<any> | null` should be non-breaking in every case. \r\n\r\nIn the case of return types...as indicated by the commentary on my previous issue linked above about the `AsyncPipe` and its issues with `| null`, switching from `null` to `undefined` is clearly not as simple. IMO, the use of `null` is not idiomatic in TypeScript, whereas use of `undefined` is in both JavaScript and TypeScript, and many language features explicitly require an undefined value rather than null to be triggered. \r\n\r\nI had hoped this would be resolved with Angular 16, however at the current time it appears the `| null` issue is still rather endemic within the platform. A major version is the opportune time to deprecate signatures that force developers to add support for `null` in their code, while introducing overloads that support `undefined`...opening the door for removal of `| null` signatures in an eventual future version. I'm hoping that this issue can gain some traction before Angular 18 is released, and hopefully some of these issues can be resolved with a switch towards primarily supporting the idiomatic capabilities of TypeScript and JavaScript, rather than an odd, notably more complex language feature like `null`. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nUse `NgTemplateOutlet` in any app, pass in an undefined, in Angular 15\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nType TemplateRef<Thing> | undefined is not assignable to type TemplateRef<any> | null\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.9\r\nNode: 18.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, google-maps, language-service, material\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.9\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAs Angular enforces tighter and tighter typing restrictions, the use of `| null` is becoming more and more problematic. I originally noted this issue back in October, 2021, when I opened the issue linked above about the `AsyncPipe` with Angular version 12. There have been four versions of Angular since then, and the use of `| null` seems to only have become even more extensive and problematic, with it appearing in template outlets, strictly typed forms (which has been rather devastating...I generally don't like to use strictly typed forms because using them has become so complicated, in large part but not limited to their enforcing `| null` in return values), and many other places.\r\n\r\n( I AM glad to see that the introduction of the `Signal` type to Angular did not also include another `| null` in its signature. That is a welcome improvement!)\r\n\r\nThe use of null and null checks in JavaScript and TypeScript code is considered a sign of an UNHEALTHY codebase (some good info on this in Refactoring Typescript by James Hicky, an MVP on the TypeScript team at Microsoft.) \r\n\r\nI'm a HUGE fan of Angular. It is my preferred framework. Never liked React, don't enjoy using it. I find the mutation-based change detection of Vue frustrating. However I've been rather dismayed at how stricter typing with Angular seems  to have made my life harder, often a lot harder, rather than easier. I think most of that, comes from the use of `null` rather than the idiomatic `undefined`...and sadly, I think that the extensive and growing use of `null` in the Angular codebase may indeed be a sign of poor health of the framework. \r\n\r\nIn desperation, I implore the Angular team to seriously consider the impact of forcing their end developers to deal with `null` from Angular, and at the very least consider, wherever possible, adding in overloaded method signatures capable of handling `undefined` as input (even if `null` remains supported). While I understand the potential breaking change that switching from `| null` to `| undefined` for return values may impose, in the long run, I think it will make using Angular a more pleasant experience, and I believe that is critical for the long term health of Angular and its broader ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThank you for getting this far!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51225","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"*ngTemplateOutlet problematically supports null, but not undefined, as input option...

website built using Angular and Universal, I noticed that browsers are repporting bad INP results because of page navigation. I created a new project with some pages and started noticing peculiar interactions between routing and INP metrics reported.\r\n\r\nSource code: https://github.com/webberig/inptest\r\nLive demo: https://webberig-inptest.netlify.app/\r\n\r\nThe app contains 4 pages and routes:\r\n- Page 1: most basic route setup, small html content\r\n- Page 2: route with a resolver that delays for 5 seconds, small html content\r\n- Page 3: no resolver/delay, fairly large HTML table rendered\r\n- Page 4: resolver that delays for 10ms, the same HTML table as page 3\r\n\r\nWith dev tools open and the Web vitals extension installed, I noticed some weird results:\r\n- Pages 1 and 3 report INP metrics. Pages 2 and 4 do not\r\n- Page 3 has a bad INP score, page 1 is good\r\n\r\n=> I seem to be able to avoid INP metrics by adding an async resolver to the routes.\r\n\r\nI don't know if measuring INP during soft-navs is intended or not. Either way, some changes may be needed to the router to optimize (or avoid) INP metrics.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://webberig-inptest.netlify.app/\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.9\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.9\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51211","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router and INP (Interactive to Next Paint) metrics\" (#51211)"},{"Id":"1828182434","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-31T01:16:11","Actor":"mgg43err","Number":"51209","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update view-encapsulation.md","State":"open","Body":"change link to shadow dom api\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It only wraps the DOM API methods with Angular methods from what I have seen in the code. I'm not an expert in XSS attacks but I think that is an improvement but not total protection. Correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nSince probably a lot of people use it, can we make it actually solve some security problems so we can benefit from the current situation?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy proposal is to use the `DomSanitizer` 's `sanitize()` method when using `Renderer2` methods like:\r\n\r\n- [setAttribute()](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2#setattribute)\r\n- [addClass()](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2#addclass)\r\n- [setStyle()](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2#setstyle)\r\n- [setProperty()](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2#setproperty)\r\n- [setValue()](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2#setvalue)\r\n\r\nThis way the usage of the `Rendere2` would make more sense, if of course, it is not planned to be deprecated.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a good idea, I would also gladly implement the feature.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nImplement some sort of a feature that would be a norm for direct DOM accessing in some other code segment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51208","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Utilize DomSanitizer in Renderer2\" (#51208)"},{"Id":"1828036552","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-30T19:03:04","Actor":"ToneyPK","Number":"51207","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: mention DomSanitizer in ElementRef documentation","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It only provides a wrapper method around it thus we are not using DOM API directly when coding, which is fine, but doesn't provide any additional security so it might be confusing.

The directive has no method `changes`. This is confusing. Please document what the method `changes` describes.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm currently profiling a closed source app. Hence, I can't share the code.

After I refresh the website it works fine. \r\n\r\nThe injection inside `CanActivateFn` function does not retrieve the latest signal value after the signal is updated.\r\n\r\nThis is the `CanActivateFn`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const RegisteredGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\r\n  return inject(AuthService).isUserInRoles(['registered']) ? true : inject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['/login']);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const AllContentGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => {\r\n  return !environment.protectAllContentWithAuthentication ? true :\r\n    inject(AuthService).isUserInRoles(['registered']) ? true : inject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['/login']);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the `AuthService`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class AuthService {\r\n  auth: WritableSignal<IAuth | undefined>;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private cookieService: CookieService,\r\n    private nav: NavigationService,\r\n    private notification: NotificationService\r\n  ) {\r\n    this.auth = this.initAuth();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private initAuth() {\r\n    return signal(this.getCookieAuth());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private getCookieAuth() {\r\n    const auth = this.cookieService.get('auth');\r\n    return auth ? JSON.parse(auth) : undefined;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  setAuth(auth: IAuth) {\r\n    // Set cookie to expire in 30 days\r\n    this.cookieService.set(\r\n      'auth',\r\n      JSON.stringify(auth),\r\n      environment.authExpiresAfter\r\n        ? new Date(Date.now() + environment.authExpiresAfter)\r\n        : undefined\r\n    );\r\n    this.auth.set(auth);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  removeAuth() {\r\n    this.cookieService.delete('auth');\r\n    this.auth.set(undefined);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  logout() {\r\n    this.removeAuth();\r\n    this.notification.success('You have been logged out');\r\n    this.nav.navigateByUrl('/login');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  isUserInRoles(roles: string[]) {\r\n    return this.auth()?.roles?.some((r) => roles.includes(r)) ?? false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my `app-route`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n  ...accountRoute,\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: LayoutComponent,\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: '',\r\n        component: IndexPageComponent,\r\n        pathMatch: 'full',\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'index',\r\n        component: IndexPageComponent,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'account',\r\n        component: ProfilePageComponent,\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    canActivate: [AllContentGuard],\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that all of my content is guarded by `AllContentGuard`. The user has to be logged in to be able to see the content. The problem here is that this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  isUserInRoles(roles: string[]) {\r\n    return this.auth()?.roles?.some((r) => roles.includes(r)) ?? false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes not get the `this.auth()` values correctly. It gives me `undefined`, even after I set the auth from this `login-page.component.ts`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  async login() {\r\n    this.loading.set(true);\r\n    const res = await this.http.post<IAuth>('/login', null, {\r\n      email: this.email(),\r\n      password: this.password(),\r\n    });\r\n    this.loading.set(false);\r\n\r\n    if (res) {\r\n      if (res.error) {\r\n        this.notification.error(res.msg);\r\n      } else if (res.data) {\r\n        this.auth.setAuth(res.data);\r\n\r\n        // If user is not confirmed, redirect to confirm email page\r\n        if (!res.data.confirmed) {\r\n          this.notification.warning(this.str()('emailNotConfirmed'));\r\n          setTimeout(() => this.nav.navigateByUrl('/confirm-email'), 1000);\r\n        } else {\r\n          this.notification.success(this.str()('loginSuccess'));\r\n          this.nav.navigateToIndex();\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI even tried to setup the navigation wrapped in `setTimeout()` to see if there is delay for the signal updates, but it is the same.\r\n\r\nThe problem only occurs when I go to `http://localhost:4201` as my app is hosted. If I refresh the page immediately after I open the website, it works fine, but not when first opening the web.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs only when I go to `http://localhost:4201`, which is redirected to `http://localhost:4201/login`. If I go by typing `http://localhost:4201/login`, it works fine.\r\n\r\nSo the flow is like this:\r\n\r\nFirst open website -> go to `http://localhost:4201` -> got redirected for the first time from `CanActivateFn` by `AllContentGuard` to `http://localhost:4201/login` -> login and sets the auth -> Then the guard always retrieves undefined auth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nOk so, after getting redirected by the guard `AllContentGuard`, the guard loses the connection to the auth signal. It is no longer able to get the update from the signal.\r\n\r\nDoes redirecting using this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninject(NavigationService).router.createUrlTree(['login'])\r\n```\r\nremoves the connection with the signal?

This causes ES Modules in the output with non-configurable methods/properties. As a result, we cannot mock JS modules. This leads to tests that pull lots of external dependencies (utility functions, config objects etc.) that are not provided using the DI and hence cannot be stubbed using Angular DI.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nScaffold an app and use Jest as a testing tool. Modify AppComponent.ngOnInit\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  if (isDevMode())  {\r\n    console.log('dev');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the test try to stub the `isDevMode`.\r\n\r\n```\r\njest.mock('@angular/core', () => ({\r\n    ...jest.requireActual('@angular/core'),\r\n    isDevMode: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(false)\r\n}))\r\n\r\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\r\n    let component: AppComponent;\r\n\r\n    beforeEach(() => {\r\n        component = new AppComponent()\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    describe('ngOnInit', () => {\r\n        it('should not log when in prod mode', () => {\r\n            const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log')\r\n            component.ngOnInit()\r\n            expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled()\r\n        });\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nTest fail due to a number of reasons which are related to ES Build in the end:\r\na. ES Build outputs a module with a different name and there is a mismatch\r\nb. ES Build embeds a module (e.g. import of the environments file)\r\nc. JS runtime error that you try to change the property that cannot be configurable. This happens if you try to import the module in the tests and spy on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nimport * as module from 'module'\r\n\r\njest.spyOnProperty(module, 'method').mockReturnValue(...)\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.0.5\r\nNode: 18.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1600.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         16.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   16.0.5 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          16.0.5 (cli-only)\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis feels like a big deal, because most of the current state tests will become invalid.

The documentation for this component is still poor, so it's entirely possible that I'm not understanding the proper use.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [YouTube documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters), `listType` can be `playlist` or `user_uploads`.  However, the Angular project will not build successfully when I attempt to set `listType` to any value.  There also doesn't seem to be a `ListType` enum exposed, like some of the other properties (such as `AutoPlay`, etc.).  This would be helpful in feeding it a proper value since it clearly doesn't like the strings `playlist` or `user_uploads`.\r\n\r\nLooking in the \"Type definitions for YouTube\", it seems like there _should_ be `ListType` type exported, but I'm not sure how to make use of it and I'm not seeing it in the `YT` namespace.  Interestingly, the index.d.ts file for the type definitions defines the first potential value for `ListType` as `player` - not `playlist`.  This seems to be inconsistent with the YouTube documentation.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n`<youtube-player [playerVars]=\"playerVars\"></youtube-player>`\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayerVars = {\r\n    autoplay: 1,\r\n    controls: 1,\r\n    list: 'LISTID',\r\n    listType: 'playlist',\r\n    modestbranding: 1\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFull support for the PlayerVars object, per the YouTube documentation\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nbuild errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypes of property 'listType' are incompatible.\r\n    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ListType | undefined'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.1.6\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(youtube-player): PlayerVars\" (#27528)"},{"Id":"1824286462","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-27T16:53:29","Actor":"Abdullah-Haroon004","Number":"27526","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkScrollable is working but its scroll-bar is not visible in IPAD Device and Iphone Devices.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe Scrolling feature is working on IPAD Devices as well as the drag-and-drop item scroll.

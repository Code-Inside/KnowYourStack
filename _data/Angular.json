As a result, some useful information (like reference to a specific field) was missing. Replacing Error class with FatalDiagnosticError one makes the error more verbose that should simplify debugging.\r\n\r\nNote: a test that is checking this behavior was moved from `compliance` to `ngtsc` due to the fact that the `compile` function used in compliance tests doesn't have proper instrumentation to work with `FatalDiagnosticError` errors (the error [is intercepted and not thrown](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/transform/src/compilation.ts#L207), thus require additional handling in `compile` function used in compliance tests).

EXCEPT for it doen't :D (Continue reading point: Description)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe above technique works when fields *CAN* be set onto a same formGroup.\r\n\r\nHere in my [Stackoverflow_Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56567358/use-advanced-custom-validation-across-multiple-mat-steps) I describe a situation where the FormControls that DEPEND on each other cannot be inside a nested FormGroup. I have to go all the way up to the root level, which as you will [SEE](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-sswrvn?file=app%2Fstepper-errors-example.html) has some downsides and lots of boilerplate.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe it any better than already done im my [stackoverflow_question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56567358/use-advanced-custom-validation-across-multiple-mat-steps).\r\n\r\n+ The essence being: 3 FormControls are spreaded accross 3 `mat-steps` but they should validate together.\r\n\r\nI present a working solution in my Stackblitz but I also show the problems I have with this approach in my SO-Question.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to what is described HERE => #23293 .\r\n\r\nWe need the effect of template driven `registerOnValidatorChange(fn: () => void): void { this._onChange = fn; }` with reactive Forms on the level of `new FormControl()`.\r\n\r\nAnd here I have to admit I dont fully know where this can go/ be implementet. So im just brainstorming here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/98515e1ecf2227e1ab9f01694c5bb2d6ba8ed36b/packages/forms/src/model.ts#L1000\r\n\r\n```\r\n//constructor(\r\n//      formState: any = null,\r\n//      validatorOrOpts?: ValidatorFn|ValidatorFn[]|AbstractControlOptions|null,\r\n//      asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn|AsyncValidatorFn[]|null,\r\n        deps?: string[],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`deps` are only allowed when we have a root formGroup.\r\n\r\nThis would change:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ValidatorFn {\r\n  (control: AbstractControl, deps?: AbstractControl[]): ValidationErrors | null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can use information of depending form fields on a formControl level:\r\n\r\n`deps` should be passed on as paths starting from the root level formGroup/ array.\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.registerForm = new FormGroup({\r\n            password: new FormControl(\r\n                '', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]], undefined, ['confirmPassword']\r\n            ),\r\n            confirmPassword: new FormControl(\r\n                '', Validators.required], undefined, ['password']\r\n            ),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally we could use `deps`\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function MustMatch2(): ValidatorFn {\r\n\r\n    function isEmptyInputValue(value: any): boolean {\r\n    // we don't check for string here so it also works with arrays\r\n      return value == null || value.length === 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return (control: AbstractControl, deps: AbstractControl[] ): ValidationErrors | null => {\r\n      if ([...deps, control].some(el => isEmptyInputValue(el)) {\r\n        return null;  // don't validate empty values to allow optional controls\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n    if ( deps.every( c => c.value === control.value ) ) {\r\n      return null;\r\n    } else {\r\n      return { mustMatch: true }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope its clear what im going for.

Or press the 'convert' button.\r\n\r\nSince the template only contains dummy test content within a <p> tag, i'd suggest to remove the whitespace and indentation, which will resolve this issue for most users, for the file then does not have an active indentation.

Open the StackBlitz from the Autocomplete documentation in Chrome\r\n2. Select \"One\" in the autocomplete input\r\n3. Clear the input by selecting the whole word and pressing backspace\r\n4. Select \"Two\"\r\n5. Press CTRL+Z on your keyboard\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\nThe input should be cleared, as the last action that can be undone is inserting the selected entry into the empty input.\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior?\r\nThe previously selected entry is concatenated to the input text, i.e. the input's content is now \"TwoOne\".\r\n\r\n### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\nThe undo functionality is only useful to users if it works intuitively, which means that it should always reset the input to the state in which it was right before the very last user action. If it only undoes certain actions (adding and removing text by using the keyboard) while other actions are ignored (selecting an entry in the dropdown menu) then users may find this confusing and annoying.\r\n\r\n### Which versions of AngularJS, Material, OS, and browsers are affected?\r\n<!-- Please note that only issues related to AngularJS 1.x and AngularJS Material 1.x should be submitted here.\r\nPlease submit Angular Material and CDK questions [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular-material2) and issues [here](https://github.com/angular/components/issues).\r\n-->\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0, 8.0.1\r\n- Angular Material: 8.0.0, 8.0.1\r\n- OS: Windows 10\r\n- Browsers: Chrome 75.0, Internet Explorer 11.3\r\n \r\n### Is there anything else we should know? Stack Traces, Screenshots, etc.\r\nIn Firefox the previous entry is not concatenated to the current input text when pressing CTRL+Z. However, the selection of the second entry is not undone, either.

In the current markup of material date picker, ABBR attribute is missing from it's column headers.\r\nThe table used here has **number** dates as it's row data and acronyms of weekdays as its's column data. In here an ABBR attribute can be added to better assist the screen reader in providing context when navigating within the table.\r\n\r\n        <thead class=\"mat-calendar-table-header\">\r\n             <tr>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Sunday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">S</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Monday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">M</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Tuesday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">T</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Wednesday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">W</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Thursday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">T</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Friday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">F</th>\r\n               <th aria-label=\"Saturday\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\">S</th>\r\n           </tr>\r\n      </thead>\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             In here an ABBR attribute can be added to better assist the screen reader\r\n             in providing context when navigating within the table.\r\n\r\n2.  In the current markup of material date picker, Please update each of the year div's to include the role of button so that the keyboard and screen reader user can navigate to and be provided proper context and useability.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             By setting the role attribute to button on the year's markup screen\r\n             reader can identify and announce it as a button. So that the users can it to\r\n             their advantage.\r\n\r\n3.  After launching the date picker and clicking on the Month/Year button, focus is currently set within the section that contains the year selection controls.  The issue is that the entire section is read after the selection and not set to the current year as done visually. So after the selection of a year, please set focus to the selected year as done visually.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             By this change users can be notified visually and contextually since it helps\r\n             the screen readers to announce and makes more 508 compatible.\r\n\r\n4.  In the current markup of material date picker, aria-haspopup attribute is currently added incorrectly on the input field instead of the button that triggers the opening of the control.  This is confusing since the user will only open the control via the button and not by the input. So suggestion is to remove the aria markup from the input and add it to only the button that actually triggers the opening of the control.\r\n\r\n         <input  \r\n            class=\"mat-input-element mat-form-field-autofill-control cdk-text-field-autofill- \r\n            monitored ng-pristine ng-valid ng-touched\" id=\"date\" matinput=\"\" \r\n            placeholder=\"MM/DD/YYYY\"\r\n            aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-required=\"false\">\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             This change helps the users with screen readers to announce functionality\r\n             keeps them  away from confusing and thus makes more 508 compatible.\r\n\r\n5.  In the current markup of material date picker, There is a row and TD cells within the data table of the control.  There is no need to include the empty row and the TD cell containing the Month name since it does not provide value to the user using the screen reader. So, removing this from the table data will assist the screen reader in announcing the data effectively to the end user.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n            This change helps the screen reader in announcing the data effectively to \r\n            the end user and helps more towards 508 compatibility.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16317","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Few accessibility features for date picker for better 508 compatibility\" (#16317)"},{"Id":"457379160","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-18T14:22:43","Actor":"ashutosh1812","Number":"16314","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template parse errors: Can't bind to 'product' since it isn't a known property of 'app-product-alerts'.","State":"closed","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\ni have just started my first basic app in angular using stackblitz but it is giving me some error while adding new component and doing the same given instruction in tutorial. also pasting the whole stack trace please help.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nError in /turbo_modules/@angular/compiler@8.0.1/bundles/compiler.umd.js (2479:21)\r\nTemplate parse errors:\r\nCan't bind to 'product' since it isn't a known property of 'app-product-alerts'.\r\n1.

The result is that:\r\n* We duplicate less information between the `TNode` and the directive definition.\r\n* `DirectiveDef.inputs` has a consistent type no matter how an input is configured which makes it easier to reason about.\r\n* We need less information in order to write to a directive's input.\r\n* We can remove the `InputTransformsFeature`.\r\n* We can remove the `DirectiveDef.inputTransforms` field.\r\n* We no longer need to store input flags in `TNode.inputs`.\r\n* We store 2 fewer values in the `TNode.initialInputs` data structure.\r\n* We don't resolve the native element for property writes in production mode. In development mode it's only used for the `ng-reflect-` attributes.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): simplify how inputs are stored in the directive definition\r\nCurrently the values in `DirectiveDef.inputs` are either strings or arrays, depending if there are flags. This makes it a bit hard to work with, because each time it's read, the consumer needs to account for both cases.\r\n\r\nThese changes rework it so the values are always an arrays.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): remove inputTransforms from definition \r\nRemoves the `inputTransform` from the directive definition since this information is already available on the `inputs`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): remove input transforms feature \r\nAn earlier refactor made the `InputTransformsFeature` a no-op so these changes remove the code that was generating it.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): remove flags from TNode.inputs \r\nThe input flags are already available on the definition so we don't need to store them on `TNode.inputs`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): simplify InitialInputs data structure\r\nReworks the `InitialInputs` data structure to only store a public name and initial value, resulting in less memory usage and making it easier to work with.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): refactor(core): avoid unnecessary lookup when writing inputs\r\nCurrently we resolve the DOM node when writing inputs up-front, because it's necessary for the `ng-reflect-` attributes. Since the attributes are dev-mode-only, we can move the resolution into the function that writes them so we can avoid the resolution when it's not used.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add assertion to avoid writes to directive factories\r\nAttempting to write to directive inputs before the directive is created can lead to subtle issues that won't necessarily trigger errors. These changes add an assertion to catch such issues earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59980","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Input writing refactors\" (#59980)"},{"Id":"2861440799","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T19:27:38","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"60001","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [17.3.x]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60001","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [17.3.x]\" (#60001)"},{"Id":"2861306681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T19:26:55","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"60000","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update to latest dev-infra actions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60000","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update to latest dev-infra actions\" (#60000)"},{"Id":"2861267661","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T18:24:42","Actor":"sumitarora","Number":"59999","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(devtools): adding route details panel for selected route","State":"open","Body":"On clicking a route in the router tree, the route details panel is displayed.\r\n- The panel shows the details of the selected route, including the path, component, providers, guards etc.\r\n- Clicking on a chip will navigate to the corresponding source file in the editor.\r\n- Clicking on the path will navigate to the corresponding route in the router tree.\r\n\r\nDemo Application Source: https://github.com/sumitarora/angular-routes-demo\r\nDemo Application Deployed: https://sumitarora.github.io/angular-routes-demo/#/\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d5f4da-094d-405d-9dc2-655976c26f9a)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2399dfe0-3494-464c-9532-62eb880a89be)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59999","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): adding route details panel for selected route\" (#59999)"},{"Id":"2859936098","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T16:50:05","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"59986","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency shiki to v3","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [shiki](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/tree/HEAD/packages/shiki)) | devDependencies | major | [`^2.0.0` -> `^3.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/shiki/2.3.2/3.0.0) |\n| [shiki](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/tree/HEAD/packages/shiki)) | dependencies | major | [`^2.0.0` -> `^3.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/shiki/2.5.0/3.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>shikijs/shiki (shiki)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/releases/tag/v3.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/compare/v2.5.0...v3.0.0)\n\n#####    🚨 Breaking Changes\n\n-   Remove deprecated apis for v3.0  -  by [@&#8203;antfu](https://redirect.github.com/antfu) in [https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/900](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/900) [<samp>(55c15)</samp>](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/commit/55c1554b)\n-   Remove `node10` typescript resolution support  -  by [@&#8203;userquin](https://redirect.github.com/userquin) in [https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/923](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/923) [<samp>(ccb58)</samp>](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/commit/ccb5856b)\n-   **twoslash**: Make default `moduleResolution` to `bundler`  -  by [@&#8203;antfu](https://redirect.github.com/antfu) in [https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/936](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/936) [<samp>(e924d)</samp>](https://redirect.github.com/shikijs/shiki/commit/e924d4b1)\n\n#####    🐞 Bug Fixes\n\n-   **transformers**:\n    -

It does when loading `ContactComponent` eagerly.\n\n| Eager | Lazy |\n|--------|--------|\n| Idle ok | Idle ok |\n| Viewport ok | Viewport ko |\n| Immediate ko | Immediate ko | \n\n\nThe other triggers`hydrate on hover`, `hydrate on interaction`, `hydrate on timer`, `hydrate when` are all working.\n\nThx a lot guys !\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/jimjim2a/loadcomponent-hydration\n\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.7\nNode: 20.18.2\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.7\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.7\n@angular/cli                    19.1.7\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.7\n@schematics/angular             19.1.7\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59997","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Incremental hydration : @defer (hydrate on immediate) is never triggered on a routed component\" (#59997)"},{"Id":"2860360264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T12:49:16","Actor":"ErsinCabuk","Number":"59996","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResourceRef.reload must be Observable or Signal.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhy do I need this?

Perhaps code needs to pass the CustomErrorHandler TWO exceptions in the case of primary/secondary as today it received the 2ndary render exception and not the primary exception which was the original cause(ie. without the primary, the 2ndary would not happen).  I spent hours on this before I finally found out what is going on (much because I was never given the primary exception and was given something in left field) -> \n\nIn my init method of my component we have this \n\n```\n        this._proposalSvc.proposalXref$\n            .pipe(takeUntil(this._unsubscribeAll))\n            .subscribe((response: FetchProposalXrefResponse) => {\n                this.xrefResponse = response;\n\n                if (\n                    this.xrefResponse.outline.trainingFormat ===\n                    ClassFormatEnumDto.MULTI_DAY\n                ) {\n                    this.isMultiDay = true;\n                }\n\n                this.statusInfo = new StatusInfo();\n                this.statusInfo.projectName = response.outline?.projectName;\n                this.statusInfo.stage = response.courseStage;\n                this.statusInfo.hasCredits = true;\n                this.statusInfo.creditsLeft = response?.customerCreditsLeft;\n\n                this.statusInfo.avatar = new AvatarInfo();\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.chatId = response.proposalXref?.xrefId;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.link = response?.otherParty?.avatar;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.firstName =\n                    response?.otherParty?.firstName;\n                this.statusInfo.avatar.lastName =\n                    response?.otherParty?.lastName;\n\n                this.calculateIfAvailable();\n            });\n```\n\nNow, if you throw an exception on the LAST line, GREAT!!!  If you throw an exception on the FIRST line, it will be hidden by a render exception.  Worse yet, the customErrorHandler is never told about the primary exception and that is the one we care about and need to fix ASAP.    The 2ndary can be fixed but not as important by making things optional in the html (things that are actually required but on failure will not be there).     \n\nIf you know of 'javas' try with resource,  try (stream str = openStream()) { .....code here }, it secretly has a stream.close() surrounded with a try..catch to not lose the primary exception.  it then adds the 'supressed' 2ndary exception to the primary so you have both (and you end up with array of suppression but the global error handler ends up with the primarys which has supressedErrors[].  Java also has chained exceptions.  this is when you catch, rethrow new Exception(\"my chain\", e); such that the new error links to old one (realy only for adding info that may only be available near the top of stack to the message.  (Do not confuse supressed and chained...two different concepts).\n\nI would love suppressed in the case of render failures!!!  \n\nI would LOVE to know if it was a render failure so I can just move the user to a solid bug page that I know will render cleanly.  \n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/core/ErrorHandler\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nA way to expose primary exceptions and not hide them if render fails in face of primary failure.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nmoving up and down throw new Error(\"test\") in my above code since the html page required some of those things to be setup. \n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\npass me TWO exceptions somehow in case of primary/secondary exceptions (usually bug then a render failure)\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\nno screen show.\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\nnot browser specific\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59976","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"clarity needed on primary exception -> render exception, primary exception hidden\" (#59976)"},{"Id":"2857301345","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T09:40:31","Actor":"sunio00000","Number":"59975","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): Support instanceof operator in Built-in control flow (Angular templates)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Description\n\nI'm interested in hearing opinions on allowing the use of the instanceof operator within the @if control block.

This limitation forces me to rely on the `!important` keyword to override these styles, which isn’t ideal.\n\nIs there a recommended approach or a potential enhancement to allow these inline styles to be assigned to a specific CSS layer by default?\n\nHere’s an example for reference:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/717631b1-a250-4182-bd59-19ed22fb5be2)\n\nThank you for the help!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a configuration option that allows developers to specify a CSS layer for the injected Material components' styles. Instead of inserting these styles without layer information, the library would wrap them in a `<style>` tag with the appropriate CSS layer attribute (e.g., `layer=\"material\"`). This change would enable more predictable cascading behavior and simplify style overrides by eliminating the need for `!important`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- **Overriding with `!important`**: Currently, developers rely on using `!important` to override the default styles. However, this approach can lead to maintenance issues and unintended side effects.\n- **Manual style injection**: Developers could manually override or inject additional CSS rules after the default styles load, but this solution is error-prone and lacks scalability.\n- **Custom style injection**: Overriding the internal style injection mechanism might be possible, but this would be a hacky workaround that could break with future updates.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30512","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possibility to set all Material's CSS in a specific CSS layer\" (#30512)"},{"Id":"2856807325","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T10:59:55","Actor":"kiarash-malekzadeh","Number":"30499","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelect): MatSelectTrigger does not show the initial default value","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have this code with mat-select which has a text inside the mat-select-trigger.

Download the project from StackBlitz.\n2. Start it and open in the Edge browser. Open the deprecated \"Detached elements\" tool.\n3. Drag an item from the \"To do\" column to the \"In progress\" column and then to \"Done\".\n4. Collect garbage in the \"Detached elements\" tool and check detached items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are no detached nodes related to the cdk-drag element.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere are 2 `cdk-drag-dragging` detached nodes. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fb8a7e-869d-4858-b1f0-b2d79177eb53)\n\nThe same result will be achieved if performed in Chrome, but more details can be seen in the Edge. If the \"Analyze\" button is clicked - you will get an id to the retainer (instead of the initial text \"Object not found in memory anymore\"). Double-clicking on it will show the retainer info. In this case, it's the `CdkDropList._dropListRef._draggables` array.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f25936c-c259-46f6-955a-73de1381b42b)\n\n**Some info after my analysis**: `_draggables` are set in the `DropListRef`'s `withItems` method.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56971d06-deaf-4f0d-86b8-8e73101221ed)\n\nWhile debugging I should have entered it via `_syncItemsWithRef`, but there's a `this._dropListRef.isDragging()` condition in the `removeItem` method. In my case, I've already dropped an item and it's no longer dragging. Therefore `_draggables` are not updated and there's a `cdk-drag` detached node because of that.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010937-ced3-4911-bd12-4ef965ab2085)\n\nI'm not sure if that condition should be there at all, cause surely we need to sync items with ref **not only when dragging is in progress**. Here's a [link to the commit](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/d1a6ea74db0881001bf02ff113f269552effc4f6) where those changes were added.\n\nFor my project, I monkey-patched `removeItem` method and removed `isDragging()` condition. For us, the case when an item should be removed while dragging is not relevant.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.6\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11 Pro\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[drag-drop] cdk-drag node is detached after element is dropped from one container to another\" (#30506)"},{"Id":"2857490290","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-17T10:55:22","Actor":"aceArt-GmbH","Number":"30502","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(tree): typescript/strong typing of nodes","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently `*matTreeNodeDef` types the resulting variable as `any`:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0caae8a-9a16-44d2-8697-7daee05fcc03)\n\n### Use Case\n\n>enable you to build web apps with confidence!\n\nThe lack of strong typing is really problematic for bigger projects, and it feels like a downgrade in developer experience compared to custom build trees.\n\nFurther motivation for this has been described in:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/16273\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28731\nhttps://nartc.me/blog/typed-mat-cell-def/\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/22290\n\nWorkaround copied from https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22290:\n```ts\nimport { CdkTreeNodeDef } from '@angular/cdk/tree';\nimport { Directive, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { MatTree, MatTreeNodeDef } from '@angular/material/tree';\n\n/**\n    matTreeNodeDef nodes currently have `any` as type.\n\n    Use workaround to properly type them.\n    Requires passing a reference to tree to each node.\n\n    CC same workaround for tables:\n    https://nartc.me/blog/typed-mat-cell-def/\n    https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28731\n    https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22290\n */\n@Directive({\n   selector: '[matTreeNodeDef]', // same selector as CdkTreeNodeDef\n   providers: [\n      { provide: CdkTreeNodeDef, useExisting: TypeSafeMatTreeNodeDefDirective },\n   ],\n})\nexport class TypeSafeMatTreeNodeDefDirective<T> extends MatTreeNodeDef<T> {\n   @Input() matTreeNodeDefTree?: MatTree<T>;\n\n   static ngTemplateContextGuard<T>(\n      dir: TypeSafeMatTreeNodeDefDirective<T>,\n      ctx: any,\n   ): ctx is { $implicit: T; index: number } {\n      return true;\n   }\n}\n```\n\n```diff\n-<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [childrenAccessor]=\"childrenAccessor\">\n+<mat-tree #tree [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [childrenAccessor]=\"childrenAccessor\">\n...\n-<mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef=\"let node;\" matTreeNodePadding>\n+<mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef=\"let node; tree: tree\" matTreeNodePadding>\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30502","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(tree): typescript/strong typing of nodes\" (#30502)"},{"Id":"2854800409","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T22:23:03","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"30495","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): listbox ui pattern","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30495","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): listbox ui pattern\" (#30495)"},{"Id":"2853981614","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T15:19:06","Actor":"JDillon522","Number":"30494","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MAT-CHECKBOX): Mat Checkbox  doesnt trigger change when clicked in center of icon","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOn v.18, when I click indide of the MatCheckox it doesnt trigger the `(change)` event, but clicking towards the outside of the box does.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI cannot reproduce in isolation but I also cant nail down _why_ it would do this. See the attached recording:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c6e12a-7745-4dfc-a99f-6bfe021e86c3)\n\nThis behavior is consistent in our application. Heres the code from this example:\n\n```html\n<mat-checkbox\n   color=\"primary\"\n   [checked]=\"isSelected(item)\"\n   (change)=\"toggleItem(item, $event.checked)\">\n</mat-checkbox>\n```\n\nWhen I click in the center of the checkbox it doesnt trigger the `toggleItem()` function. When I click in the center and it doesnt responde I can inspect that element. It takes me to the SVG `path` element:\n\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae5e4b8-7262-485b-8b04-cc9564d59ef3\" />\n\n\nBut when I inspect it when it does trigger the `(change)` event it takes me to the `input` element.\n\n<img width=\"677\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5059970c-1f84-4b63-af92-1179fa45a678\" />\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that the `z-index` is off. I set the `z-index` on the `input` to 400 (just to pick a random number) and it works fine. My dev tools show the `z-index` as `auto` normally though.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen I click anywhere inside the checkbox it triggers the `(change)` event.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt only triggers the change event when I click towards the outside of the element,  not in the middle of the checkbox.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.5\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.5\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30494","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MAT-CHECKBOX): Mat Checkbox  doesnt trigger change when clicked in center of icon\" (#30494)"},{"Id":"2853035731","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T08:47:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30492","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button): combine MatButton and MatAnchor","State":"open","Body":"Currently we have two directives for each button variant: `MatButton` which applies to `button` elements and `MatButtonAnchor` which applies to anchors.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic in a couple of ways:\r\n1.

The async pipe triggers a `markForCheck` for the component, while change detection is running.\r\n2. The refreshView [clears](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/60b5a3de9d1c249d2322e56612d11d67aecc1d82/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L477-L479) the dirty state of the component after the view has been checked.\r\n3. The [checkNoChanges](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/60b5a3de9d1c249d2322e56612d11d67aecc1d82/packages/core/src/application_ref.ts#L846-L850) is performed, and the [refreshComponent](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/60b5a3de9d1c249d2322e56612d11d67aecc1d82/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L1751-L1753) function does not perform a refreshView for that component, since it is no longer dirty.\r\n\r\nThis results in no ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError because the view is not checked, since its dirty status has been cleared in the change detection process\r\n\r\nThis can be really hard to debug without the warning. So I found a workaround for now, that is to add `|| isInCheckNoChangesMode()` to the [refreshView check](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/60b5a3de9d1c249d2322e56612d11d67aecc1d82/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L1751) so that it becomes `if (componentView[FLAGS] & (LViewFlags.CheckAlways | LViewFlags.Dirty) || isInCheckNoChangesMode()) {`. This is very ugly and imperformant, but at least it helps detect those errors.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ked7hw?file=src/app/app.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.3.2\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.18\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.2\r\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, cli, common, compiler\r\n... compiler-cli, core, forms, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\nwebpack                         5.72.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45612","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError is not thrown if ChangeDetection.OnPush is used\" (#45612)"},{"Id":"1201940557","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T12:55:51","Actor":"nkdweb","Number":"45600","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to stop downloading service worker cached resources on each & every page reload in Angular?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nservice-worker\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nEvery time the user refreshes the application, the Angular service worker checks for updates to the application by looking for updates to the ngsw.json manifest.

Unfortunately, the existing parser for objects in `__i18n*__` macros for tests expects an object with a maximum depth of only one (`{foo: 'bar'}`), while tests containing `original_code` go as deep as *six* (`{foo: {bar: {baz: {...}}}}`). This is compounded by the fact that Angular template evaluation also uses `{{ foo }}` which adds to the depth even though they are in string literals. I updated the object param regular expression to support a maximum of six levels of nesting in the object, which is good enough for now. Longer term we should really replace the system with a proper parser.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45606","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): add `original_code` to `goog.getMsg()` options\" (#45606)"},{"Id":"1202427751","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-12T22:26:52","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"45605","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: only allow renovate to run on Monday nights","State":"closed","Body":"By running renovate once a week, we can consolidate all the updates into a single weekly PR, and merge them Tuesday before each Wednesday release.

That is, the project might just include the component file through the program rather\r\nthan directly in the `include` glob of the `tsconfig`. This distinction is somewhat important\r\nbecause the TypeScript language service/server prefers projects which _directly_ contain the TS\r\nfile (see `projectContainsInfoDirectly` in the TS codebase). What this means it that there can\r\npossibly be a different project used between the TS and HTML files.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Nx projects, the referenced configs are `tsconfig.app.json` and\r\n`tsconfig.editor.json`. `tsconfig.app.json` comes first in the base `tsconfig.json` and\r\ncontains the entry point of the app. `tsconfig.editor.json` contains the `**.ts` glob of all TS\r\nfiles. This means that `tsconfig.editor.json` will be preferred by the TS server for TS files\r\nbut the `tsconfig.app.json` will be used for HTML files since it comes first and we cannot\r\neffectively express `projectContainsInfoDirectly` for HTML files.\r\n\r\nWe could consider also updating the language server implementation to attempt\r\nto select the project to use for the template file based on which project\r\ncontains its component file directly, using either the internal `project.projectContainsInfoDirectly`\r\nor as a workaround, check `project.isRoot(componentTsFile)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, keeping the projects open is hugely important in the solution style config case like\r\nNx. When a TS file is opened, TypeScript will only retain `tsconfig.editor.json` and not\r\n`tsconfig.app.json`. However, if our extension does not also know to select\r\n`tsconfig.editor.json`, it will automatically select `tsconfig.app.json` since it is defined\r\nfirst in the `tsconfig.json` file. So we need to teach TS server that we are (1) interested in\r\nkeeping projects open when there is an HTML file open and (2) optionally attempt to do this\r\n_only_ for projects that we know the TS language service will prioritize in TS files (i.e.,\r\nattempt to only keep `tsconfig.editor.json` open and allow `tsconfig.app.json` to close)\r\nand prioritize that project for all requests.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/1623\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/876\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45601","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(language-service): Add resource files as roots to their associate…\" (#45601)"},{"Id":"1201051307","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-12T04:53:46","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"45597","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): deprecate no longer needed `resolver` fields","State":"open","Body":"DEPRECATED:\r\n\r\nThe `resolver` argument of the `RouterOutletContract.activateWith` function and the `resolver` field of the `OutletContext` class are deprecated.

The `aotSummaries` fields in TestBed APIs were present, but unused. The fields were deprecated in previous major version and in v14 those fields are removed. The `aotSummaries` fields were completely unused, so you can just drop them from the TestBed APIs usage.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [598b759d33](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/598b759d33221cc2bbfad4895ca0d2499a0547f8) | fix | avoid errors with extremely long instruction chains ([#&#8203;45574](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45574)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [9add714b13](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9add714b13740db621eb2b200d72be74cc7eb630) | refactor | remove deprecated `aotSummaries` fields in TestBed config ([#&#8203;45487](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45487)) |\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\n4javier, Andrew Kushnir, Andrew Scott, Dylan Hunn, Jason Hendee, Jessica Janiuk, Kristiyan Kostadinov, Michael-Doner, Michal Materowski and Virginia Dooley\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v14.0.0-next.12`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next12-2022-04-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.11...14.0.0-next.12)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### forms\n\n-   Forms classes accept a generic.\n\n    Forms model classes now accept a generic type parameter.

Alternatively, for linting they have to run `ng lint` to get ESLint installed, but none of the tools comes by default.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo better inform developers about the integrations we provide, we can update our setup experience.

[`v0.14.36`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01436)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.35...v0.14.36)\n\n-   Revert path metadata validation for now ([#&#8203;2177](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2177))\n\n    This release reverts the path metadata validation that was introduced in the previous release. This validation has uncovered a potential issue with how esbuild handles `onResolve` callbacks in plugins that will need to be fixed before path metadata validation is re-enabled.\n\n### [`v0.14.35`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01435)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.34...v0.14.35)\n\n-   Add support for parsing `typeof` on #private fields from TypeScript 4.7 ([#&#8203;2174](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2174))\n\n    The upcoming version of TypeScript now lets you use `#private` fields in `typeof` type expressions:\n\n    https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#typeof-on-private-fields\n\n    ```ts\n    class Container {\n      #data = \"hello!\";\n\n      get data(): typeof this.#data {\n        return this.#data;\n      }\n\n      set data(value: typeof this.#data) {\n        this.#data = value;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild can now parse these new type expressions as well. This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Add Opera and IE to internal CSS feature support matrix ([#&#8203;2170](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2170))\n\n    Version 0.14.18 of esbuild added Opera and IE as available target environments, and added them to the internal JS feature support matrix. CSS feature support was overlooked, however. This release adds knowledge of Opera and IE to esbuild's internal CSS feature support matrix:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a {\n      color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:rgba(0,0,0,.5)}\n\n    /* New output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:#&#8203;00000080}\n    ```\n\n    The fix for this issue was contributed by [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red).\n\n-   Change TypeScript class field behavior when targeting ES2022\n\n    TypeScript 4.3 introduced a breaking change where class field behavior changes from assign semantics to define semantics when the `target` setting in `tsconfig.json` is set to `ESNext`. Specifically, the default value for TypeScript's `useDefineForClassFields` setting when unspecified is `true` if and only if `target` is `ESNext`. TypeScript 4.6 introduced another change where this behavior now happens for both `ESNext` and `ES2022`. Presumably this will be the case for `ES2023` and up as well. With this release, esbuild's behavior has also been changed to match. Now configuring esbuild with `--target=es2022` will also cause TypeScript files to use the new class field behavior.\n\n-   Validate that path metadata returned by plugins is consistent\n\n    The plugin API assumes that all metadata for the same path returned by a plugin's `onResolve` callback is consistent. Previously this assumption was just assumed without any enforcement. Starting with this release, esbuild will now enforce this by generating a build error if this assumption is violated. The lack of validation has not been an issue (I have never heard of this being a problem), but it still seems like a good idea to enforce it. Here's a simple example of a plugin that generates inconsistent `sideEffects` metadata:\n\n    ```js\n    let buggyPlugin = {\n      name: 'buggy',\n      setup(build) {\n        let count = 0\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /^react$/ }, args => {\n          return {\n            path: require.resolve(args.path),\n            sideEffects: count++ > 0,\n          }\n        })\n      },\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Since esbuild processes everything in parallel, the set of metadata that ends up being used for a given path is essentially random since it's whatever the task scheduler decides to schedule first. Thus if a plugin does not consistently provide the same metadata for a given path, subsequent builds may return different results. This new validation check prevents this problem.\n\n    Here's the new error message that's shown when this happens:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] [plugin buggy] Detected inconsistent metadata for the path \"node_modules/react/index.js\" when it was imported here:\n\n            button.tsx:1:30:\n              1 │ import { createElement } from 'react'\n                ╵                               ~~~~~~~\n\n          The original metadata for that path comes from when it was imported here:\n\n            app.tsx:1:23:\n              1 │ import * as React from 'react'\n                ╵                        ~~~~~~~\n\n          The difference in metadata is displayed below:\n\n           {\n          -  \"sideEffects\": true,\n          +  \"sideEffects\": false,\n           }\n\n          This is a bug in the \"buggy\" plugin. Plugins provide metadata for a given path in an \"onResolve\"\n          callback. All metadata provided for the same path must be consistent to ensure deterministic\n          builds. Due to parallelism, one set of provided metadata will be randomly chosen for a given path,\n          so providing inconsistent metadata for the same path can cause non-determinism.\n\n-   Suggest enabling a missing condition when `exports` map fails ([#&#8203;2163](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2163))\n\n    This release adds another suggestion to the error message that happens when an `exports` map lookup fails if the failure could potentially be fixed by adding a missing condition. Here's what the new error message looks like (which now suggests `--conditions=module` as a possible workaround):\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"@&#8203;sentry/electron/main\"\n\n            index.js:1:24:\n              1 │ import * as Sentry from '@&#8203;sentry/electron/main'\n                ╵                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          The path \"./main\" is not currently exported by package \"@&#8203;sentry/electron\":\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:8:13:\n              8 │   \"exports\": {\n                ╵              ^\n\n          None of the conditions provided (\"require\", \"module\") match any of the currently active conditions\n          (\"browser\", \"default\", \"import\"):\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:16:14:\n              16 │     \"./main\": {\n                 ╵               ^\n\n          Consider enabling the \"module\" condition if this package expects it to be enabled.

It looks like the intent in this case was to use the standard `import` condition instead. This specific change wasn't suggested here because this error message is for package consumers, not package authors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine-npm</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/compare/v4.0.2...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.0.1...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.0`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.8.0...v5.9.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **web:** add a config item to web，let the developer can select whether enable the html cache ([#&#8203;3110](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3110)) ([b30ba81](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b30ba81b86d3fa11a18bdb32a7adf162f16794e0))\n\nVerdaccio cache the initial HTML render to improve performance, this might be not a required in some cases, the new property `web.html_cache`  disable this optimization. by [@&#8203;Tiny-Fendy](https://togithub.com/Tiny-Fendy)\n\n    web:\n      html_cache: false\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **deps:** update dependency [@&#8203;verdaccio/ui-theme](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/ui-theme) to v6.0.0-6-next.23 ([#&#8203;3106](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3106)) ([b963f7d](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b963f7db2a2273983c0d5b4792a84601be732823)) by [@&#8203;juanpicado](https://togithub.com/juanpicado)\n\n> The UI is being shared between V5 and V6 (for easy maintenance) but some features are partially enabled for V5.\n\nThe search component has been improved for V6, but for V5 is does not show all the potential but is able to display the description of the package and the **latest** published version on search private packages.

Some max_old_space_size settings automatically crashed before the upgrade, but now I can't serve or build my app at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nIn V12.2.9, I could serve and build my app with 10gb or more of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, I have gone from 12.2.9 and being able to serve and build my app without issue to 13.3.2 and not being able to serve or build my app with up to 40gb of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have either gotten a mixture of scavenge and mark-sweep related messages about the JavaScript heap or when using multiples of 8gb (8192, 16384) and a couple other random memory limits, I get this error (with no other information):\r\n`<--- Last few GCs --->\r\n\r\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Fatal javascript OOM in GC during deserialization\r\n#`\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly small sized app (<60mb w/o node modules) with a large amount of processing power. There's almost no starting data, but it pulls in large amounts of data (manufacturing schedules in up to 5 year horizons; average of 35 designs per scenario; 13 data parameters per design) and performs analysis and utilizes Excel libraries (mostly Infragistics) for display.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI am and have been running with `node --max_old_space_size=10240 --report-on-fatalerror node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng s -o` (up to 40000). I would suggest that a small app with a lot of processing power built in 12.2.9 and then upgraded to 13.3.2 would reproduce this issue. It may require using some Infragistics components (data-grid, spreadsheet, chart), but I'm not sure since I've had IG in my build since I started it about 1.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nMy

Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI upgraded a big project to have ssr and the app loads properly in the browser, but on the server there are a lot of console errors about unmatched routes. All of them have to do with `.js.map` files it seems. Like `input.js.map`, `clipboard.js.map`, `ngrx-store-localstorage.js.map` and other .map files from the libraries used in the project. I thought at first it was an express-engine related error that it can't match requests for those lib files, but I added `server.use((err, req, res, next) => { console.error('err :)');  });` to the server and it is never called, furthermore the text in the error is very \"angular\" like.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe project is too big and tight together to extract and reproduce with any similar results.

The changes were largely informed by implementing `material/dialog`, `material-experimental/mdc-dialog` and `material/bottom-sheet` using the new API, however the API can be used directly without having to be wrapped. Overview of the changes:\r\n* The classes for the dialog container, dialog config and dialog data aren't provided using DI anymore. The previous approach could've been a problem for apps that use multiple different versions of a CDK-based dialog.\r\n* Several fixes from the Material dialog that were never backported to the CDK version have been incorporated.\r\n* All animations and styles have been removed from the CDK dialog since they were going to be difficult to override by users. Custom animations can be achieved by extending the dialog container class.\r\n* The public API has been cleaned up to avoid some of the issues that were inherited from the Material dialog.\r\n* A demo has been added to the dev app.\r\n\r\nExample of how the new APIs was used to implement the Material components: https://github.com/crisbeto/material2/commit/446a5520f1a0357612a9cc2d9e0c38b506665fb9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24759","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/dialog): rewrite experimental dialog\" (#24759)"},{"Id":"1199133300","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-10T18:25:26","Actor":"Michael-Doner","Number":"24758","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): fix slider jumps back while dragging","State":"open","Body":"Fix a bug in the Angular Material `slider` component where slider jumps back while the user is dragging the slider and the sliders value gets updated manually somewhere else at the same time.\r\n\r\nFixes #19842\r\n\r\nI saw the issue and I thought I'd tackle it, @crisbeto had also worked on it a long time ago, but there was no pull request merged yet if I see it correctly and since then something has changed in the code a bit.

was not present was\n\n13.2.6\n\n### Description\n\nWe have a tabcontrol with 2 tabs.\r\nThe first tab had some input fields I give focus.\r\n\r\nThen after like a full second orso, the tabcontrol steals the focus back, and the first header of the first tabs becomes the active htmlelement on the page.\r\nTherefor I cannot properly set focus on my input element.\r\n\r\nI am not very familiair

Reproduction\n\nHard to reproduce. In a simple example it seems to work.\r\n\r\nIn a our application it doens't.\r\n\r\nDifferences are perhaps we have a tabgroup with 2 tabs. Both of the tabs contain a control.\r\nthe first control contains a form with the input field.\r\n\r\nI have a screenshot that could explain a lot about what i think is wrong:\r\nhttps://snipboard.io/EtQguw.jpg\r\n\r\nAs you can see I have a method in the component of the first tab.\r\nIt focusses on the input field, and registers a 'blur' handler. Which triggers moments after we set the focus.\r\nIn the callstack you can see the problem. I just don't know what triggers it..\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect components to not steal focus, or if they do have an event that says 'now i'm done stealing focus'\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nafter all the events of the tabgroup are done, something triggers a focus steal.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material:13.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(tabcontrol): tabcontrol (the header) steals focus since 13.3.0\" (#24748)"},{"Id":"1195498371","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-07T04:18:04","Actor":"ducvu212","Number":"24746","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Cannot use material components inside remote project which created by nx","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have a project which use Microfrontend architecture by NX. \r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAfter i create remote project by command `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:app dashboard --mfe --mfeType=host --routing=true`\r\nInside project dashboard i generate component by using command `nx g c list`\r\nAfter that, i copy example in material home page (https://material.angular.io/components/list/overview#list-overview) but it show error \r\n`error NG8001: 'mat-list-item' is not a known element:\r\n1.

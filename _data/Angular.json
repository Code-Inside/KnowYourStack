This started happening as we updated Babel via https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49914.\r\n\r\nAside from other regressions in compliance output due to the tests not running, the real mapping errors surface a real issue where it's not yet quite clear whether we need to adjust or Babel introduced a bug.\r\n\r\nI've investigated this deeply and digged into internals of Babel and have a good understanding of the source map generation when translating AST to text. Let's have a look at one failure.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ni0.elementStart(<..>) // should map to `<div>`\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now **this is broken** and the mapping points to a totally unrelated source span. At first glance, this seems magical and it's unclear why this is happening. Debugging the linker Babel ast factory and host, it turns out that we are actually properly trying to set the source map information for e.g. `CallExpressions` to `elementStart`- still with the right offsets.\r\n\r\nAn initial assumption was that we somehow regressed/broke our source map flattening in ngtsc. Something that is non-trivial to understand very easy to break. I've tried to look directly at the intermediary sources, instead of relying on the flattened source map- and the incorrect mappings were still visible. Hence the flattening is not the culprit.\r\n\r\nGoing deeper, with more reversing of Babel's generator/traversal- I've assumed that somehow the printer is not picking up our source map information. e.g. `node.loc` may no longer be correct. Turns out this is still the valid field- so our logic is correct. Going further, I noticed that the traversal and state of \"current source span\" (it's a shared state in the AST printer in Babel) is unexpectedly reset in node traversal. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCallExpression -- // <div>\r\n     -> MemberExpression\r\n            -> i0 // some other span\r\n            -> elementStart\r\n```\r\n\r\nBabel basically sets the span for the call expression, but then when the call expression is printed, it goes deeper into the member expression -> then the core import. The core import then causes another span to become the \"current source span\" but never is reset to the parent span when the we go up the tree again (in-order printing). This then results in the mapping to be incorrect. Everything after `i0` ends up following the source span of the core import and the actual `CallExpression` source span is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis started happening with https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/4f4b450f5279947c24eae37b97dc8b5e652fcf51#diff-192a3f85cae6c8a5d19e16b083d4c421b517650b00a0e8ae10cf80cb1ce7d941R590. Previously the source spans were always reset to the previous ones, when e.g. a child node completed printing.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. visit CallExpression \r\n2. set span to `<div>`\r\n3. visit MemberExpression\r\n4. visit core import\r\n5. set span to X\r\n6. print core import\r\n7. set span back to previous `<div>`\r\n8. visit & print rest of member expressions)\r\n9. visit & print arguments (all using the still active `<div>` mapping)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible fixes**:\r\n\r\n* Consider working with Babel to see if the changes actually make sense. It seems odd that a child node AST location would affect the source mappings from a higher-level source mapping that spans over the rest of children. The granularity introduced seems acceptable- but also not sure about size here. In either case the locations seem wrong.\r\n\r\n* Ensure the import does not have a span. I determined the import always has a span because we are re-using the original AST node from the `ngImport` field of partial declarations. We **cannot** should likely not do this in the translator as that one is agnostic to e.g. Babel/TS AST.\r\n\r\n* Keep the source span for the import, but instead make sure that the followed printed text of the call expression (`i0.elementStart(xxx)`) has the proper span to the HTML source \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nHere is a

Looking at Angular changelogs, it is unclear if TypeScript 3.4 support was dropped in Angular 8.2.0. However, it is clear that both TypeScript 3.4 and 3.5 support was dropped in Angular 9.0.0.\r\n\r\nThe *Version compatibility* guide is missing an upper version range for the Angular 8.2.x + Angular CLI 8.2.x entry.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/versions#before-v9\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nI was looking for the supported versions of TypeScript in an Angular 8.x application.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n- The Angular 8.2.x + Angular CLI 8.2.x entry lists TypeScript support as `>=3.4.2` (notice no upper limit)\r\n- The Angular 8.2.x + Angular CLI 8.3.x entry lists TypeScript support as `>= 3.5.3 <3.6.0` - is TypeScript 3.4.x not supported by this combination?\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n- An upper limit on the Angular 8.2.x + Angular CLI 8.2.x entry's TypeScript version range\r\n- Clarification on whether TypeScript 3.5 support was dropped in Angular 8.2.x and Angular CLI 8.2.x or 8.3.x\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n<img width=\"493\" alt=\"Angular 8.x version compatibility matrix\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/6364586/70a4ba50-6c00-4dcc-8852-074b2c9cd2a9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\nMy original work in https://gist.github.com/LayZeeDK/c822cc812f75bb07b7c55d07ba2719b3 suggests that Angular CLI 8.3.x only supports TypeScript 3.5.x.

dev server (or similar extensibility)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nWith the goal to move off the Webpack-based development server, we have a need to port some of the functionality currently supported by the `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` module.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we would like the ability to add custom middlewares to the dev server. In our case, this would be used to inject a connect-compatible middleware that acts as a means of providing authenticated access to proxied endpoints, by setting session cookies used for authorization.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nVite's dev server currently supports proxy endpoints via an embedded `http-proxy` module, and provides documentation on [customizing with additional middlewares](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-proxy):\r\n\r\n> In some cases, you might also want to configure the underlying dev server (e.g. to add custom middlewares to the internal [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) app). In order to do that, you need to write your own [plugin](https://vitejs.dev/guide/using-plugins) and use [configureServer](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin#configureserver) function.\r\n\r\nThe `configureServer` method exposes the custom middleware hook:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myPlugin = () => ({\r\n  name: 'configure-server',\r\n  configureServer(server) {\r\n    server.middlewares.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n      // custom handle request...\r\n    })\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nExposing direct access to the Vite API may not align with the philosophy of the Angular CLI, but supporting the extensibility via custom builders would make these use cases feasible.\r\n\r\nI see similar requests in other issues such as https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24163 and https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/issues/1288\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I'm very excited to see CLI's build process move over to Vite; I've been using it outside Angular, and have given talks about how much I've enjoyed it: https://steele.blue/vite-is-neat/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"vite - Expose ability to add middlewares to Vite dev server (or similar extensibility)\" (#25777)"},{"Id":"1881364488","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-04T12:28:08","Actor":"Spiler98","Number":"25781","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't find my library's code in browser's dev tools","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have an application and a separate library that I use.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0-next.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next2-2023-08-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/17.0.0-next.1...17.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` default value is now `true`.

Single toggle button instances are meeting accessibility requirements because they have a change in text or icon in addition to color.\r\n\r\nSee WCAG context below:\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): “This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast.” \r\nThis success criterion is met, but is only applicable to the default (un-selected) state.\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\nThis is not being met. \r\n\r\nWCAG [Use of color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color): If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue, but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.\r\nThis implies that a design solution that meets 3:1 contrast is sufficient in meeting the “Use of Color” success criterion.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the component demo and does not require StackBlitz: https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe contrast ratio of the selected state must meet at least 3:1 to fulfill WCAG success criterion for non-text contrast and use of color.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCurrently the selected state of mat-button-toggle-group uses a fill color of #E0E0E0. On an #FFFFFF background, the contrast ratio is only 1.32:1. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular/Material 16.2.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button-toggle-group): Accessibility issue of WCAG non-text contrast and WCAG use of color\" (#27748)"},{"Id":"1875065745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T15:10:20","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27746","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: omit repetitions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27746","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: omit repetitions\" (#27746)"},{"Id":"1875320398","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T11:15:53","Actor":"omerman","Number":"27747","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using BreakpointObserver to set behaviors(props/style) to components it will often flicker on first reload especially once the window loads for the first time / when using ssr.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that using media queries for example will look perfect vs using BreakpointObserver to achieve the same things.\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to deal with that?\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\n\r\n(If it looks like Im coming too strong, it's because it is frustrating, but really I do appreciate the hard work given on this framework)\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. generate this example on an angular project `ng generate @angular/material:navigation <component-name>`\r\n2. open browser with 400px size(width)\r\n3. refresh the example\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf you hide/show the relevant components using media query, it will just work. no flicker.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to just work smoothly, and if it's a caveat I would expect some sort of implemented behavior/way to help us overcome this. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nYou will see the component of the sidenav flicker for a second.\r\nAlso the simple nav button  will flicker\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: latest\r\n- CDK/Material: latest\r\n- Browser(s): chrome latest\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27747","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic\" (#27747)"},{"Id":"1875062568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T08:42:14","Actor":"Milad-Mohamadi","Number":"27745","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(mat-menu): Change menu item direction in RTL","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a bug in the Angular Material component where menu items did not update dynamically upon a direction change.

Open the example at https://building-tooltip-ovwh6v.stackblitz.io/ in a mobile browser (tried on Pixel 7 and iPhone 13).\r\n2. Scroll down until the address bar is removed, but the button still has enough room on top to display a tooltip.\r\n3. Hover over or click the tooltip button located at the bottom of the page.\r\n4. The tooltip that should appear above the button is displayed in the wrong position.\r\n5. Scrolling to the top moves the tooltip to the correct location.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe tooltip should appear in the correct location, even when the address bar is hidden on a mobile browser.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn mobile browsers, when using a position strategy with `overlayY: 'bottom'` for a tooltip, the tooltip's location becomes incorrect when the address bar is hidden.

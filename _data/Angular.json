Effect not found:', effectName);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    this.animateLeave = (event: AnimationCallbackEvent) => {\n      effect(event.target).eventCallback('onComplete', () => event.animationComplete());\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\nThen templates become as simple as CSS-class-like bindings:\n\n```html\n<div animateEnterGsap=\"fade-in\" animateLeaveGsap=\"fade-out\">\n   ...\n</div>\n```\n\n**No more boilerplate.**\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow directives/components to attach animation lifecycle handlers on the host via a decorator or host metadata, similar to DOM events:\n```ts\n@HostBinding('(animate.enter)')\nanimationCallbackFunction: (event: AnimationCallbackEvent) => void;\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo good alternatives. The only current option is to bind (animate.enter) / (animate.leave) in every template where the component/directive is used, which scales poorly and scatters animation wiring across templates.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide hostbinding for (animate.enter) and (animate.leave) events\" (#63199)"},{"Id":"3327679207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-16T21:42:55","Actor":"olfek","Number":"63198","RawContent":null,"Title":"There is no way to customize the service worker","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/tree/3f88fbdfa762430cb9110ec0e3a39ba0ed3d8dec/packages/service-worker/worker/src\n\nRelevant Google search - https://www.google.com/search?q=angular+customize+ngsw-worker.js+site:stackoverflow.com\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSomething similar to the web workers integration perhaps?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63198","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"There is no way to customize the service worker\" (#63198)"},{"Id":"3327602178","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-16T20:06:04","Actor":"akib1997","Number":"63197","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): add paths for constants and missing link","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The Karma runner is now marked as `isStandalone: true` to indicate that it manages its own build process.

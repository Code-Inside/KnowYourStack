**fix support for using an `Intl.Segmenter` with `diffWords`**. This has been almost completely broken since the feature was added in v6.0.0, since it would outright crash on any text that featured two consecutive newlines between a pair of words (a very common case).\n- [#&#8203;635](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/635) - **small tweaks to tokenization behaviour of `diffWords`** when used *without* an `Intl.Segmenter`. Specifically, the soft hyphen (U+00AD) is no longer considered to be a word break, and the multiplication and division signs (`×` and `÷`) are now treated as punctuation instead of as letters / word characters.\n- [#&#8203;641](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/641) - **the format of file headers in `createPatch` etc. patches can now be customised somewhat**. It now takes a `headerOptions` option that can be used to disable the file headers entirely, or omit the `Index:` line and/or the underline. In particular, this was motivated by a request to make jsdiff patches compatible with react-diff-view, which they now are if produced with `headerOptions: FILE_HEADERS_ONLY`.\n- [#&#8203;647](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/647) and [#&#8203;649](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649) - **fix denial-of-service vulnerabilities in `parsePatch` whereby adversarial input could cause a memory-leaking infinite loop, typically crashing the calling process**. Also fixed ReDOS vulnerabilities whereby adversarially-crafted patch headers could take cubic time to parse. Now, `parsePatch` should reliably take linear time. (Handling of headers that include the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` in non-trailing positions is also now more reasonable as side effect of the fix.)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi43My4wIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuNzMuMCIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6Im1haW4iLCJsYWJlbHMiOlsiYWN0aW9uOiBtZXJnZSIsImFyZWE6IGJ1aWxkICYgY2kiLCJ0YXJnZXQ6IGF1dG9tYXRpb24iXX0=-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66571","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies (main)\" (#66571)"},{"Id":"3818476663","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-15T17:31:25","Actor":"purplefrizzel","Number":"66592","RawContent":null,"Title":"[signal forms] FormField directive does not work with host directives inputs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen creating custom form controls using a host directive that implements the FormValueControl interface and exposes shared inputs, the associated FormField directive no longer propagates input updates (for example, required and disabled) to the control.\n\nThis behaviour worked as expected in Angular Forms v21.0.1, but appears to have regressed in v21.0.8.\n\nUsing host directives to expose and share inputs across components is a common pattern in our codebase. The current behaviour prevents this pattern from working correctly and represents a regression from previous releases. Restoring this functionality would be highly beneficial, as it is relied upon extensively.\n\nA minimal, stripped-down reproduction of this use case is provided below.\n\n**Our directive**\n```typescript\n// imports....\n\n@Directive({\n    standalone: true,\n    exportAs: 'isFormControl',\n})\nexport class IsFormControlDirective<ValueType = any> implements

readOnly: InputSignal<boolean> = input<boolean>(false);\n\n    public readonly touched: ModelSignal<boolean> = model<boolean>(false);\n\n   // continues.....\n}\n```\n\n**custom control

code.","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI was trying to setup `monaco-editor` using the ESM version.\n\nI managed to setup the `monaco-editor` web workers and it seamed to work mostly fine. However when I built the app using the application builder, the monaco *.css files were not loaded. Fortunately, there is a bundle with the styles in the AMD version that I was able to include in the application. Non the less, I am concerned that these will soon be removed, since the AMD version is deprecated, and we will no longer be able to use monaco with angular.\n\nAfter managing this problems, I was testing the built code and it seams the generated minified code does not match the development code and breaks.\n\nThis is the original monaco code:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n    for await(const item of this._asyncIterable) {\n        if (item) {\n            this._result.push(item);\n            this._fireResult(options);\n        }\n    }\n    this._asyncIterableDone = true;\n    if (this._state === 3 /* HoverOperationState.WaitingForAsync */\n    || this._state === 4 /* HoverOperationState.WaitingForAsyncShowingLoading */\n    ) {\n        this._setState(0 /* HoverOperationState.Idle */\n        , options);\n    }\n} catch (e) {\n    onUnexpectedError(e);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the unminified generated code:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n  try {\n    for (var iter = __forAwait(this._asyncIterable), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n      const item = temp.value;\n      if (item) {\n        this._result.push(item);\n        this._fireResult(options);\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (temp) {\n    error = [temp];\n  } finally {\n    try {\n      more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n    } finally {\n      if (error)\n        throw error[0];\n    }\n  }\n  this._asyncIterableDone = true;\n  if (this._state === 3 || this._state === 4) {\n    this._setState(0, options);\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  onUnexpectedError(e);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the minified code:\n```ts\ntry {\n    try {\n        for (var t = fs(this._asyncIterable), i, n, s; i = !(n = yield t.next()).done; i = !1) {\n            let r = n.value;\n            r && (this._result.push(r),\n            this._fireResult(e))\n        }\n    } catch {\n        s = [n]\n    } finally {\n        try {\n            i && (n = t.return) && (yield n.call(t))\n        } finally {\n            if (s)\n                throw s[0]\n        }\n    }\n    this._asyncIterableDone = !0,\n    (this._state === 3 || this._state === 4) && this._setState(0, e)\n} catch (r) {\n    ye(r)\n}\n```\n\nThere is an important difference between the development code and production code:\n```ts\ncatch {\n    s = [n]\n}\n\ncatch (temp) {\n  error = [temp];\n}\n```\n\nThe `n` variable is never assigned and is undefined, giving an error later on in the code.\n\nCan we also address the fact *.css files are correctly loaded with vite in the development server and not using the application builder? The css is bundled but there is no code importing it.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Install monaco-editor\n2. Build the application in production,\n3. Check the generated chunks.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI       : 21.1.0\nAngular           : 21.1.0\nNode.js           : 24.12.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.6.2\nOperating System  : linux x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                           │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/animations               │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/build                    │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/cli                      │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/common                   │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler                 │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli             │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/core                     │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/forms                    │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/localize                 │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser         │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser-dynamic │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/router                   │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ @angular/service-worker           │ 21.1.0            │ ^21.1.0           │\n│ ng-packagr                        │ 21.0.1            │ ^21.0.1           │\n│ rxjs                              │ 7.8.2             │ ~7.8.2            │\n│ typescript                        │ 5.9.3             │ ^5.9.3            │\n│ vitest                            │ 4.0.17            │ ^4.0.8            │\n│ zone.js                           │ 0.16.0            │ 0.16.0            │\n└───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32298","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Builder produces wrong minified code.\" (#32298)"},{"Id":"3813867892","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-14T21:52:37","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32290","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): decouple `AnalyticsCollector` from `CommandContext`","State":"closed","Body":"The `AnalyticsCollector` class is made more modular and easier to test by removing its direct dependency on the `CommandContext`.

dependency.\n\n- It is for an experimental feature (see docs at https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3f13db87e27f6ffc207fc642979776606a71fcec/adev/src/content/ai/develop-with-ai.md?plain=1#L34C1-L34C41).\n- It involves code to start a local server so is inherently more risky.\n- It requires specific setup outside of the Angular CLI (a given local AI tool needs the MCP endpoint configuring)\n\nPlease change this so that we reduce bloat and security

Likely a source-map quirk. Similar issue exists, but note: on Node 22 (V8 12.x) coverage is correct; on Node 24 (V8 13.6) phantom branches appear.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create project: `npx @angular/cli@21.0.5 new coverage-v8`\n2. Add coverage provider: `npm i -D @vitest/coverage-v8`\n3. Update angular.json test options:\n```\n\"options\": {\n  \"coverage\": true\n}\n```\n4. Run tests: `npm run test`\nCoverage summary shows **91.66%** in app.ts **instead of 100%**. It reports **11/12 branches covered**; the uncovered branch is on the line where the signal is defined.\n\n_Note: On Node 22 (V8 12.x), this works flawlessly. The incorrect coverage appears on Node 24 (V8 13.x)._\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.5\nAngular           : 21.0.8\nNode.js           : 24.13.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.6.2\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                   │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/build            │ 21.0.5            │ ^21.0.5           │\n│ @angular/cli              │ 21.0.5            │ ^21.0.5           │\n│ @angular/common           │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler         │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli     │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/core             │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/forms            │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/router           │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ rxjs                      │ 7.8.2             │ ~7.8.0            │\n│ typescript                │ 5.9.3             │ ~5.9.2            │\n│ vitest                    │ 4.0.17            │ ^4.0.8            │\n└───────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32283","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Incorrect branch coverage with Vitest on Node 24 (V8 13.6)\" (#32283)"},{"Id":"3811729965","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-14T07:34:16","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32285","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency node to v22.22.0 (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| [node](https://nodejs.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node)) | minor | `22.21.1` → `22.22.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/node (node)</summary>\n\n### [`v22.22.0`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.22.0): 2026-01-13, Version 22.22.0 &#x27;Jod&#x27; (LTS), @&#8203;marco-ippolito\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/compare/v22.21.1...v22.22.0)\n\nThis is a security release.\n\n##### Notable Changes\n\nlib:\n\n- (CVE-2025-59465) add TLSSocket default error handler\n- (CVE-2025-55132) disable futimes when permission model is enabled\n  lib,permission:\n- (CVE-2025-55130) require full read and write to symlink APIs\n  src:\n- (CVE-2025-59466) rethrow stack overflow exceptions in async\\_hooks\n  src,lib:\n- (CVE-2025-55131) refactor unsafe buffer creation to remove zero-fill toggle\n  tls:\n- (CVE-2026-21637) route callback exceptions through error handlers\n\n##### Commits\n\n- \\[[`6badf4e6f4`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/6badf4e6f4)] -

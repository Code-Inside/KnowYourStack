When the project is built, the problem does not occur.**\n\nI'd like to inform you about a problem I've encountered after updating to Angular 19. When navigating from one view to another and back, I've noticed a flickering effect related to the styles of a specific component. As the component loads, it appears without any styles for a split second before the styles are applied and everything returns to normal.\n\nThis issue did not occur in Angular 18.\n\nHow to reproduce the problem:\n\nCreate a new project in Angular 19.\nCreate two routable components, e.g., view1 and view2.\nAdd HTML elements to each component, such as `<h1>, <p>`, and a <button> with a routerLink navigating between view1 and view2.\nAdd styles to these components, like background, font-size, etc.\nRun the application and navigate to the main page. If you refresh the page directly or using the refresh button, everything works correctly.\nNavigate using the button with routerLink to the second view and back. You'll notice that for a moment, the components are displayed without styles, and then the styles load.\n\nAdditional Information:\nBrowser: Google Chrome 131.0.6778.70\n\nExample in stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rb8wat\n\nSeems like this bug is bound to the HMR of stylesheets cause once built, there is no bug anymore.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rb8wat\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWhen navigating from one view to another and back, I've noticed a flickering effect related to the styles of a specific component. As the component loads, it appears without any styles for a split second before the styles are applied and everything returns to normal. As if there was a delay in loading the styles.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.3\nNode: 20.13.1\nNpm:

However, the runtime would previously not collect these link elements for reuse with rendered components. This would result in two copies of the link elements present in the DOM. In isolation this is not problematic as it is only present in development mode. Unfortunately, the Vite-based CSS HMR functionality used by the Angular CLI only updates the first stylesheet it finds and leaves other instances of the stylesheet in place. This behavior causes the styles to be left in an inconsistent state. This could be considered a defect within Vite as it should update all relevant styles to maintain consistency but ideally there should not be two instances in the Angular SSR case. To avoid the Vite issue, the runtime will now collect SSR generated external styles and reuse them.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59031","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(platform-browser): collect external component styles from server rendering\" (#59031)"},{"Id":"2716014904","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-03T21:30:34","Actor":"NateRadebaugh","Number":"59030","RawContent":null,"Title":"FormControl events should include when ValidatorFn is added/removed","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nI'd like to be able to show a required asterisk (`*`) when the `Validators.required` is added to the reactive forms control.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to get this information in any rxjs event or signal way.\n\nMy only workaround is to subscribe to `formControl.events`, but this ends up with extra noise and is not immediately triggered if changing from one invalid reason to another, etc.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n`AbstractControl<any, any>.events: Observable<ControlEvent<any>>` should be extended to include a `ValidatorsChangeEvent`\n\n```ts\nexport declare class ValidatorsChangeEvent extends ControlEvent {\n    readonly validators: ValidatorFn[];\n    readonly source: AbstractControl;\n    constructor(validators: ValidatorFn[], source: AbstractControl);\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe following doesn't work very well:\n\n```ts\nconst sub = formControl.events\n.pipe(\n  takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef),\n  map((x) => formControl.hasValidator(Validators.required)),\n  // only trigger when the value changes\n  distinctUntilChanged(\n    (a, b) => a === b,\n    (x) => x,\n  ),\n)\n.subscribe((isFormControlRequired) => {\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59030","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FormControl events should include when ValidatorFn is added/removed\" (#59030)"},{"Id":"2715669098","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-03T17:55:57","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"59029","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): update `effect` doc","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59029","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(core): update `effect` doc\" (#59029)"},{"Id":"2715491912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-03T16:35:49","Actor":"k-schneider","Number":"59028","RawContent":null,"Title":"NG02801 raised during unit tests even if withFetch() is provided","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon, core\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI have unit tests with a setup similar to:\n\n```typescript\nbeforeEach(() => {\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    providers: [\n      provideHttpClient(),\n      provideHttpClientTesting(),\n      {\n        provide: PLATFORM_ID,\n        useValue: \"server\",\n      }\n    ],\n  });\n});\n```\n\nWhen ran they emit this warning:\n\n```'NG02801: Angular detected that `HttpClient` is not configured to use `fetch` APIs.

This can be an expensive task especially considering the large amount of `.d.ts` files within packages. TypeScript supports using a cache of known `package.json` files to improve the performance of this task. The Angular CLI will now provide and reuse this cache across rebuilds during watch mode. This includes the use of `ng serve`.\r\n\r\nThe performance difference is most apparent for the Angular template diagnostic step of the build. Internally the Angular compiler creates a new template typechecking program which causes the `package.json` search process to occur. By leveraging the cache, this process becomes a series of cache hits. In the event that files are modified within the node modules directory, the cache is invalidated and the following rebuild may be longer as a result.\r\n\r\nPrevious:\r\n```\r\nDURATION[NG_DIAGNOSTICS_TOTAL]: 0.040498750s\r\nDURATION[NG_DIAGNOSTICS_SYNTACTIC]: 0.000079378s [count: 265; avg: 0.000000300s; min: 0.000000166s; max:

I have set that \"styles\" budget is `310.82kB`, but I get warning while building saying `styles failed to meet minimum budget. Budget 317.25 kB was not met by 6.44 kB with a total of 310.82 kB.`. \n\nAfter writing scripts to calculate these sizes myself, it seems that in version 18 with webpack builder, bytes where converted to `kB` with multiplier `1024`. With esbuild, it seems that `kB` sizes are calculated with multiplied `1000`. So when `stats.json` says `bytes: 34607`, you need to multiply it with 1000 to get the same size that `build` report gives \n\n```\nstyles-7LUPB3L5.css   | styles                            | 310.82 kB |                33.90 kB\npolyfills-4HAGG4WH.js | polyfills                         |  34.61 kB |                11.34 kB\n```\n\nBut then it gives warnings\n\n```\n▲ [WARNING] styles failed to meet minimum budget. Budget 317.25 kB was not met by 6.44 kB with a total of 310.82 kB.\n▲ [WARNING] polyfills failed to meet minimum budget. Budget 35.34 kB was not met by 728 bytes with a total of 34.61 kB.\n```\n\nMy `angular.json` has this\n\n```\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"bundle\",\n                  \"name\": \"styles\",\n                  \"baseline\": \"310.816kB\",\n                  \"warning\": \"1kB\",\n                  \"error\": \"100kB\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"bundle\",\n                  \"name\": \"polyfills\",\n                  \"baseline\": \"34.607kB\",\n                  \"warning\": \"0.1kB\",\n                  \"error\": \"5kB\"\n                },\n```\n\nSo I think those warnings are reported incorrectly. It seems that the values are taken from `angular.json` and then multiplied to get `317.25 kB` and `35.34 kB` when they should not be multiplied. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI can repro this with new Angular 19 app, which uses `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",`\n\nI added budget constraint to `angular.json`\n\n```\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"bundle\",\n                  \"name\": \"main\",\n                  \"baseline\": \"208.23kB\",\n                  \"warning\": \"1b\",\n                  \"error\": \"5kB\"\n                },\n```\n\nAfter which I get warning\n\n```\n❯ ng build\nInitial chunk files   | Names         |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nmain-IEYM3F25.js      | main          | 208.23 kB |                56.85 kB\npolyfills-FFHMD2TL.js | polyfills     |  34.52 kB |                11.28 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css   | styles        |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                      | Initial total | 242.75 kB |                68.13 kB\n\nApplication bundle generation complete.

Fix the logic so it works with Windows paths as well as unix paths.\r\n\r\nAs a drive-by fix, this also cleans up the deduped filenames so we get \"foo-2.spec.js\" instead of \"foo.spec-2.js\". The latter looked a bit confusing and it was just a tiiiiny regex to fix those names up. The index append shouldn't really come up in real code very often, so this is very much a tiny niche case.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28915","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29034","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): handle windows spec collisions\" (#29034)"},{"Id":"2714622076","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-03T16:24:39","Actor":"ihsnow","Number":"29029","RawContent":null,"Title":"deployUrl is added to absolute paths in link rel=preload tags","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\ndeployUrl is added to absolute paths in link rel=preload tags\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nPlease check:\n\n- angular 17: https://stackblitz.com/github/ihsnow/deploy-example-17/\n- angular 19: https://stackblitz.com/github/ihsnow/deploy-example-19/\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.11\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 17.3.12\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.11\n@angular/cli                    17.3.11\n@schematics/angular             17.3.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29029","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"deployUrl is added to absolute paths in link rel=preload tags\" (#29029)"},{"Id":"2715387887","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-03T16:24:38","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29032","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): avoid deploy URL usage on absolute preload links","State":"closed","Body":"The `deployUrl` option was unintentionally being prepended to preload links with absolute URLs within the generated index HTML for an appplication.

Watching for file changes...\nRe-optimizing dependencies because lockfile has changed\n  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4200/\n  ➜  press h + enter to show help\n```\n\nIt says its listening on localhost. \nLocalhost is resolving to both `::1` and `127.0.0.1`. Still ng decides to only listen on `::1`:\n```\nnetstat -pnlt | grep ':4200'\ntcp6       0      0 ::1:4200                :::*                    LISTEN      2145414/ng serve\n```\n\nI can force it to run it on IPv4 with binding to `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`, but then  it only listens to ipv4, and not 6 of course:\n```\nng serve --host 127.0.0.1\n\nnetstat -pnlt | grep ':4200'\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:4200          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2152537/ng serve --\n```\n\nStarting it explicitly with `localhost` also only binds it to IPv6:\n```\nng serve --host localhost\n\nnetstat -pnlt | grep ':4200'\ntcp6       0      0 ::1:4200                :::*                    LISTEN      2164254/ng serve --\n```\n\nIt seems like this \"issue\" is only reproducible on Linux, on Mac OSX, ng binds \"correctly\".\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.2\nNode: 20.9.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.1.0\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular:

The MFE is loaded into a shell, which I called mfe-login.\n\nThe problem is that when selecting an item, the mat-options do not appear. They only show up when I scroll, and even then, the dropdown does not disappear properly.\n\nAs you can see in the video below, there's a white vertical bar at the top of the page, and I believe the issue is related to the cdk-overlay-container. Has anyone else faced this issue? If so, how did you fix it?\n\nI've been trying to resolve this for a few days now and even attempted adjusting the z-index, though I consider that a bad practice, and it still didn't work.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78a9c3b5-cfbc-4f91-82b7-6eb2317f46ef\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to create a StackBlitz reproduction of this issue due to the complexity and size of the current project. I'm not sure if StackBlitz would support all the dependencies and configurations I've used in this project. However, I can provide any additional details or code snippets to help the team reliably reproduce the issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected the mat-select options to appear correctly when an item is selected. The dropdown should display the mat-options immediately without the need for scrolling, and the dropdown should close properly once an option is selected. There should be no unexpected visual artifacts, such as the white vertical bar at the top of the page.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen selecting an item from the mat-select, the mat-options do not appear immediately. They only become visible after scrolling, and even then, the dropdown does not close properly. Additionally, a white vertical bar appears at the top of the page, which I believe is related to the cdk-overlay-container.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: **18.2.0**\n- CDK/Material: **18.2.14**\n- Browser(s): \n   - **Brave** _Version 1.73.91 Chromium: 131.0.6778.85 (64-bit)_\n   - **Chrome** _Version 131.0.6778.85 (Official Build) (64-bit)_\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): **Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS**\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30112","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Problem with mat-select in MFE: Options not displaying correctly inside cdk-overlay-container\" (#30112)"},{"Id":"2707259086","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-30T11:34:47","Actor":"Sepandard","Number":"30108","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/theming): fix not found error in the guide duplicate theming styles document","State":"open","Body":"bring back the missing document\r\nresolves #30072\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30108","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/theming): fix not found error in the guide duplicate theming styles document\" (#30108)"},{"Id":"2705545515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-30T08:35:09","Actor":"KamranSohail619","Number":"30107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30107","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\" (#30107)"},{"Id":"2703087084","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T19:25:42","Actor":"therlaup","Number":"30102","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-slider): Slider thumb cannot be moved by dragging the track on iOS","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15.2.9\n\n### Description\n\nThe behavior of mat-slider components differs on iOS compared to other devices. On iOS, the thumb position is not updated when the finger touches down on the screen (i.e. \"touchstart\" event) if the track is touched. To move the thumb, a drag must start on the thumb itself. This makes it hard for users to drag the slider since they need to very precisely touch the thumb. However, if a pointer drag event starts on slider track (from a mouse or touchpad), then the thumb moves appropriately (i.e. mousedown or pointerdown event).\n\nWe've had several complains from our users on this topic and this is becoming a major issue for us. The sliders worked perfectly in version 15.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nA specific StackBlitz is not necessary as the behavor can be reproduced from https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Safari or Chrome on iOS and go to: https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n2. Using finger on touchscreen, drag the track of any of the sliders. The thumb does not move despite the ripple effect being triggered.\n3. Use a mouse or a touchpad to drag the track of any slider. The thumb moves with the drag.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe thumb position should update on touchstart event on the track. If you use v15.2.9 of the Angular material components (https://v15.material.angular.io/components/slider/overview), the dragging behavior works perfectly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iOS, the thumb position is not updated on touchstart event if the track is touched. To move the thumb, a drag must start on the thumb itself. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.0 to 19.0.0\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0 to 19.0.0\n- Browser(s): Safari or Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): iOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30102","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-slider): Slider thumb cannot be moved by dragging the track on iOS\" (#30102)"},{"Id":"2701771848","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T11:00:10","Actor":"endlacer","Number":"30101","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(drag-drop): New Optional Input [cdkDragStartPredicate]","State":"open","Body":"## Feature Request\n### Problem Statement\nCurrently, the CdkDrag directive doesn't provide a way to conditionally prevent drag operations from starting based on the initial mouse/touch event.

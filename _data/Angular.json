also, angular.dev is missing `aria-current` attributes for the active anchors)\n\nFor more context, there are two problems.\n\nFirst one is the fact the class is added / removed through a queued microtrask.  \nSecond is that at startup / hydration, a call to `router.isActive` will not be correct until the router has performed its first navigation internally...\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt depends greatly on what's the plan regarding Angular Routing in general...\nAs the team is working on turning many facets of old Angular into signals (Forms is another example), I guess Routing is in the works.\n\nI have opened the draft PR #62974 that removed the flicker for my internal project, but it probably has a bunch of issues...\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI guess copy-pasting the internal code done for angular.dev would work, but I would prefer to use something provided by `@angular/router`...","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62973","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Future of RouterLinkActive... signal-based and no flickering ?\" (#62973)"},{"Id":"3287253790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T15:01:15","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"62971","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add a `currentNavigation` signal to the `Router`","State":"open","Body":"This new signal property is convenient to derive a `isNavigating` state.\r\n\r\n`isNavigating = computed(() => !!this.router.currentNavigation())`\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: The `Router.getCurrentNavigation` method is deprecated.

Now that we have `animate.leave` in the framework, the aggressive pruning has the unintended side effect of removing the stylesheet that contains the defined animation styles. This ends up causing a weird behavior with the delayed element removal, styles disappearing, and then the element failing to be removed until the timeout fires. This can be solved by disabling the behavior with the `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` injection token. However, that's not ideal given that it leaves all stylesheets behind.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe ideal solution would be to delay the pruning of the stylesheets by the duration of the animation timeout and then prune them after. This essentially allows the animation to fire properly, leave the element looking right, and then remove. Alternatively, we could just always schedule pruning to happen a given duration after destroy.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` token is the only current workaround.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30820","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Delayed Stylesheet Pruning when animate.leave exists\" (#30820)"},{"Id":"3282574171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-01T07:09:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30817","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v5.9.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.8.3` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | resolutions | patch | [`5.9.1-rc` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.9.1-rc` -> `5.9.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/5.9.1-rc/5.9.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>microsoft/TypeScript (typescript)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.2`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v5.9.2): TypeScript 5.9\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/compare/ad825f2bee3362886d642c48cb97c82df82b3ddb...v5.9.2)\n\nRelease notes pending.\n\n<!-- For release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-9-rc/) -->\n\n- [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.9.0 (Beta)](https://redirect.github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.9.0%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n- [fixed issues query for Typescript 5.9.1 (RC)](https://redirect.github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=milestone%3A%22TypeScript+5.9.1%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n- \\[\\[No specific changes for TypeScript 5.9.2 (Stable)]]\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A chip has two slots to display icons using content projection. All variants of chips support adding icons including \\<mat-chip\\>, \\<mat-chip-option\\>, and \\<mat-chip-row\\>.\n\nThis suggests two possible slots for a `<mat-icon>` (leading or trailing the chip text). However, this doesn't work in practice, and looking at the [template code](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/chips/chip.html) suggests that the chip only supports an _avatar_ in the leading slot (despite the documentation stating \"icon\"). \n\nWhen you try to add an icon rather than an avatar, it's not aligned correctly. Adding the `matChipAvatar` directive doesn't help as the icon is clipped to a circle (and the alignment is still off).\n\nIn my opinion, a chip should support projecting an instance of `MatIcon` on the leading side (in fact, it's show in the [MD spec](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview)). However, as it stands the documentation is misleading as to the current behaviour.\n\n<img width=\"1360\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d002fc-7331-411d-97f4-8a918d063691\" />\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/gqzwx38r?file=src%2Fexample%2Fchips-avatar-example.html\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/chips/overview#adding-up-to-two-icons-with-content-projection","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): MatChip does not natively support leading icon despite docs\" (#31628)"},{"Id":"3279142506","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T05:09:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31626","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency firebase-tools to v14.11.2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [firebase-tools](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | devDependencies | patch | [`14.11.1` -> `14.11.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/14.11.1/14.11.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.11.2`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.11.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.11.1...v14.11.2)\n\n- Fixed ext:export command so that it correctly returns system params in the .env file ([#&#8203;8881](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/8881))\n- Fixed an issue where the MCP server could not successfully use Application Default Credentials.

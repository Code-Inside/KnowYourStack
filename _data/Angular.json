The app will typically crash on a \"missing\" code block because it cannot find said block.  However, the block DOES exist, but may have just been added amongst other changes.  The workaround is to modify the block again (by adding a comment or console.log), forcing a fresh reload.  Invariably, this will rectify the issue.\r\nWe upgraded from v11 to v14 a few months ago and it is believed the issue has been introduced since then.  At that time, however, we started restructuring the app by using modules and lazy loading, in case that's relevant somehow.\r\nI have been using Angular for many years and have not encountered this issue before.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\ncannot be reproduced outside our environment\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe browser dev console will typically throw an error like:\r\n\r\n`error TS2551: Property 'XYZ' does not exist on type 'MyService'.

Secondly, the hash strategy is a location configuration in `@angular/common` and you can use it outside of the Router or with any custom router implementations. So while the net effect of using the router is that it updates the URL which is controlled by the strategy, this feature provider doesn't necessarily need to exist in the Router. The location strategy is an application-wide configuration and affects anything that imports `Location`.  Of course, the Router does this in a few places but plenty of other things might as well.\r\n\r\nThe argument for this feature:\r\n\r\n* Discoverability. While `LocationStrategy` is technically in `@angular/common`, the most common use-case _is_ when using it with the Router.\r\n* Precedence in the `RouterModule.forRoot([], {useHash: true})`\r\n* Precedence in other routing libraries (`createWebHashHistory` in VueJS and `HashRouter` in React, for example)\r\n* The implementation of `withHashLocation` is much more clear than `useHash` was. You can look at the function and see that all it's doing is adding the `HashLocationStrategy` to the providers list.\r\n\r\nresolves #48295 / #47986","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48301","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): Add feature provider for enabling hash navigation\" (#48301)"},{"Id":"1469578274","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-30T17:34:21","Actor":"Lonli-Lokli","Number":"48295","RawContent":null,"Title":"`provideRouter`: there is no option for `useHash` or `errorHandler`","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nrouter\n\n### Description\n\nThere is no replacement for ExtraOptions with new `provideRouter`\r\neg \r\n```ts\r\nRouterModule.forRoot(APPLICATION_ROUTES, {\r\n        useHash: true,\r\n        errorHandler: (error: any) => console.error('Router Error Occured', error)\r\n      }),\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd new settings to Router config\r\n```ts\r\n provideRouter(APPLICATION_ROUTES, withRouterConfig({\r\n         useHash: true,\r\n        errorHandler: (error: any) => console.error('Router Error Occured', error)\r\n    })),\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNew `RouterFeatures` handler","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48295","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`provideRouter`: there is no option for `useHash` or `errorHandler`\" (#48295)"},{"Id":"1468236676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-30T17:28:04","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"48281","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove debug data structures","State":"closed","Body":"This commit removes several debug data structures from the framework runtime.

a `DateValueAccessor` that supported `input[type=date]`. Would be extra nice if we could also get similar accessors for `input[type=datetime-local]`, `input[type=time]`, `input[type=month]`  and others, though it's understandable if these are lower priority given that Firefox doesn't support them properly.

without creating the test.ts files","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nwith Angular 15, now the `test.ts` file doesn't get generated by default, so it's not an easy task to change the `TestBed` configurations for example to enable `errorOnUnknownElements`\r\nit will also be nice if we can change the pattern of the tests\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nto add the configurations inside the `angular.json` files in the options section of test\r\n\r\nsomething like\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"options\": {\r\n  \"polyfills\": [\r\n    \"zone.js\",\r\n    \"zone.js/testing\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\r\n  \"inlineStyleLanguage\": \"scss\",\r\n  \"assets\": [\r\n    \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n    \"src/assets\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"styles\": [\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"scripts\": [],\r\n  \"errorOnUnknownElements\": true,      <--- \r\n  \"errorOnUnknownProperties\": true,    <--- \r\n  \"pattern\": \"\\.custom-spec\\.ts$\"      <--- \r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nto be able to enable them globally from any script (to create a js file and add it to the scripts of the test) with something like\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetTestBed().setoptions({\r\n  errorOnUnknownElements: true,\r\n  errorOnUnknownProperties: true,\r\n  pattern: /\\.custom-spec\\.ts$/\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24345","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"alternatives to change TestBed configurations

`./projects/full-client` and `./projects/lite-client`) currently needs to be built via lowest common denominator. The \"lite\" client is targeting older browsers (like IE11, for example) while the \"full\" client targets evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, the root `.browserslistrc` file needs to include `ie11` in the list of supported browsers so the \"lite\" client will compile properly, but that forces the \"full\" client to compile for IE11 as well.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nEach project folder should be able to specify their own `.browserslistrc` file that overrides a root-level one.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe've moved shared functionality to a stand-alone library project, and the two front-ends are separate Angular projects. We'd love to be able to put all three of these under a single project folder and have `npm run build` just work.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24339","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Browserslist unique for each project\"

\"@angular/cdk\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:  \"^15.0.0\",\r\n- CDK/Material:  \"^15.0.0\",\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n-

outline color in RTL when form-field input is disabled/focused","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in v14\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nNotice how the outline of a disabled datepicker with `dir=\"rtl\"` isn't fully grayed out:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5672108/204502634-7d8bfc56-aaeb-4879-8a6d-e34a282f3569.png)\r\n\r\nThe issue also affects regular form-fields with disabled `<input matInput>` / `<mat-select>`.\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nIn LTR, the disabled border-color is set after the border-left property, so it works fine, but in RTL, they are set in opposite order (perhaps due to higher specificity of the CSS rule), causing the border-right property to override border-color.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5672108/204504953-e6b6d8db-b3b7-4346-8ab3-dd5fa47101da.png)\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\nConsider replacing `border-right: 1px solid;` with individual properties to avoid implicitly setting `border-right-color` as part of `border-right`. I.e., consider replacing:\r\n```scss\r\n[dir=rtl] .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-notched-outline__leading[dir=rtl] {\r\n        border-right: 1px solid;  <--\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith:\r\n```scss\r\n[dir=rtl] .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-notched-outline__leading[dir=rtl] {\r\n    border-left: none;\r\n    border-right-width: 1px;    <--\r\n    border-right-style: solid;  <-- \r\n}\r\n```\r\n(and similarly for the left side)\r\n\r\n## Temporary workaround\r\n\r\nGlobal CSS:\r\n```scss\r\n// Temporary workaround for bug https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26115.\r\n.mdc-text-field--disabled .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-text-field--disabled .mdc-notched-outline__trailing {\r\n  border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06) !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Angular Material v15 (mdc components)\r\n2. dir=\"rtl\"\r\n3. `<mat-form-field appearance=\"outline\">`\r\n4. disabled input/select/datepicker\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n  <mat-form-field appearance=\"outline\">\r\n    <input matInput [matDatepicker]=\"datepicker\" disabled [(ngModel)]=\"date\">\r\n    <mat-datepicker-toggle matSuffix [for]=\"datepicker\"></mat-datepicker-toggle>\r\n    <mat-datepicker #datepicker [disabled]=\"false\"></mat-datepicker>\r\n  </mat-form-field>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nGray outline.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nPartially gray and partially black outline.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: `15.0.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `15.0.0`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26115","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(form-field outline, v15 mdc, RTL): Wrong outline color in RTL when form-field input is disabled/focused\" (#26115)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-12-01T03:31:37.0702795Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1895}

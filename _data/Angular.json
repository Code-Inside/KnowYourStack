aliases","State":"open","Body":"When an `@if` expression has an alias, only the type of the alias is currently narrowed. So for example, suppose `value` is `string|undefined`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@if (value; as alias) {\r\n  {{ value.length }} <!-- error, value may be undefined -->\r\n  {{ alias.length }} <!-- no error, alias is narrowed -->\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is especially noticeable when the expression contains guards which are preconditions for the aliased expression:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@if (a && b; as alias) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `a` would not be narrowed within the body, even though the `@if` condition forces it to be truthy. This is a bug.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that aliased expressions were previously type-checked as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nvar alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // nothing other than alias is narrowed\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne option considered was to emit `const alias` instead of `var alias`. TypeScript _does_ trace `const` expressions and narrow their individual components when the overall expression is guarded:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // a, b are also narrowed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this narrowing has different semantics than if `a && b` appeared directly in the guard expression. For example, object properties aren't narrowed with this approach, so component properties (which are referenced as e.g. `this.a`) would not be narrowed.\r\n\r\nInstead, a different technique is used. The alias variable is declared with no type, and gets its type inferred by the guard expression:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nlet alias;\r\nif (alias = (a && b)) {\r\n  // a, b, and alias all narrowed correctly.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis form ensures all conditions within the guard expression get narrowed while also narrowing the alias variable type, and works for property narrowing as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #52855","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55159","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): fix type narrowing of `@if` with aliases\" (#55159)"},{"Id":"2218963363","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-01T19:58:37","Actor":"devknoll","Number":"55158","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add withDomEmulation() support","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The reason that I use this `deployUrl` is it provides a lot of benefit to deploy application to different places (servers) with different path of JS and CSS files. I'd had not faced this issue with version 10. In this version 16, I got many errors in the log. The error looks like this below.\r\n\r\n`Unable to locate stylesheet: /dist/apps/{appName}/browser/{appName}/styles.ab877c333925063d.css`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo disable this error, I tried to set this `inlineCriticalCss` with `false` value in `server.ts` file, but the problem is the page got flicker with blue links which caught user attention. I must force to remove this `inlineCriticalCss` and leave the log in the console.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`\r\n...\r\nserver.engine(\r\n    'html',\r\n    ngExpressEngine({\r\n      bootstrap: AppServerModule,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        { provide: 'someToken', useFactory: () => tokenData, deps: [] },\r\n      ],\r\n      inlineCriticalCss: false\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n...\r\n`\r\nThe log on this error kept increasing every day. I had done many research around this issue and still there is no solution so far. I am trying to create this issue here is not to duplicate what had been raised before but to support the idea to fix this issue in Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe information

This should either have been set to \"true\" by default for now (to hide them) or documented as a breaking change.  I just took a normal minor release and now my app which makes extensive use of button toggles has positioning issues all over the place due to the checkmark.

I thought there was no `tabindex` until I found this comment which obiously said you can acces it through `[tabIndex]` https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20883#issuecomment-744759846.\r\n\r\nNow the first question: is it expected to have no mentions of the `tabIndex` in the documentation? Because there is already the `id` and `value` inputs for example and I believe the `tabIndex` could be there too. Also apprently I'm not the only one on the internet struggling knowing it exists. I think it could be a good addition to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you think it makes totally sense üéâI'm super motivated to update the repository to see them. I already checked in the source code that all these components have a tabindex input:\r\n* button\r\n* checkbox\r\n* chips\r\n* datepicker\r\n* expansion-panel\r\n* radio\r\n* select\r\n* slide-toggle\r\n* tab\r\n* tree\r\nI also have the feeling that the documentation uses the comments from [angular/component](https://github.com/angular/component) and is generated in [angular/material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io). So I have the feeling I only need to update angular/component. As far as I understand there is already comments above the `tabIndex` input so it should be visible in the documentation. \r\n\r\nIf angular/component seems OK I was wondering maybe in angular/material.angular.io there is some filtering that ignores `tabIndex` but no mentions at all about `tabIndex` so I have the feeling that our problem doesn't lay there.\r\n\r\nLast point, in the API Report File for \"components-srcs\" I can see some attributes with `// (undocumented)` comment above. These attributes aren't visible in the documentation. But still, the `tabIndex` don't have this kind of comment above.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to fix this problem myself but it would be nice if someone could give me some hints on where to look. It would save me some time :)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttp://localhost:4200/components/chips/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Tabindex is missing in the documentation\" (#28793)"},{"Id":"2213590003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T16:01:06","Actor":"XavierDupessey","Number":"28792","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/drag-drop): DRAG AND DROP SELECTING TEXT WITH SHADOW DOM ENCAPSULATION ON FIREFOX","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with Drag and Drop examples from https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview when a parent component is encapsulated with Shadow DOM **on Firefox**: it selects text of other elements (cf video).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/1449888/2273a28d-637c-4a55-bb85-bfcfed87119c\r\n\r\nI tested it with the \"Drag&Drop connected sorting\" example from version 14 to 17.\r\nThe bug exists in all versions (I did not try older versions).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nXavier\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link (under v14): https://stackblitz.com/edit/gszzna?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

However  the child's event is not being catched in the parent component.  When we add the decorator the event is catched in the parent component as expected and handling function is executed. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, that his behaviour goes unnoticed, regardless any strict compiler options. It can be easy to forget adding the decorator, and then you just introduce a severe functional bug into your application. \r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-smqkao?file=src/app/child/child.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe parents handler function is not executed, but the application compiles and runs just as nothing would be wrong. You have no effective means to find such a bug. \r\n\r\nI got suggestions like to write linter rules or unittests, but i don't think its a right way to ensure syntactical correctnes of a program.

(e.g. : Ngrx's state & effects).\r\n\r\nThis initialization logic can be added:\r\n1. at bootstrap with `.forRoot()` pattern\r\n2. lazily by importing a module with the `.forChild()` or `.forFeature()` pattern. _(e.g.  `EffectsModule.forFeature(...)`)_\r\n\r\nWith standalone components and without considering the NgModule compatibility function `importProvidersFrom`, we now have 2 main options for triggering initialization logic:\r\n\r\n1. using `APP_INITIALIZER` at bootstrap,\r\n```ts\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n      useValue() {\r\n        console.log('init...');\r\n        inject(Store).registerEffects([...]);\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. using `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` in router providers.\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  path: '...',\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n      useValue() {\r\n        console.log('init...');\r\n        inject(Store).registerEffects([...]);\r\n      },\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  children: [\r\n    ...\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with the first approach (i.e. bootstrap) is the eager loading of all the logic (e.g. states / effects) and this doesn't scale as the main bundle will keep getting larger and larger.\r\nThe second option (`ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` with router providers) allows lazy loading but is it the highest common point after the bootstrap? Not really. In fact, a state will mostly be used by components under some shared route but quickly while the app grows, one might want to reuse the component under another route or anywhere else in the app and that’s when things get tricky. As we broke the locality principle, we have to think about checking out the route providers and move the state/effects to somewhere higher… which will end up to be the bootstrap… and thus the clutter in the main bundle.\r\nIn addition to this, we can mention the challenge of debugging the state/effects provided in the routing. Someone tries to use a component outside the route and they observe the following surprising behavior “if I navigate to the feature route first, then I move to the other route, the component works, but when I land directly on this route, the action doesn’t change the state” (because the effect wasn’t loaded).\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: providing state at bootstrap clutters the bundle and providing state at router level doesn’t scale either as one has to keep thinking about which state should be provided**\r\n\r\n### Concrete example:\r\nAn app with an UnreadEmailComponent and bunch of other components used in /emails . Email state/effects are provided at the route level.\r\nMonths/years later, someone wants to lazy load and dynamically inject UnreadEmailComponent in a dialog or something like that when the user clicks somewhere in the landing page.\r\nIf they visit /emails first, it’s going to work but before navigating to /emails the effects/state are not initialized. First, they end up with a bug, then they need to be quite familiar with Ngrx and injectors to understand what’s happening and that’s when they  decide to move the state/effects to bootstrap which is annoying because we end up eager loading state/effects while the components that need them are lazy loaded.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### `LAZY_APP_INITIALIZER` injection token\r\n\r\n- if provided at bootstrap, it would work like APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n- if provided with the routing or dynamic injection, it should be called once (we shouldn’t run a function if the same reference is provided again somewhere else) when the first depending environment is created,\r\n- if provided at node (i.e. component/directive/pipe) level, it should be called once if not already triggered during bootstrap, or env creation, or another component.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what would be the side effects of making this the default behavior of `APP_INITIALIZER`. It’s a breaking change, but what kind of apps/libs have lazy imported APP_INITIALIZER providers that are not executed and that would break the app if executed? Is that a plausible scenario?\r\n\r\nThis would allow something like this:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provideEffects(effects) {\r\n  return {\r\n    provide: LAZY_APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n    multi: true,\r\n    useValue() {\r\n      inject(Store).registerEffects(effects);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst emailFeatureProviders = [provideEffects([...]), provideState(...), EmailFacade];\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: ...,\r\n  providers: [emailFeatureProviders]\r\n})\r\nexport class UnreadEmail {} \r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: ...,\r\n  providers: [emailFeatureProviders],\r\n})\r\nexport class EmailInfo {} \r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n@alxhub's side-effect trick:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provideStoreWithFeature(feature: ...): Provider[] {\r\n  return [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: Store,\r\n      useFactory: () => {\r\n        const rootStore = inject(RootStore);\r\n        for (const feature of inject(STORE_FEATURE, [])) {\r\n          rootStore.registerFeature(feature);\r\n        }\r\n        return rootStore;\r\n      },\r\n    }, {\r\n      provide: STORE_FEATURE,\r\n      useValue: feature,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n    },\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45970","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow lazy initialization logic with Standalone Components\" (#45970)"},{"Id":"1234062136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-12T14:21:58","Actor":"vugar005","Number":"45969","RawContent":null,"Title":"Define Angular Custom element without ngModules","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nelements\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello team,\r\nSo without standalone on to define a custom element as you know we use below syntax:\r\n```\r\nexport class AppModule implements DoBootstrap {\r\n  constructor(private injector: Injector) {}\r\n\r\n  public ngDoBootstrap(): void {\r\n    const ce = createCustomElement(AppComponent, { injector: this.injector });\r\n    customElements.define('likes-app-element', ce);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut how should we do this without `NgModules`?\r\nI tried to add above snippet to `AppComponent` but seems it does not create custom element and we receive error:\r\n`the selector \"likes-app-root\" did not match any elements.`\r\nI think this is because we already bootstrap AppComponent in main.ts file.

For example:\r\n\r\n- they force us to have nullable values just in case one calls `reset()`, which unfortunately sets the value to null, unless we explicitly use the option `initialValueIsDefault`. Even though, in my experience, calling `reset()` is extremely rare.\r\n- they force us to have undefined-able values in form groups just in case one would disable a control, thus making its value absent of the form group's value. Disabling fields is more common in my experience than calling `reset()`, but still quite rare.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand:\r\n- they don't care at all if the CVA used to set the control's value sets it to null (like in the example in the stackblitz). Using number inputs, or select boxes with a default null option, for example, is extremely common in my experience. And in that case, the non-nullability of the FormControl is a lie.\r\n\r\nI would expect more consistency:\r\n- either forms are paranoid, and don't ever let the typing lie, but in that case, a form control initialized with the `initialValueIsDefault` option and a non null initial value should check that its value is never set to null and throw if it's the case (like in the provided example)\r\n- or forms should give the control of the type to the developer: if they know that they never call reset(), and that they never disable a control, and that the CVA never sets the value to null, then let them choose the type they want, and too bad for them if they screwed up (i.e. basically what happens every type you do `http.get<Something>()`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

These annotations are passed through into the output by esbuild since many JavaScript tools understand them. However, there was an edge case where printing this comment before a function call caused esbuild to fail to parenthesize a function literal because it thought it was no longer at the start of the expression. This problem has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })()\n\n    // Old output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ function() {\n    }();\n\n    // New output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Preserve `...` before JSX child expressions ([#&#8203;2245](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2245))\n\n    TypeScript 4.5 changed how JSX child expressions that start with `...` are emitted. Previously the `...` was omitted but starting with TypeScript 4.5, the `...` is now preserved instead. This release updates esbuild to match TypeScript's new output in this case:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    console.log(<a>{...b}</a>)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, b));\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, ...b));\n    ```\n\n    Note that this behavior is TypeScript-specific. Babel doesn't support the `...` token at all (it gives the error \"Spread children are not supported in React\").\n\n-   Slightly adjust esbuild's handling of the `browser` field in `package.json` ([#&#8203;2239](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2239))\n\n    This release changes esbuild's interpretation of `browser` path remapping to fix a regression that was introduced in esbuild version 0.14.21. Browserify has a bug where it incorrectly matches package paths to relative paths in the `browser` field, and esbuild replicates this bug for compatibility with Browserify. I have a set of tests that I use to verify that esbuild's replication of this Browserify is accurate here: https://github.com/evanw/package-json-browser-tests. However, I was missing a test case and esbuild's behavior diverges from Browserify in this case. This release now handles this edge case as well:\n\n    -   `entry.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('pkg/sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/package.json`:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"browser\": {\n            \"./sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\",\n            \"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/sub/foo.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/sub/index.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        console.log('works')\n        ```\n\n    The import path `sub` in `require('sub')` was previously matching the remapping `\"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` but with this release it should now no longer match that remapping. Now `require('sub')` will only match the remapping `\"./sub/sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` (without the trailing `.js`). Browserify apparently only matches without the `.js` suffix here.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.2`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0262-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0261v0262-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   specify types in exports ([#&#8203;214](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/214)) ([985e7b4](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/985e7b4d8a6fd5911d2ad2e6524999e9198a6b9f))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr</summary>\n\n### [`v14.0.0-rc.0`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-rc0-httpsgithubcomng-packagrng-packagrcomparev1400-next10v1400-rc0-2022-05-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/v14.0.0-next.10...v14.0.0-rc.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>yargs/yargs</summary>\n\n### [`v17.5.0`](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1750-httpsgithubcomyargsyargscomparev1741v1750-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.1...v17.5.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add browser.d.ts and check for existence of Error.captureStackTrace() ([#&#8203;2144](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2144)) ([6192990](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/6192990509cf793c4b10b88884d626893dee89df))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **completion:** support for default flags ([db35423](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/db354232705623bbcd8fad362f6a4d6d59650be5))\n-   import yargs/yargs in esm projects ([#&#8203;2151](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2151)) ([95aed1c](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/95aed1c175ec82e585003883bda1b6b75d5493ce))\n\n##### [17.4.1](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.0...v17.4.1) (2022-04-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   coerce pollutes argv ([#&#8203;2161](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2161)) ([2d1136d](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/2d1136d303ea805685a973ded62f52efd49b78b9))\n-   **completion:** don't show positional args choices with option choices ([#&#8203;2148](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2148)) ([b58b5bc](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/b58b5bc2cda7fc15acf559ae4a6a0eda0be06044))\n-   hide hidden options from completion ([#&#8203;2143](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2143)) ([e086dfa](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/e086dfad7ff11956b1e8779c00cf2351a4cc3b03)), closes [#&#8203;2142](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2142)\n-   show message when showHelpOnFail is chained globally ([#&#8203;2154](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2154)) ([ad9fcac](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/ad9fcacb001a7eb842924408f3a06865a7c7a3b6))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

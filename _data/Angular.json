It would be very handy to get an error already during static code analysis at compile time.\n\nThe simplest case that should be detected is this:\n\n```ts\n// a.service.ts\n@Injectable()\nexport class A {\n  private readonly b = inject(B);\n}\n\n// b.service.ts\n@Injectable()\nexport class B {\n  private readonly a = inject(A);\n}\n```\n\nBut of course, it's not as easy to track down if you have more services in between.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIf there is a circular dependency injection, there should be a compile-time error\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Currently, you get a run-time error. So if you're lucky and have good test coverage, tests will also detect this issue.\n- Th eslint rule `import/no-cycle` implies that there are no dependency injection circles - but there are cases e.g. when you use `forwardRef()` where you might have import cycles - but still don't want circular dependency injection.\n- This request is similar to #48976 but (slightly) different: The error should not just detect problems for standalone components, but everywhere when dependency injection is used.\n- I suggested this as eslint rule first (https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint/issues/2082) and @JamesHenry said that this should rather be a framework feature.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58281","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: detect circular dependency injection and throw compile error\" (#58281)"},{"Id":"2603592746","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T20:30:09","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"58291","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: use application builder for adev karma tests","State":"open","Body":"The tests are now no longer bundled using webpack but instead are using the new application builder (esbuild etc.).\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'm working on a Hacker News PWA using the latest version of Angular CLI. I'm trying to make a simple GET request using HttpClient, but `ng serve` is complaining about type errors and refusing to serve my app.\n\nHere is my demo app at the line that is causing issues https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15 (at commit [57486f3](https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/commit/57486f34baff84025d720e8bb5e1f2b79246cb63)\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nThe documentation here describes `HttpClient.get` as having an optional type argument, and if the argument is omitted the response should be typed as `any`\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data\n>Note the generic type argument which specifies that the data returned by the server will be of type Config. This argument is optional, and if you omit it then the returned data will have type any.\n\nWhat I'm actually seeing in my editor and from Angular CLI is that this response is typed as `Object`\n> `(property) StoriesListComponent.storyIds$: Observable<Object>`\n\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nHere is my demo app at the line that is causing issues https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI think in this case the documentation is correct and the HttpClient implementation has a bug. I think that if there is no explicit type argument provided to `HttpClient.get` then `any` or `unknown` are both better defaults than `Object`. In this particular case the publick Hackernews API returns a JSON response with an array of strings `string[]`, so the behavior that I'm seeing with type `Object` is not accurate in this case.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc85a6aa-228d-4fd2-8e0e-3e5c1816694c)\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\nI'm of course open to the possibility that I've made a mistake in my own code, but in this case I'm having a hard time finding where that might be. In this case I think the example I've provided at https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15 is fairly straightforward and does not match my expectations based on the documentation.\n\nI also understand the motivations for discouraging the use of `any`, but in this case I think it is appropriate. In this case I need to combine multiple HTTP requests before I get a response that I can meaningfully type, and I'd like to be able to do this without needing to explicitly type every intermediary request, especially during development. I could also understand the use of `unknown` here, but I think that `Object` is incorrect.\n\nAs a stretch goal, I think it would be nice if Angular CLI and `ng serve` provided a command line option to skip type checking at development time. I'm a huge advocate for Typescript and strong typing, largely thanks to Angular's influence on me :P, but during development and especially during prototyping, I think it would be nice to be able to treat type errors as warnings so that I can continue to build out my UI without being hindered by type errors for types that I might not yet have fully fleshed out.\n\nThanks, Angular!

Right now I cannot use `ng serve`and use `ng build --watch` plus `http-server`.\n\nI know that esbuild doesn't support dynamic imports when you use non-static strings, but these are straightforward imports.\n\nI also read, and tried to understand the texts linked here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/75690800/esbuild-cjs-not-working-when-importing-the-default-of-an-hybrid-module\n\n\n### Expected behavior\nI would want `serve`and `build`to have the same behaviour for the same code or if that's not possible, to find one set of syntax and config that works in both.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSmall reproduction is here:\nhttps://github.com/stnor/lazy-deps (ng new + some added deps + changes to app.component.ts with outputs information using console.log)\n\n1. run `start`\n\nconsole output:\n```\nawait import type= object\napp.component.ts:23 await import jQueryAwait= {fn: {…}, expando: 'jQuery37106325101847870058', isReady: false, extend: ƒ, error: ƒ, …}\napp.component.ts:26 await import jQueryAwait.module= undefined\napp.component.ts:21 ERROR Error: Dynamic require of \"jquery\" is not supported\n    at main.js:5:9\n    at _AppComponent.<anonymous> (app.component.ts:29:22)\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\n    at fulfilled (main.js:11:24)\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone.js:369:28)\n    at Object.onInvoke (core.mjs:7045:25)\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone.js:368:34)\n    at ZoneImpl.run (zone.js:111:43)\n    at zone.js:2538:40\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:402:33)\n```\n\n2. run `watch` + `http-server` \n\nconsole output:\n```\napp.component.ts:22 await import type= object\napp.component.ts:23 await import jQueryAwait= Module {Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag): 'Module'}\napp.component.ts:26 await import jQueryAwait.module= undefined\napp.component.ts:30 using require function ƒ (selector, context) {\n        return new jQuery.fn.init(selector, context);\n      }\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\nDynamic require of \"xxx\" is not supported\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.9\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.8\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.9\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.9\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.9\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.9\n@angular/cli                    18.2.9\n@schematics/angular             18.2.9\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n    \n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28679","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"differences in behavior when using ng:serve, ng:build for cjs default lazy imports\" (#28679)"},{"Id":"2595280206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T11:21:29","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28659","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): create component stylesheet bundler at start of build","State":"closed","Body":"**refactor(@angular/build): move component stylesheet bundler out of compiler plugin**\r\n\r\nThe component stylesheet bundler is now created during the setup of the Angular\r\ncompiler plugin options.

Initially, I assumed this was a personal issue, but several team members have reported the same experience.\n\nUpon reviewing the CSS code, I found that the backdrop color is [set to a single value](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/5ad133d07341fa8647e81277e7f1b9f54b15059a/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L9), regardless of the theme. Currently, it's a faded black, which works fine for light themes but leads to poor contrast in dark themes. This reduces the legibility of the dialog content, making it harder to distinguish between the page background and the overlay.\n\nIn previous Material 2 theling API, dark themes used a faded white backdrop, which provided better contrast and enhanced readability.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/specs and see that dialog example use a white backdrop on dark mode\n2. Go to https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview, select a dark theme and open dialog in any example\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0043da65-f28c-4cce-bb3a-dcb6bf0cf517)\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d542b0d-fcc4-423d-85a9-02f6cd61f411)\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Chrome (latest)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu 24.10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29903","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): low contrast for dialog backdrop in dark theme\" (#29903)"},{"Id":"2602336016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T12:01:04","Actor":"simonkovtyk","Number":"29902","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference","State":"open","Body":"Hi there ...\r\n\r\nRecently, I made some own implementations to support multiple paletts for m3 and I orientated my code at the token generation here.\r\n\r\nI found out, that Angular Material is not using the right tokens for some color rules as described in the [offical Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460).\r\n\r\nHere is an overview:\r\n| Token                    | Hue (Angular Material) | Hue (Material spec)                      |\r\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\r\n| on-primary-container     | Primary 10             | Primary 30                               |\r\n| on-primary-fixed-variant | Primary 30             | Secondary 30 (from primary palette)      |\r\n| on-secondary-container   | Secondary 10           | Secondary 30                             |\r\n| on-tertiary-container    | Tertiary 10            | Tertiary 30                              |","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29902","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(m3-tokens): wrong hue reference\" (#29902)"},{"Id":"2601644960","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T07:38:42","Actor":"Bogatejc","Number":"29901","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(google-maps): missing exports for new map marker clusterer types","State":"open","Body":"**Description**\nIt appears that the recent refactor of the Map Marker Clusterer component introduced the need to specify a Renderer and an Algorithm to customize the map marker clusterer.

Observe that these types are not available for import, resulting in an error or limitation in customization.\n\n**Fix**\nAdd the following line to `src/google-maps/public-api.ts`\n```JavaScript\nexport {\n  Renderer,\n  Algorithm,\n  AlgorithmInput,\n  AlgorithmOutput,\n  Cluster,\n  ClusterStats,\n} from './map-marker-clusterer/map-marker-clusterer-types';\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29901","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(google-maps): missing exports for new map marker clusterer types\" (#29901)"},{"Id":"2601565253","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T07:02:59","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29900","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(multiple): remove CommonModule imports","State":"open","Body":"Removes all our imports of `CommonModule` in tests since it wasn't being used for anything.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29900","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(multiple): remove CommonModule imports\" (#29900)"},{"Id":"2600226929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T09:29:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29899","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tabs): remove IE animation workaround","State":"open","Body":"Removes a workaround that's no longer necessary now that we don't support IE.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29899","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/tabs): remove IE animation workaround\" (#29899)"},{"Id":"2599961927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T04:21:23","Actor":"K0n4ta13","Number":"29898","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added","State":"open","Body":"I add the README file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29898","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): README.md added\" (#29898)"},{"Id":"2598834904","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T16:49:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29897","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): allow optgroup overrides through core-overrides","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that we were supporting overrides for `mat-option` through the `core-overrides` mixin, but not for `mat-optgroup`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29897","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): allow optgroup overrides through core-overrides\" (#29897)"},{"Id":"2598115816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T15:47:26","Actor":"Gopi7a","Number":"29896","RawContent":null,"Title":"standalone missing: stackBlitz example page","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOnce we click the stackBlitz link from the Angular Material page, showing error like  \"error NG2010: 'imports' is only valid on a component that is standalone.\"\nAll the sample code in the stackBlitz missing **standalone: true** in @Component decorator.\n\nChecked version 18+\n\nAngular Material team, need to fix it.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=.gitignore\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

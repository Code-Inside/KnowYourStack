(e.g. : Ngrx's state & effects).\r\n\r\nThis initialization logic can be added:\r\n1. at bootstrap with `.forRoot()` pattern\r\n2. lazily by importing a module with the `.forChild()` or `.forFeature()` pattern. _(e.g.  `EffectsModule.forFeature(...)`)_\r\n\r\nWith standalone components and without considering the NgModule compatibility function `importProvidersFrom`, we now have 2 main options for triggering initialization logic:\r\n\r\n1. using `APP_INITIALIZER` at bootstrap,\r\n```ts\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n      useValue() {\r\n        console.log('init...');\r\n        inject(Store).registerEffects([...]);\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. using `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` in router providers.\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  path: '...',\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n      useValue() {\r\n        console.log('init...');\r\n        inject(Store).registerEffects([...]);\r\n      },\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  children: [\r\n    ...\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with the first approach (i.e. bootstrap) is the eager loading of all the logic (e.g. states / effects) and this doesn't scale as the main bundle will keep getting larger and larger.\r\nThe second option (`ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` with router providers) allows lazy loading but is it the highest common point after the bootstrap? Not really. In fact, a state will mostly be used by components under some shared route but quickly while the app grows, one might want to reuse the component under another route or anywhere else in the app and that’s when things get tricky. As we broke the locality principle, we have to think about checking out the route providers and move the state/effects to somewhere higher… which will end up to be the bootstrap… and thus the clutter in the main bundle.\r\nIn addition to this, we can mention the challenge of debugging the state/effects provided in the routing. Someone tries to use a component outside the route and they observe the following surprising behavior “if I navigate to the feature route first, then I move to the other route, the component works, but when I land directly on this route, the action doesn’t change the state” (because the effect wasn’t loaded).\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: providing state at bootstrap clutters the bundle and providing state at router level doesn’t scale either as one has to keep thinking about which state should be provided**\r\n\r\n### Concrete example:\r\nAn app with an UnreadEmailComponent and bunch of other components used in /emails . Email state/effects are provided at the route level.\r\nMonths/years later, someone wants to lazy load and dynamically inject UnreadEmailComponent in a dialog or something like that when the user clicks somewhere in the landing page.\r\nIf they visit /emails first, it’s going to work but before navigating to /emails the effects/state are not initialized. First, they end up with a bug, then they need to be quite familiar with Ngrx and injectors to understand what’s happening and that’s when they  decide to move the state/effects to bootstrap which is annoying because we end up eager loading state/effects while the components that need them are lazy loaded.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### `LAZY_APP_INITIALIZER` injection token\r\n\r\n- if provided at bootstrap, it would work like APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n- if provided with the routing or dynamic injection, it should be called once (we shouldn’t run a function if the same reference is provided again somewhere else) when the first depending environment is created,\r\n- if provided at node (i.e. component/directive/pipe) level, it should be called once if not already triggered during bootstrap, or env creation, or another component.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what would be the side effects of making this the default behavior of `APP_INITIALIZER`. It’s a breaking change, but what kind of apps/libs have lazy imported APP_INITIALIZER providers that are not executed and that would break the app if executed? Is that a plausible scenario?\r\n\r\nThis would allow something like this:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provideEffects(effects) {\r\n  return {\r\n    provide: LAZY_APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n    multi: true,\r\n    useValue() {\r\n      inject(Store).registerEffects(effects);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst emailFeatureProviders = [provideEffects([...]), provideState(...), EmailFacade];\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: ...,\r\n  providers: [emailFeatureProviders]\r\n})\r\nexport class UnreadEmail {} \r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: ...,\r\n  providers: [emailFeatureProviders],\r\n})\r\nexport class EmailInfo {} \r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n@alxhub's side-effect trick:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provideStoreWithFeature(feature: ...): Provider[] {\r\n  return [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: Store,\r\n      useFactory: () => {\r\n        const rootStore = inject(RootStore);\r\n        for (const feature of inject(STORE_FEATURE, [])) {\r\n          rootStore.registerFeature(feature);\r\n        }\r\n        return rootStore;\r\n      },\r\n    }, {\r\n      provide: STORE_FEATURE,\r\n      useValue: feature,\r\n      multi: true,\r\n    },\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45970","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow lazy initialization logic with Standalone Components\" (#45970)"},{"Id":"1233312721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-12T16:25:29","Actor":"atscott","Number":"45965","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Prevent TSServer from removing templates from …","State":"closed","Body":"…project\r\n\r\nAs part of the `updateProjectIfDirty` process and inside `updateNonInferredProjectFiles`\r\nTS Server will remove the template files that we added as roots in\r\n`readResource`.\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/github.com/microsoft/TypeScript@c300fea3250abd7f75920d95a58d9e742ac730ee/-/blob/src/server/editorServices.ts?L2363\r\n\r\nThe external files are added to the list here so ensuring that the\r\ntemplates are included in the `getExternalFiles` will prevent this from\r\nhappening\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/github.com/microsoft/TypeScript@c300fea3250abd7f75920d95a58d9e742ac730ee/-/blob/src/server/editorServices.ts?L2395:18\r\n\r\nReviewer note: there are no tests here because we don't simulate the whole situation in the language service tests well enough.

For example:\r\n\r\n- they force us to have nullable values just in case one calls `reset()`, which unfortunately sets the value to null, unless we explicitly use the option `initialValueIsDefault`. Even though, in my experience, calling `reset()` is extremely rare.\r\n- they force us to have undefined-able values in form groups just in case one would disable a control, thus making its value absent of the form group's value. Disabling fields is more common in my experience than calling `reset()`, but still quite rare.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand:\r\n- they don't care at all if the CVA used to set the control's value sets it to null (like in the example in the stackblitz). Using number inputs, or select boxes with a default null option, for example, is extremely common in my experience. And in that case, the non-nullability of the FormControl is a lie.\r\n\r\nI would expect more consistency:\r\n- either forms are paranoid, and don't ever let the typing lie, but in that case, a form control initialized with the `initialValueIsDefault` option and a non null initial value should check that its value is never set to null and throw if it's the case (like in the provided example)\r\n- or forms should give the control of the type to the developer: if they know that they never call reset(), and that they never disable a control, and that the CVA never sets the value to null, then let them choose the type they want, and too bad for them if they screwed up (i.e. basically what happens every type you do `http.get<Something>()`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

The `srcset` attribute cannot be set statically\r\non the image directive because it would cause images to start\r\ndownloading before the \"loading\" attribute could be set to \"lazy\".\r\n\r\nChanging the name to `rawSrcset` allows the directive to control\r\nthe timing of image loading. It also makes it possible to support\r\ncustom loaders for `srcset` file names. Rather than having to repeat\r\nthe image origin for each image, the existing `rawSrc` value and\r\nimage loader can be composed to generate each full URL string. The\r\ndeveloper must only provide the necessary widths for the `srcset`.\r\n\r\nFor example, the developer might write:\r\n\r\n```markup\r\n<img rawSrc=\"hermes.jpg\" rawSrcset=\"100w, 200w\" ... />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a loader like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst loader = (config) => `path/${config.src}?w=${config.width}`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the img tag will ultimately be set up as something like:\r\n\r\n```markup\r\n<img src=\"path/hermes.jpg?w=100\" srcset=\"path/hermes.jpg?w=100 100w, path/hermes.jpg?w=200 200w\" .../>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

These annotations are passed through into the output by esbuild since many JavaScript tools understand them. However, there was an edge case where printing this comment before a function call caused esbuild to fail to parenthesize a function literal because it thought it was no longer at the start of the expression. This problem has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })()\n\n    // Old output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ function() {\n    }();\n\n    // New output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Preserve `...` before JSX child expressions ([#&#8203;2245](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2245))\n\n    TypeScript 4.5 changed how JSX child expressions that start with `...` are emitted. Previously the `...` was omitted but starting with TypeScript 4.5, the `...` is now preserved instead. This release updates esbuild to match TypeScript's new output in this case:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    console.log(<a>{...b}</a>)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, b));\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, ...b));\n    ```\n\n    Note that this behavior is TypeScript-specific. Babel doesn't support the `...` token at all (it gives the error \"Spread children are not supported in React\").\n\n-   Slightly adjust esbuild's handling of the `browser` field in `package.json` ([#&#8203;2239](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2239))\n\n    This release changes esbuild's interpretation of `browser` path remapping to fix a regression that was introduced in esbuild version 0.14.21. Browserify has a bug where it incorrectly matches package paths to relative paths in the `browser` field, and esbuild replicates this bug for compatibility with Browserify. I have a set of tests that I use to verify that esbuild's replication of this Browserify is accurate here: https://github.com/evanw/package-json-browser-tests. However, I was missing a test case and esbuild's behavior diverges from Browserify in this case. This release now handles this edge case as well:\n\n    -   `entry.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('pkg/sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/package.json`:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"browser\": {\n            \"./sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\",\n            \"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/sub/foo.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/sub/index.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        console.log('works')\n        ```\n\n    The import path `sub` in `require('sub')` was previously matching the remapping `\"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` but with this release it should now no longer match that remapping. Now `require('sub')` will only match the remapping `\"./sub/sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` (without the trailing `.js`). Browserify apparently only matches without the `.js` suffix here.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.2`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0262-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0261v0262-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   specify types in exports ([#&#8203;214](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/214)) ([985e7b4](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/985e7b4d8a6fd5911d2ad2e6524999e9198a6b9f))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr</summary>\n\n### [`v14.0.0-rc.0`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-rc0-httpsgithubcomng-packagrng-packagrcomparev1400-next10v1400-rc0-2022-05-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/v14.0.0-next.10...v14.0.0-rc.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>yargs/yargs</summary>\n\n### [`v17.5.0`](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1750-httpsgithubcomyargsyargscomparev1741v1750-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.1...v17.5.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add browser.d.ts and check for existence of Error.captureStackTrace() ([#&#8203;2144](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2144)) ([6192990](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/6192990509cf793c4b10b88884d626893dee89df))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **completion:** support for default flags ([db35423](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/db354232705623bbcd8fad362f6a4d6d59650be5))\n-   import yargs/yargs in esm projects ([#&#8203;2151](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2151)) ([95aed1c](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/95aed1c175ec82e585003883bda1b6b75d5493ce))\n\n##### [17.4.1](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.0...v17.4.1) (2022-04-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   coerce pollutes argv ([#&#8203;2161](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2161)) ([2d1136d](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/2d1136d303ea805685a973ded62f52efd49b78b9))\n-   **completion:** don't show positional args choices with option choices ([#&#8203;2148](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2148)) ([b58b5bc](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/b58b5bc2cda7fc15acf559ae4a6a0eda0be06044))\n-   hide hidden options from completion ([#&#8203;2143](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2143)) ([e086dfa](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/e086dfad7ff11956b1e8779c00cf2351a4cc3b03)), closes [#&#8203;2142](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2142)\n-   show message when showHelpOnFail is chained globally ([#&#8203;2154](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2154)) ([ad9fcac](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/ad9fcacb001a7eb842924408f3a06865a7c7a3b6))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

versions as mentioned but not properly solved here #4782 or here #18043\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Description & Minimal Reproduction\r\n1) `ng new test-app`\r\n2) Place a picture in `src/assets`\r\n\r\n**_We have to look at 2 different build environments:_**\r\n\r\n#### 1) Default dev env with `ng serve`\r\nThe default base-href is `<base href=\"/\"></base>`, which means all URIs don't have a prefix and have the default root.\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Status |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n|`<img src=\"/assets/img.png\" />` | works, but ignores the base-href |\r\n|`<img src=\"assets/img.png\" />` | works, is relative path from the root |\r\n|`background-imge: url('/assets/img.png')` | works, but ignores the base-href |\r\n|`background-imge: url('assets/img.png')` | works not |\r\n|`background-imge: url('~src/assets/img.png')` | works, why?? |\r\n\r\n####  2) Serving a production build using a webserver like nginx or apache\r\nNow we set the base-href to `<base href=\"/app/\"></base>` in index.html and set in **angular.json** `\"baseHref\": \"/app/\",` in `architect/configurations/production` and run `ng build`.\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Status |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| `<img src=\"/assets/img.png\" />`      | works not, because we have /app/ prefix after root       |\r\n| `<img src=\"assets/img.png\" />`   | works, path is updated to /app/assets/img.png by compiler        |\r\n| `<img src=\"./assets/img.png\" />`   | same as above        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('/assets/img.png')`   |  works not, because we have /app/ prefix after root        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('./assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('~src/assets/img.png')`   | ~~works not~~   **update: works**     |\r\n| `background-imge: url('~assets/img.png')`   | works not, build fails        |\r\n| `background-imge: url('/app/assets/img.png')`   | works, but uses root routing and breaks dev env  |\r\n\r\n**TLDR:**\r\nThere is no way to access asset files in SCSS with a changed base-href, without hardcoding the base-href in SCSS like `/app/assets/img.png` but breaking the local dev env.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./src/app/elements/phone-frame/phone-frame.component.scss?ngResource - Error: Module Error (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js):\r\n/Users/me/repositories/app-frontend/src/app/elements/phone-frame/phone-frame.component.scss:16:28: Can't resolve

relevant?**\r\nThe truth is I don't know much about updating node projects. I think this update tool has worked for me in the past but most of the time I just \"rebase\" my code onto a new project. I'm used to spring boot where to get everything updated I have to copy/paste one or two versions belonging to \"bom\" bill of material dependencies that set the version for everything else transitively. When I run `ng update` or `npm audit fix --force` what is it trying to do?

It will convert it to 01/02/0022\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (Windows):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24901","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"help(MatDatePicker): How do I disable automatic parsing/formatting for datepicker?\" (#24901)"},{"Id":"1231368072","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-10T15:58:35","Actor":"tiberiuzuld","Number":"24900","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(matDialog): afterOpened returns observable<void>","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nHello,\r\nThe documentation wrongly states that the afterOpened returns a `Subject<MatDialogRef<any>>` but in reality returns `Observable<void>`\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api#MatDialog\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * Reference to a dialog opened via the MatDialog service.\r\n */\r\nexport declare class MatDialogRef<T, R = any> {\r\n    ....\r\n    /**\r\n     * Close the dialog.\r\n     * @param dialogResult Optional result to return to the dialog opener.\r\n     */\r\n    close(dialogResult?: R): void;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Gets an observable that is notified when the dialog is finished opening.\r\n     */\r\n    afterOpened(): Observable<void>;\r\n```\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api#MatDialog","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24900","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(matDialog): afterOpened returns observable<void>\" (#24900)"},{"Id":"1230255701","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T21:11:09","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"24899","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): The selection is repeated twice (+) in screen readers ","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n(I have honestly no idea)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe selection of a basic mat-select gets read multiple time by screen readers, for example this is how it is presented by the chrome accessibility tree (note the two \"Pizza\"s there):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot at 2022-05-09 21-52-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61631103/167498408-90f07771-db07-44f1-b72a-866940d316a6.png)\r\n\r\nIn voiceOver the value is actually read once as the select value and twice as the label, so it actually gets read three times as you can see here:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61631103/167498553-c13866bb-ae13-4fa4-96dc-2b52e23c99b9.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the issue is caused by assigning to the `labelledby` both the label and the first selected value, as you can see here:\r\n![Screenshot at 2022-05-09 21-55-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61631103/167498641-7d2070c0-2fff-4697-81d1-c26afb4b1816.png)\r\n\r\n(note from the video that this does not happen when using native selects)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nAny basic mat-select seems to present this, for example the ones presented in the material docs: https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect it to work precisely as the native select elements as that should in theory be the cleanest behavior, if not at the least I would expect the selections not to be read multiple times\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nthe selection gets read multiple times, 2 or 3 times depending on the screen reader\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.3.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.3.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu and macOS\r\n\r\n### Extra\r\n - I tried looking for an issue describing the same bug, but I could not find any, sorry if there is one and I missed it\r\n - I am pretty sure this is not how it should work, sorry if I'm wrong","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24899","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): The selection is repeated twice (+) in screen readers \" (#24899)"},{"Id":"1229489372","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T10:52:48","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24898","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps): expose event manager","State":"closed","Body":"Exposes the `MapEventManager` that we use to bind events in the Google Maps package so that users implementing their own components can consume it as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24898","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps): expose event manager\" (#24898)"},{"Id":"1228831109","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-08T11:05:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24897","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(google-maps): error when minified through closure","State":"closed","Body":"In #24865 the access of the global `MarkerClusterer` class changed to go through the `window`.

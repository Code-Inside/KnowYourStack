This requires additional work for developers and the contextual knowledge to understand that this not only a best practice, but that page title _needs_ to be managed in order to make your application more accessible. \r\n\r\nEventually I'd like to see this option enforced as mandatory or throw a warning if not defined, to ensure Angular apps are more accessible by default. This known property could also be more easily caught with a lint rule.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\nW3 defines that [page title must be unique](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled). Angular is a single-page app and, as a result, a majority of transitions, such as moving to a new page, do not involve a page reload. This means that out of the box, each page is read with an identical page title, and provides no value for understanding the page's content or purpose for users using a11y services.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed feature\r\nDefine a know `title` property in the router's route definitions, which is then subscribed to automatically and uses the TitleService under the hood to manage page title on routing automatically.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  { path: 'chicken', component: ChickenComponent, title: 'Chicken - Farm Demo App' },\r\n  { path: 'goat', component: GoatComponent, title: 'Goat - Farm Demo App' },\r\n  { path: 'frog', component: FrogComponent, title: 'Frog - Farm Demo App' },\r\n  { path: '',   redirectTo: '/goat', pathMatch: 'full' }, // redirects ok without a title\r\n  { path: '**', component: HomeComponent }, // throws warning with no title prop defined\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nTitleService works, but again, it puts the burden on the developer to know about this single page app accessibility pitfall and how to implement unique page titles (and manage subscribing to the router ActivatedRoute or manage title in each route's component).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41626","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Define unique page titles in the Angular router (a11y)\" (#41626)"},{"Id":"858081823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T16:53:14","Actor":"kapunahelewong","Number":"41625","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add redirect and update updating-to-v11 to v12","State":"open","Body":"This PR changes the `updating-to-version-11.md ` to `updating-to-version-12.md`, adds v12 info, and adds a redirect for the new file.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n@aikidave , should we archive v11 instead of deleting it? \r\nWe still need some links (see NEED LINK comments).\r\nNeed SME guidance on the deprecations sections and the last Ivy section.\r\nI'd appreciate review of my descriptions for updates to make sure they're conveying changes accurately and with appropriate context.

The only difference between these two functions is that the `loadLContext` supports throwing an error in case `LContext` can not be found.

However, JIT mode requires that inline styles only be string literals (compile-time partial evaluation is not supported in JIT mode).

You will find that the scrollport will not request/display the first page of items from that new datasource **until the user scrolls the visible area**. \r\n\r\n**Motivation/Use Case**\r\nIn the real-world our virtual data can require some sort of user driven filtering, like a search screen. Which will require a complete replacement of all the underlying/cached data in the scroller with fresh results. This is ideally achieved by replacing the datasource when the user triggers the search.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nScroller should reset itself automatically when given a new datasource and request the first page of rows in exactly the same way it does when it was assigned the first datasource.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nCollectionViewer does not fire an event to the subscription in connect() until it has a range that differs.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fs9xei-rgkahy?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-data-source-example.ts\r\n\r\nRun the sample, initial list items will appear. Click on the \"Switch datasource button\", and you will see the items in the list stuck with saying \"loading...\" indefinitely. You have to scroll before the datasource actually gets asked for data to be able to be displayed.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nAngular: 11\r\nCDK/Material: 11\r\nBrowser(s): n/a\r\nOperating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): n/a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk) Replacing datasource does not refresh/display items in cdk-virtual-scrollport\" (#22464)"},{"Id":"855747257","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-12T17:13:27","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"22459","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: update `$schema` and `id` keyword","State":"closed","Body":"In Angular CLI version 12, JSON Schema `draft-04` will no longer be supported.

Then we had not compilation time issues. We maked update to version 12.\r\nAfter our update I got JIT compilation unavailable.\r\nI debugged the problem and I saw that the problem is in this two libraries because their compilationMode is set to 'partial'.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ng-select/ng-select/blob/master/src/ng-option-highlight/tsconfig.lib.json\r\nhttps://github.com/ng-select/ng-select/blob/master/src/ng-select/tsconfig.lib.json\r\n\r\nSo i tried using angular linker for that `@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel` as mentioned in the documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#consuming-partial-ivy-code-outside-the-angular-cli\r\n\r\nBut it is not working and I got error when i try that.\r\nI am not able to reproduce the issue on other custom created angular 12 project which directly installs these two dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe company library name is xcomponent-angular.

I tried removing the file and that didn't change anything.\r\n\r\nThe reported error message touches on `rxjs` and `angular-devkit` and doesn't give me enough information to debug or fix this myself.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nclone https://github.com/StephenFluin/baby-log/tree/stephen/v15-2\r\nyarn\r\n`ng serve`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nbaby-log$ ng serve\r\n\r\n/home/stephen/workspace/stephenfluin/baby-log/node_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/node_modules/rxjs/internal/util/hostReportError.js:4\r\n    setTimeout(function () { throw err; }, 0);\r\n                             ^\r\nError [BrowserslistError]: Unknown browser query `supports es6-module`.

[#&#8203;42546](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/42546)\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **zone.js:** in TaskTrackingZoneSpec track a periodic task until it is cancelled\n\nThe breaking change is scoped only to the plugin\n`zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\nchecked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner ._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\nits behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\npreviously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\ncallback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\nthe task is explicitly cancelled, e.g with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\n#### [0.11.5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.4...zone.js-0.11.5) (2022-03-03)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** async-test should only call done once ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([dea7234](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dea7234a76f652c8e9d9b79719e2b170a5a50777))\n-   **zone.js:** defineProperties should also set symbol props ([#&#8203;45098](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45098)) ([b437d12](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b437d1238d9006baa0cf749adbd7cc3270de3040)), closes [#&#8203;44095](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44095)\n-   **zone.js:** fix several test cases which trigger `done()` multiple times ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([d5565cc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d5565ccdb4573a47eb329b09c6852c1ae39672a6))\n-   **zone.js:** only one listener should also re-throw an error correctly ([#&#8203;41868](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41868)) ([299f92c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/299f92c3b62a43c94cff4a204f9e41c46a159efc)), closes [#&#8203;41867](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41867) [/github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562#issuecomment-822696973](https://togithub.com//github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562/issues/issuecomment-822696973)\n-   **zone.js:** patch global instead of Mocha object ([#&#8203;45047](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45047)) ([8efbdb5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8efbdb57c11a6c632f69d7e142a632b6a853fa46)), closes [#&#8203;42834](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/42834)\n-   **zone.js:** should continue to executue listeners when throw error ([#&#8203;41562](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41562)) ([008eaf3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/008eaf3b7df90b2cdd9c83e229d23d4014d6dbc9)), closes [#&#8203;41522](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41522)\n-   **zone.js:** update several flaky cases ([#&#8203;41526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41526)) ([25a83eb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/25a83eb264aa19fc4616cea45e04d790b9bcd777)), closes [#&#8203;41434](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41434)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **zone.js:** add Promise.any() implementation ([#&#8203;45064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45064)) ([4d494d2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4d494d24ccb69b40a477b0bccd97baf6af66accf)), closes [#&#8203;44393](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44393)\n-   **zone.js:** update electron patch to support electron/remote 14 ([#&#8203;45073](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45073)) ([d65706a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d65706a3b225ccb88d719478c19a379aef1b6047)), closes [#&#8203;43346](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/43346)\n\n#### [0.11.4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.3...zone.js-0.11.4) (2021-02-10)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** fesm2015 bundle should also be strict module.

This behavior used to hide real errors,\nso the logic is now updated to trigger original errors (if any). One exception\nwhere the patch remains in place is `document.registerElement`\n(to allow smooth transition for code/polyfills that rely on old behavior in legacy browsers).\nIf your code relies on the old behavior (where errors were not thrown before),\nyou may need to update the logic to handle the errors that are no longer masked by ZoneJS patch.\n\n#### [0.11.1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.0...zone.js-0.11.1) (2020-08-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** zone.js package.json should not include files/directories field ([#&#8203;38528](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38528)) ([6b662d1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6b662d1)), closes [#&#8203;38526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38526) [#&#8203;38516](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38516) [#&#8203;38513](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38513)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Render \"full\" appearance by default. \"minimal\" apperance renders only a checkmark.\r\n\r\nSummary of API and behavior changes:\r\n - Add an `@Input appearance` to pseudo-checkbox with options for \"full\" and \"minimal\".\r\n - mat-option renders \"minimal\" appearance for single-select, which looks like a checkmark.\r\n - Select and autocomplete components display checkmark on selected option.\r\n\r\nWhat's not changing:\r\n - does not affect multiple selection\r\n - mat-option renders \"full\" apperance by default, which is same as existing behavior\r\n\r\nFixes: #25961\r\n\r\n<img width=\"330\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437429-ca42bcf5-76e2-4cf2-8d1f-5cd3731eede9.png\">\r\n<img width=\"295\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437451-06f7a2ca-2890-4e27-b69f-6c0316fcde98.png\">\r\n<img width=\"447\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437482-b970a31a-48b3-405c-a802-cf89ceb0b166.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25962","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): add checkmark for single-select\" (#25962)"},{"Id":"1446014982","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T21:21:52","Actor":"zarend","Number":"25961","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/list, material/autocomplete): selected state is visually communicated only with color (WCAG 1.4.1)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nselect visually communicate selected state with color alone.

Appreciate any help/suggestions\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** To compile on the server is a requirement by the client, we don't have the people/time/resources to build something to deploy via CI/CD and/or docker, and honestly, is crazy we can't do a simply ng build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to reproduce this problem in another machine\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCreate a build\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild fails with import errors related to scss files/angular material/other files\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.1.1\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows server 2019\r\n\r\n**ng version info:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.1\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.41\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Angular 14): Error on build loading (SassError + Module Not found)\" (#25959)"},{"Id":"1445519790","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T14:03:31","Actor":"michahell","Number":"25958","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nI can't find specific documentation around Test harness API's for specific components...\r\n\r\non the main test harness documentation page there is an example for a select component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst select = await loader.getHarness(MatSelectHarness);\r\n    await select.open();\r\n    const bugOption = await select.getOption({text: 'Bug'});\r\n    await bugOption.click();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not work similarly for MatAutocompleteHarness:\r\nThere is a `.selectOption()` method which does not accept `{text: string}` but instead only `{selector: string, ancestor: string}` but nowhere this is explained.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/using-component-harnesses","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#25958)"},{"Id":"1445236695","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T10:01:16","Actor":"shernesbabu","Number":"25957","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdk/scrolling - scrolling is not working smoothly  for some input for custom strategy implemented by extending VirtualScrollStrategy","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe have to implement virtual scrolling for list of items where item can be of either 100px hight or 50px height.\r\nThe hight of each item is known before rendering, We implemented custom strategy by extending VirtualScrollStrategy. \r\nBut the scrolling is not smooth and it is flickering for some combination of elements.\r\nWe have tried the approach used this link - https://stackblitz.com/edit/custom-virtual-scroll-stack-overflow-answer?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcustom-virtual-scroll-strategy-directive.ts\r\nIs it really possible to implement virtual scrolling for variable size items by extending VirtualScrollStrategy?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. open https://stackblitz.com/edit/custom-virtual-scroll-stack-overflow-answer?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcustom-virtual-scroll-strategy-directive.ts\r\n\r\n2.

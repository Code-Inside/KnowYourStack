For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class ComponentA {\r\n  value = 0;\r\n  doSomething() {\r\n     setTimeout(() => value = 1, 50);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('test setTimeout`, waitForAsync(() => {\r\n  compa.doSomething();\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n   expect(compa.value).toBe(1);\r\n  }, 100);\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test the `async` operation such as `setTimeout` inside `waitForAsync()`, we need to know the exact `delay` of the `async` operations. But it is hard to know the exact delay duration in the real user case. So in this PR, there is a new API `onWaitForAsyncFinished()` is added to provide a callback to the user, the `callback` will be invoked when all `async` operations are finished.\r\n\r\n ```\r\nexport class ComponentA {\r\n  value = 0;\r\n  doSomething() {\r\n     setTimeout(() => value = 1, 50);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('test setTimeout`, waitForAsync(() => {\r\n  compa.doSomething();\r\n  onWaitForAsyncFinished(() => { \r\n   expect(compa.value).toBe(1);\r\n  });\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso this PR provide another API `onWaitForAsyncThrowError()` to catch all errors thrown inside the async operations.\r\n```\r\nexport class ComponentA {\r\n  value = 0;\r\n  doSomething() {\r\n     setTimeout(() => throw new Error('test'), 50);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('test setTimeout`, waitForAsync(() => {\r\n  compa.doSomething();\r\n  onWaitForAsyncThrowError((err) => { \r\n   expect(err.message).toBe('test');\r\n  });\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45211","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP(core): Add callback to waitForAsync() test helper\" (#45211)"},{"Id":"1152808768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-27T04:43:44","Actor":"maddielynklein","Number":"45210","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(http): Throw error when headers are supplied in JSONP request","State":"open","Body":"JSONP does not support headers being set on requests.

The examples however ignore the promise result, treating navigation as a fire-and-forget.\r\n\r\nWhen using linters with [rules that catch these \"floating promises\"](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-floating-promises.md), all our router.navigate() calls in various component functions legitimately trigger lint warnings.\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/api/router/Router#navigate\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\nAn example below:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-comp',\r\n  templateUrl: './my.component.html'\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private router: Router,\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  onButtonClick() {\r\n     if (... some condition ...) {\r\n       // should this be awaited? \r\n       // what if navigate is inside ngOnInit(), which is not async?\r\n       this.router.navigate(['some-path']);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\nI would like an official statement from the Angular team that it's okay to ignore the result of `router.navigate()` in our components, and - if possible - the design rationale for why it's returning a Promise that can be ignored. Ideally, this should be included as a note in the documentation, for instance a comment in the Usage notes section would be useful.\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

In my case, an unfortunate client requirement is that each environment is in a folder of a CDN endpoint, e.g. `cdnendpoint.com/dev/[files]`.\r\n\r\nThis necessitates changing the baseHref for an application, which can be done at build time or as part of modifying the base tag in index.html. It looks like it can be done programmatically as well; however, my attempts to do that fail to load the built angular files themselves, e.g. main.js, because they are still hard-coded to load from the root of the endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn this case, I'm not certain there *is* a solution (but am happy to hear if I've been doing something wrong, and am submitting in case someone sees a solution where I do not). I suppose the built artifacts need to be referenced in some way from index.html and the base tag is the most reasonable way to do that.\r\n\r\nIt might be that a guide to build once, deploy many angular apps in the docs that covers things like externalizing config and things like this that might have to be done could be helpful.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe StackOverflow in

The issue is tons of code was adapted to the fact that Angular Material input was not setting name attribute, so they directly set it themselves. Now with this change Angular Material Input overrides that.\r\n\r\nFor example, see [Covalent Dynamic Forms Input](https://github.com/Teradata/covalent/blob/main/src/platform/dynamic-forms/dynamic-elements/dynamic-input/dynamic-input.component.html)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set name attribute on a mat-input field directly with `[attr.name]=\"name\"`\r\n2. Try to access element by name attribute, such as in tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIf name attribute is directly set, then Angular Material Input needs to set name attribute more carefully.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAngular Material Input overrides name attribute directly set by user of mat-input.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24463","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/input): name property setting overrides developer defined name property\" (#24463)"},{"Id":"1146887211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T13:04:48","Actor":"davidglezz","Number":"24461","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark","State":"open","Body":"It seems that it was accidentally added in the first version of the component. unneeded attribute `xml:space` is removed.\r\n\r\nInfo about `xml:space`: http://www.xmlplease.com/xml/xmlspace/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24461","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark\" (#24461)"},{"Id":"1146085479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T20:49:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24459","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a regression caused by #19505 where clicking directly on the `input` element will prevent the click from reaching custom `click` listeners outside the radio button.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements\" (#24459)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-02-28T03:30:03.2905288Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2368}

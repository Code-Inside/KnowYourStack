This uses `buildah` as a hermetic build environment to create something a little more reliable and consistent between Angular developers and Mozilla reviewers.\r\n\r\nI opted for `buildah` over Docker because the latter requires some extra approvals we don't want to deal with (see http://go/vm-exception). The actual `buildah` stuff was left as short and simple as possible, instead delegating most of the work to a separate build script. The hardest part was getting Node installed, as `nvm install` just wouldn't work for reasons I couldn't figure out. Instead, I manually downloaded it using the same version from `.nvmrc`.\r\n\r\nI didn't update the release docs as I suspect it would be somewhat reudundant to ask Angular devs to go through this process and it significantly hurts build times since remote builds aren't configured. If we find discrepancies between local builds and the `buildah` builds, then we might want to re-evaluate that decision.\r\n\r\nI also included this as a CI task, since we want to make sure this remains stable for Mozilla reviewers.\r\n\r\n@jkrems, before we merge this, can you pull the PR and make sure it works for you on Mac? I tried to keep it as simple as possible, but I think there's a reasonable risk of the Bash being non-portable to Mac, so I want to make sure that gets sorted.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63302","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(devtools): add hermetic release build environment\" (#63302)"},{"Id":"3339530576","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T21:14:07","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"63300","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(forms): add support for binding to select","State":"closed","Body":"Adds test for select, and textarea (which was untested)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63300","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(forms): add support for binding to select\" (#63300)"},{"Id":"3339436363","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T20:39:27","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"63299","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump Angular DevTools version to 1.0.43","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63299","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump Angular DevTools version to 1.0.43\" (#63299)"},{"Id":"3339370708","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T19:55:47","Actor":"leonsenft","Number":"63298","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(forms): enable tree shaking of unused errors and properties","State":"open","Body":"The `ValidationError` and `AggregateProperty` classes used static factory methods to create instances. This pattern created a hard dependency from the base classes to all of their subclasses and variations.\r\n\r\nAs a result, any application importing even a single validator (e.g., required) or property would inadvertently pull in the code for all other validators and properties, preventing effective tree-shaking and increasing bundle size.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring removes the static factory methods and replaces them with standalone, exported functions or properties.

When set to `true`, pnpm will remove unused catalog entries during installation [#&#8203;9793](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9793).\n- Automatically load pnpmfiles from config dependencies that are named `@*/pnpm-plugin-*` [#&#8203;9780](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9780).\n- `pnpm config get` now prints an INI string for an object value [#&#8203;9797](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9797).\n- `pnpm config get` now accepts property paths (e.g. `pnpm config get catalog.react`, `pnpm config get .catalog.react`, `pnpm config get 'packageExtensions[\"@&#8203;babel/parser\"].peerDependencies[\"@&#8203;babel/types\"]'`), and `pnpm config set` now accepts dot-leading or subscripted keys (e.g. `pnpm config set .ignoreScripts true`).\n- `pnpm config get --json` now prints a JSON serialization of config value, and `pnpm config set --json` now parses the input value as JSON.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** When automatically installing missing peer dependencies, prefer versions that are already present in the direct dependencies of the root workspace package [#&#8203;9835](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9835).\n- When executing the `pnpm create` command, must verify whether the node version is supported even if a cache already exists [#&#8203;9775](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9775).\n- When making requests for the non-abbreviated packument, add `*/*` to the `Accept` header to avoid getting a 406 error on AWS CodeArtifact [#&#8203;9862](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9862).\n- The standalone exe version of pnpm works with glibc 2.26 again [#&#8203;9734](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9734).\n- Fix a regression in which `pnpm dlx pkg --help` doesn't pass `--help` to `pkg` [#&#8203;9823](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9823).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

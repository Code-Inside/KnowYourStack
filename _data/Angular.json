I made this change because the todo-item component had an accessibility problem: it was a list item component that rendered an `li` into its own template. This meant that the component's host element was in between the `ul` and the `li`, which is invalid. The \"right\" way to do this would have been to use a component with an attribute selector, but this isn't something that fits into the _Essentials_ guide.\r\n* Reorder some of the concepts in the components topic\r\n* Combine \"Rendering dynamic templates\", \"Conditionals and loops\", and \"Handling user interaction\" into one topic, \"Dynamic interfaces with templates\". Having these as separate topics meant that there was more preamble/scaffolding around these relatively straightforward ideas. * Renamed the \"Sharing logic\" topic to \"Modular design with dependency injection\". Aside from this, I have made no meaningful changes to the DI topic; I may come back for another edit pass here, but this is not necessary for v19.\r\n* Add a link to the in-depth guide for each _Essentials_ topic.\r\n* Add a new introduction to the _Essentials_ overview that explains what this guide is and what it's trying to accomplish.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58603","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update essentials guide to include signals\" (#58603)"},{"Id":"2650609894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T23:13:12","Actor":"sharakouze","Number":"58602","RawContent":null,"Title":"resource signal : have a way to make value() to persists while loading","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nMy typical use case is a resource loading data for a sortable table like this :\n\n```typescript\nreadonly tableResource = resource({\n    request: () => ({\n      sort: this.sort(),\n    }),\n    loader: async ({ request }) => {\n      const { sort } = request;\n      const response = await fetch(`http://localhost/api/test?sort=${sort}`);\n      return await response.json() as TableData[];\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOn the first execution when the data is loaded, _tableResource.value()_ contains my initial data.\n\nWhen the user sort the table, the _sort_ signal is changed therefore the tableResource reloads the data. \n\nWhile the loader function is running, _tableResource.value()_ is set to **undefined**, then when the data is loaded _tableResource.value()_ contains my new sorted data.\n\nI think this is the expected behavior but I have 2 problem with this :\n\n1/ If the fetch function is slow to return a value, the user will see all the table content disappearing (because the resource value changes to undefined) before it shows again.\nI think its best if the \"old\" data stays on the screen while it's loading (even if there is a loading indicator)\n\n2/ If I want to use a linkedSignal with the resource value, it will be called twice for only one reload\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think It would be nice if there was a way to force value to persists while it's loading (like when we call the reload() function)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nTesting status() === 'ResourceStatus.Loading' and storing previous value outside resource","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"resource signal : have a way to make value() to persists while loading\" (#58602)"},{"Id":"2650481392","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T21:49:55","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"58601","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): add incremental hydration tests","State":"open","Body":"This adds some additional tests for incremental hydration around registry and contract cleanup.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58601","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(core): add incremental hydration tests\" (#58601)"},{"Id":"2650449889","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T21:30:30","Actor":"wartab","Number":"58600","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): Add support for multiple conditions for cases in switch control flow","State":"open","Body":"Currently, the @switch/@case syntax is fairly limited, as cases may only have one guard.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe commit fixes the issue #38778, allowing a HTML custom element defined via `angular/elements` to be disconnected from the DOM for indefinite time and then re-connected without breaking it.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior (correctly) destroys the Angular component after 10ms of grace time after receiving the disconnected event. This event can be called if the element is directly disconnected from his parent, or even when a larger DOM tree is disconnected and \"parked\" in memory for future reattach.\r\n\r\nSince the mission of the Angular custom element support is to adhere to the W3C standards and write completely reusable Angular component for interoperability with other frameworks, it can be expected that detached DOM structures that contains a Angular element would be working even after reattaching the tree later on.\r\n\r\nDestroying the Angular component when the HTML element is disconnected is correct, since it correctly frees all the resources and allow GC reclaiming of the orphan node.\r\n\r\nHowever the current behavior of the `componentRef.destroy()` is to detach the Element node from his parent. This causes the issue, since the whole tree - when re-connected back later on - won't contain the custom element anymore, causing the issue.\r\n\r\nSimply letting the `NgElementImpl` instance to remain attached to his parent mainly fixes the issue of the missing connected callback not called.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to allow a \"non-detaching\" version of `destroy()`, the proposed fix simply reattach the HTML Custom Element instance back to the DOM in the original position immediately after the `componentRef.destroy()`. This limits the fix to the `elements` package only. I'm not sure if there are some internal utilities to save/restore a node position in the DOM tree, so I used low-level DOM calls to do that.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n          // Save old position of the element node, to maintain it attached even\r\n          // after the this.componentRef.destroy, that detach it from parent\r\n          const attachInfo = this.getElementAttachPoint();\r\n\r\n          this.componentRef.destroy();\r\n          this.componentRef = null;\r\n\r\n          // Reattach the destroyed empty html element to the parent\r\n          if (attachInfo) {\r\n            const { parent, viewNode, beforeOf } = attachInfo;\r\n            parent.insertBefore(viewNode, beforeOf);\r\n         }          \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the node will receive the \"connected\" event again later, the Angular component should be able to be recreated again from scratch, using the element properties and attributes, exactly like it was the first initialization. The extensive unit test suite already in `elements` is clear about the intent of element reuse, so the fix looks legit.\r\n\r\nHowever, an additional fix is required to let the custom element to not lose the property values. The hosting framework will probably expect the custom element properties to remain in sync, considering the HTML Element implementation as a black box. This is something probably not fully documented in the W3C specs, but when disconnected a custom element should ideally retain his public property values like any other `HTMLElement` instance.\r\n\r\nFor that, I added a function to copy back input property values from the Component instance to `initialInputValues` immediately before the destruction. I foresee some possible issue about the inputs that uses the `transform` callback.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  private resetProperties() {\r\n    this.componentFactory.inputs.forEach(input => {\r\n      this.initialInputValues.set(input.propName, this.componentRef!.instance[input.propName]);\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't see any inverted transform function available for inputs, so if we want 100% be sure that the properties are stored back properly the only working solution is to keep the  `initialInputValues` set always in sync with the passed values (the risk in that case is to use more memory for properties that are supposed to only store volatile data decoded on-the-fly by the input).\r\n\r\nLast line changed is in `platform-browser`, unfortunately, since the `ShadowDomRendered` must cope with the Element reuse in case of later reconnection. It seems that the W3C specs don't allow `shadowRoot` to be destroyed and then recreated, so the `attachShadow` would raise an exception if called on a element with already a shadow root present. \r\n\r\nThe proposed fix there requires a clear of the node content in case of reuse, otherwise duplicated nodes can be created (at least this happened in my tests).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    if (!this.shadowRoot) {\r\n      this.shadowRoot = (hostEl as Element).attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\r\n    } else {\r\n      // In case of custom elements, it is possible that the host element was already initialized during the\r\n      // element life-cycle (after a disconnect/reconnect)\r\n      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = \"\";\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've added an additional integration test `reconnect_spec.ts` to test the following cases:\r\n\r\n* Direct disconnect/reconnect of the custom element node\r\n* Indirect disconnect/reconnect via disconnection from parent node\r\n* Test of components with shadow DOM and slots.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] Not sure\r\n\r\nI don't know how many Angular features can break this fix, since a complete coverage for Angular components should be tested in the `elements` module.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't expect regressions, since the current issue doesn't allow the nodes to be reused at all at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Different fix approaches\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid potential regressions due to the change, the fix could be introduced in different ways:\r\n\r\n### Setting\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to enable/disable such behavior via some setting exposed in the `NgElementConfig`. This would require some little documentation of the current behavior and the new one, to allow backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Inheritance\r\n\r\nThe current public `NgElementStrategy` interface is more or less enough to implement an alternative version of `ComponentNgElementStrategy` with the fix, directly in the app.\r\nHowever this requires ~500 LOC to be copy/pasted in the app, and this is obviously subject to future fixes/evolutions, due to fact that these classes are mainly the core of `angular/elements`.\r\n\r\nA viable intermediate solution is to expose the `ComponentNgElementStrategy` in public API as default implementation, to allow:\r\n\r\n* override of the destroy behavior\r\n* or exposing flags.\r\n\r\nHowever this solution will require - again - quite extensive documentation of the current internal behavior.\r\n\r\nThanks, L\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58586","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(elements): allow custom elements to be detached and reattached\" (#58586)"},{"Id":"2646958905","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-10T07:46:03","Actor":"soc221b","Number":"58580","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): support for object in queryParams","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example `3.22.11` was the first `v3` release and is functionally identical to `2.22.11`. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.\n\n#### 3.27.1 - 08 Nov 2024\n\n-   The CodeQL Action now downloads bundles compressed using Zstandard on GitHub Enterprise Server when using Linux or macOS runners. This speeds up the installation of the CodeQL tools. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. [#&#8203;2573](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2573)\n-   Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.3.

The esbuild configuration pre-configured the builder with the angular-devkit/build-angular:application option. If I run ng serve with this configuration the microfrontend works, but unfortunately I would need the browser-esbuild option and this is where the problem arises.\nSo by configuring angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild and changing the key from options.browser to options.main and then starting ng serve I get the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n\nChanging again from options.main to options.browser (not noticing that it warns you by saying: the browser property is not allowed.) and running ng serve again gives me:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nAnother test I performed is deleting the options.main/options.browser key and running ng serve again gives me the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nEven initializing the microfrontend with --type remote gives the same problem\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nreproducing this error is simple: \n- make a new app\n- install @angular-architects/native-federation library (my version is 18.2.2)\n- initialize the microfrontend with ng g @angular-architects/native-federation:init --type host\n- change in angular.json file architect.esbuild.builder: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\n- change from options.browser to options.main\n- ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 22.0.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use angular native federation with builder configuration: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\" (#28837)"},{"Id":"2644271472","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T09:21:24","Actor":"HazzMan2409","Number":"28821","RawContent":null,"Title":"What happened to javascript proxy configuration?","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIt looks like the proxy configuration being written in javascript is no longer supported.

option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating **@angular** to v19, I’ve encountered a ton SCSS compiler deprecation warnings across many of my Angular projects. This issue occurs because the “_sass_” dependency in **@angular/build/package.json** was updated from “_1.77.6_” to “_1.80.6_”. As a temporary workaround, I reverted this dependency to “_1.77.6_” in the project’s node_modules directory, although this is - quite obvious - not ideal.\n\nIdeally, we should remove deprecated SCSS code in our scss files and 3rd party dependencies (this is where it becomes a nightmare). However, as a temporary solution to silence these deprecation warnings and be relieved when running “_ng s_“, it would be helpful to pass a “**stylePreprocessorOptions**” (already exists) flag via “_angular.json_“ into the Sass compiler.\n\nPlease note that in Nuxt/Vite and Ember, disabling these deprecation warnings is already possible, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67812380/disable-dart-sass-warnings-produced-by-external-theme-file) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78997907/the-legacy-js-api-is-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-dart-sass-2-0-0).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdditional option in “angular.json\". (Should default to false.)\n\n```\n\"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n  \"silenceDeprecations\": true\n},\n```\n\nThis should result in passing the flag \"--quiet-deps\" to the sass compiler. How to silence this warnings internally can be learned here: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#silencing-deprecations-in-dependencies\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDowngrade sass dep to “1.77.6“.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add style preprocessor option to disable deprecation warnings in Sass for V19\" (#28829)"},{"Id":"2645257155","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-09T07:19:46","Actor":"zrsio4","Number":"28826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 18 build --watch does not remove previous files when output hashing is used","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nI realize the title is almost word for word the same as #5846, but since that is 7 years old and for version 4, I figure creating a new case is ok.

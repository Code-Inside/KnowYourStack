This means that every time the status of the form changes (i.e. disabled/enabled), a new value is emitted even though the raw value itself hasn't changed. Ideally, there would be a simple way to listen for just raw value changes so that you could use the raw value for output emissions.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a `rawValueChanges` method.\n\n```ts\n  protected readonly formModified = output<{ firstName: string | null; lastName: string | null }>();\n\n  protected readonly form = new FormGroup({\n    firstName: new FormControl('John'),\n    lastName: new FormControl('Doe')\n  });\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.form.rawValueChanges\n      .pipe(takeUntilDestroyed())\n      .subscribe(rawValue => this.formModified.emit(rawValue));\n  }\n```\n\nThis would allow a user to still enable/disable the form without emitting the same value twice.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing a custom `distinctUntilChanged` pipe to handle values.\n\n```ts\n  protected readonly formModified = output<{ firstName: string | null; lastName: string | null }>();\n\n  protected readonly form = new FormGroup({\n    firstName: new FormControl('John'),\n    lastName: new FormControl('Doe')\n  });\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.form.valueChanges\n      .pipe(\n        takeUntilDestroyed(),\n        startWith(this.form.getRawValue()),\n        map(() => this.form.getRawValue()),\n        distinctUntilChanged((a, b) => JSON.stringify(a) === JSON.stringify(b)),\n        skip(1)\n      )\n      .subscribe(rawValue => this.formModified.emit(rawValue));\n  }\n```\n\nThis isn't ideal: it requires the use of JSON.stringify to ensure deeper comparison (allowing FormGroup or FormArray comparison to work). It's also a lot of logic that could be easily avoided by simply having a separate observable to watch the raw value.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61845","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New `rawValueChanges` Observable for ReactiveFormsModule\" (#61845)"},{"Id":"3111891645","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-03T15:22:14","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"61835","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename FieldDirective to Control","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Rename FieldDirective to Control\" (#61835)"},{"Id":"3114258423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-03T14:37:14","Actor":"gabrielbergoc","Number":"61844","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: `valueChanges` emits the initial value","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nWhen working with reactive forms, I find myself writing over and over again something like\n\n```ts\nthis.form.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(this.form.value)).subscribe(...)\n```\n\nCould this be reworked to always emit the initial value so that this is abbreviated?\n\nThe current behavior could easily be achieved with `skip(1)`, of course it would just move the \"boilerplate\" to the other use case, but I wanted to see if this is something worth discussing, or it's just me that uses the former case much more frequently than the latter (or even if I'm missing some easier way to achieve the behavior that I want).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNew usage:\n```ts\nthis.form.valueChanges.subscribe(/* subscription receives all values starting with the initial value of the form */)\nthis.form.valueChanges.pipe(skip(1)).subscribe(/* how to get current behavior */)\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've seen some discussion about adding signals to forms, I think it would be a great alternative, because in a lot of cases, I'm using the `valueChanges` with `toSignal`, so this would already save a lot of repetitive code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: `valueChanges` emits the initial value\" (#61844)"},{"Id":"3113512537","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-03T14:36:49","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61841","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rules_angular digest to 8c799e8 (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| rules_angular | git_repository | digest | `e0f7af7` -> `8c799e8` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I've made an event plugin to do the same for all events, like \"scroll.zoneless\" – this way I could listen to scroll events and not care about change detection being run. It is helpful for events like that, which are triggered very rapidly (`mousemove` is another example). Scroll event is fired multiple times in a frame and if all I want is to, say, sync scroll position on two elements and in my callback all I do is call `secondElement.scrollLeft = firstElement.scrollLeft` I do not need to notify the change detection mechanism. Currently, if I understand correctly, every (event) listener will trigger change detection in zoneless app. There should be a way to circumvent that.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a built-in event modifier like .silent or something similar that would let Angular know this event should be ignored in terms of running checks on the view.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nSubscribing to events manually which is very bad DX.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61839","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"Silent\" way to listen to events in zoneless\" (#61839)"},{"Id":"3112303709","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-03T04:01:59","Actor":"mAbduqayum","Number":"61837","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add bunx for angular installation","State":"open","Body":"In some linux distros you can't just use npm/bun install directly.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Introduction to the Stackblitz project:\n\n1. GimmeComponent is a component with the effect in question. It reacts to value changes and status changes of an AbstractControl. \"Test 1\" is a working effect: as soon as the value or the status changes, it triggers a console log and counts a counter up.  \"Test 2\" is the same but with a different condition order and it doesn't work even though (to me) it should.\n2. AppComponent is the component using Gimme. It includes a \"test\" button that just sets a custom error on the FormGroup in question. There is also a validator that reports an error whenever the field is empty.\n\n**Steps to reproduce the bug**:\n1. Input any one character into the input field so the FormGroup validator says it's valid (e.g. number or letter).\n2. Click the \"test\" button to invalidate the FormGroup.\n3. Remove the input from the field, so the FormGroup switches from one invalid state (set by the button in step 2) to another invalid state (set by the validator being mad at a now empty field).\n\n**Expected result**: \"Valid?\" & \"Errors\" get updated and \"if clause in effect triggered\" counts up.\nWith the effect in \"Test 1\" in GimmeComponent, **it works as expected**. With the effect in \"Test 2\", **it doesn't**, even though the only difference is the order of the conditions. \"Valid?\" and \"Errors\" get updated by Angular itself, but the counter is what's important.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ftahpx37?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nWhatever Stackblitz is using and Angular v20. (reproduceable in v17-20)\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI'm sure it's possible to make the example even simpler and still show the bug happening but that's as minimal as I got it.

The error occurs during the package loading\n  phase, specifically in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer dependency.\n\n\n  Root Cause Analysis\n\n  The issue appears to be in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer@2.0.18 package that's a dependency of @angular/cli@19.2.14. The error occurs at line 30:62 in the compiled JavaScript\n  where it's trying to extend a class that's undefined.\n\n  This suggests:\n  1. Missing or incompatible inquirer dependency\n  2. Version mismatch between @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer and its peer dependencies\n  3. Potential ESM/CommonJS module resolution issue\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n  Steps to Reproduce\n\n  1. Create an Angular 19.2.14 project or use existing one\n  2. Run ng add @angular/ssr --project=<project-name>\n  3. Error occurs during \"Loading package information from registry\" phase\n\n  Workaround\n\n  The issue can be bypassed by:\n  1. Manually installing @angular/ssr via npm install @angular/ssr --legacy-peer-deps\n  2. Manually creating the required SSR configuration files following the documentation\n  3. Updating angular.json manually for SSR build configuration\n\n  Expected Behavior\n\n  The ng add @angular/ssr command should successfully add server-side rendering support to the project without errors.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError Details\n\n  $ ng add @angular/ssr --project=marketplace-app\n  ✔ Determining Package Manager\n    › Using package manager: npm\n  ✔ Searching for compatible package version\n    › Found compatible package version: @angular/ssr@19.2.14.\n  ✔ Loading package information from registry\n  ✖ Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n  An unhandled exception occurred: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n  See \"/tmp/ng-xYMb4w/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\n\n  Error Log Contents:\n  [error] TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n      at Object.<anonymous> (/home/ubuntu/xxxxx/node_modules/@listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer/dist/index.cjs:30:62)\n      at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1730:14)\n      at Object..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1895:10)\n      at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1465:32)\n      at Function._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1282:12)\n      at TracingChannel.traceSync (node:diagnostics_channel:322:14)\n      at wrapModuleLoad (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:235:24)\n      at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1487:12)\n      at require (node:internal/modules/helpers:135:16)\n      at /home/ubuntu/xxxxx/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.js:265:108\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nEnvironment\n\n  - Angular CLI: 19.2.14\n  - Angular: 19.2.14\n  - Node: (include your version)\n  - Package Manager: npm\n  - OS: Linux (WSL2)\n  - Project: Multi-project workspace with existing Angular 19.2.14 applications\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n  Additional Context\n\n  - This issue persists even after clearing npm cache and reinstalling Angular CLI\n  - The error is consistent across multiple attempts\n  - Using --legacy-peer-deps for other npm operations works fine\n  - The project has some Angular 18-compatible dependencies that were temporarily removed to isolate the issue\n\n  Relevant Repository: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\n  Component: ng add command / SSR schematic","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30448","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng add @angular/ssr fails with \"Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\" error\" (#30448)"},{"Id":"3104897204","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-02T20:16:41","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30431","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rules_angular digest to e0f7af7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| rules_angular | git_repository | digest | `8952a28` -> `e0f7af7` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It also requires a change from a relative path\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nto an absolute path:\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('/assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nTo allow for a smooth migration process and not to require changes to the application code, it would be best if the Vitest test runner would default to not using the additional path segment or at least to provide a configuration option.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create src/assets/image/help.svg\n1. Change angular.json to include architect.build.options.assets: [\"src/assets\"]\n1.

Based on a quick browse of `packages/angular/build/src/builders/unit-test/builder.ts` there doesn't seem to be a way to pass configuration settings.\n\nFor this to be even slightly usable, you would need to set vitest options such as:\n- timeouts\n- setupFiles\n- coverage (specify lcov reporter)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nOne option is letting people pass vitest options in `angular.json` and doing a deep object merge.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPersonally I would rather see less obfuscation... let people have a `vitest.config.ts`.\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vitest/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {}\n});\n```\n\nYou could add a plugin (like `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular`)\n\nYou could also provide an angular`defineConfig`.

The build used to generate the following files (among others):\n\n- index.d.ts, which exported everything from public_api;\n- public_api.d.ts, which imported './jasmine-matchers' and exported everything from a bunch of other files;\n- jasmine-matchers.d.ts, defining the additional matchers\n\nAfter the upgrade, the build only has an index.d.ts, where doesn't contain any sign of the jasmine matchers.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos.git\ngit checkout chore/ng20\npnpm i\npnpm ng build --project ngx-speculoos\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 20.19.2\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.11.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nng-packagr                   20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30425","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing typing in library after upgrade to v20\" (#30425)"},{"Id":"3102096534","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T07:31:27","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30424","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency aspect_bazel_lib to v2.17.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | patch | `v2.17.0` -> `v2.17.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/bazel-lib (aspect_bazel_lib)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.17.1`](https://redirect.github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-lib/releases/tag/v2.17.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v2.17.0...v2.17.1)\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\n1.

While this behavior aligns with accessibility guidelines (WCAG), it creates a **usability issue** for the user interface.\n\nThe `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are not merely decorative animations — they are **functional indicators** of background activity (e.g., data loading, request processing). Disabling animations entirely when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled renders these components static, which can mislead users into thinking the interface is \"frozen\" or unresponsive. This is especially problematic in **single-page applications (SPAs)**, where these components often serve as replacements for native browser loading indicators.\n\nI intentionally enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in Windows 10 to reduce distracting or resource-heavy animations, such as window transitions. However, even with this setting enabled, browsers like **Firefox** and **Chrome** still provide **minimal animations** (e.g., tab loading spinners) to indicate progress. In SPAs, where we rely on custom loading indicators like `mat-progress-bar`, the absence of any animation severely impacts UX.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active, the `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` components in `indeterminate` mode should support a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** to maintain their role as activity indicators. For example:\n\n- **mat-progress-bar**: A subtle bar movement or pulsation, avoiding abrupt transitions.\n- **mat-progress-spinner**: A slow rotation or pulsation instead of complete animation disablement.\n\nAdditionally, developers should be able to **opt-in** to minimal animations via:\n\n- Module configuration (`MatProgressBarModule`, `MatProgressSpinnerModule`)\n- Token-based control (e.g., `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS`)\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting in **Windows 10**:\n   - Go to **Settings → Ease of Access → Display**\n   - Turn off **\"Show animations in Windows\"**\n\n2. Create an Angular application using **Angular Material 20**.\n\n3. Add a `mat-progress-bar` or `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode:\n\n    ```html\n    <mat-progress-bar mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-bar>\n    <mat-progress-spinner mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-spinner>\n    ```\n\n4. Open the app in a browser (e.g., **Firefox**).\n\n5. Observe that both components are **completely static**, even during ongoing tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Actual Result\n\nWith `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled, animations for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are **fully disabled**, causing the interface to appear **unresponsive** or **frozen**.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Result\n\nThese components should display a **minimal, accessibility-compliant animation** to indicate ongoing activity (e.g., slow movement or pulsation), rather than being completely static.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Angular Material**: 20.0.1  \n- **Angular**: 20.0.0  \n- **Browser**: Firefox (latest), Chrome (latest)  \n- **OS**: Windows 10  \n- **prefers-reduced-motion**: `reduce` (enabled manually)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- This issue is reproducible on the **Angular Material docs site** ([material.angular.dev](https://material.angular.dev)).\n- Attempts to override the behavior via CSS or the `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS` token were **unsuccessful**.\n- Even in `prefers-reduced-motion` mode, browsers show **minimal tab loading animations**, emphasizing the need for similar UX in SPAs.\n- Possibly related PR: [#30796](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30796) — automatic handling of `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\n- ✅ Implement a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active.\n- ✅ Provide a **configuration option** (e.g., via module or DI token) to **enable minimal animations** under `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n- ✅ **Document** this behavior clearly in the Angular Material documentation and offer guidance for **customization**.\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Minimal Animation for mat-progress-bar and mat-progress-spinner in indeterminate Mode with prefers-reduced-motion Enabled\" (#31265)"},{"Id":"3104347911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T21:52:02","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31264","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: merge light/dark color config definition","State":"open","Body":"No-op refactoring to reduce the duplicate implementation for creating a light or dark theme config","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31264","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: merge light/dark color config definition\" (#31264)"},{"Id":"3102891356","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T15:16:16","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31261","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/card): subtitle text token should be on-surface-variant","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31261","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/card): subtitle text token should be on-surface-variant\" (#31261)"},{"Id":"3101819745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T01:05:23","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31258","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): Tree - preview","State":"open","Body":"This PR is used to preview the demo.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31258","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): Tree - preview\" (#31258)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-04T03:30:02.7700321Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1575}

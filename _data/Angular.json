If application-wide change detection\r\n(ApplicationRef.tick) is currently executing when this function is used,\r\nthe callback will execute as soon as all views attached to the\r\n`ApplicationRef` have been refreshed. Refreshing the application views\r\nwill happen again before `checkNoChanges` executes.\r\n\r\nWhen a change detection is _not_ running, this state update will execute\r\nin the microtask queue.\r\n\r\nThis function is necessary as a replacement for current\r\n`Promise.resolve().then(() => stateUpdate())` to be zoneless compatible\r\nwhile ensuring those state updates are synchronized to the DOM before\r\nthe browser repaint. Without this, updates done in `Promise.resolve(...)` would\r\nqueue another round of change detection in zoneless applications, and\r\nthis change detection could happen in the next browser frame, and cause\r\nnoticeable flicker for the user.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this function provides a way to perform state updates that\r\nwill run on the server as well as in the browser.\r\n\r\nLast, current applications using `ngZone: 'noop'` may not be\r\ncalling `ApplicationRef.tick` at all so this function provides a\r\nmechanism to ensure the state update still happens by racing\r\na microtask with `afterNextRender` (which might never execute).\r\n\r\n## commit 2\r\nEnsures that any internal render hooks that cause views to\r\nbecome dirty again first refresh those dirty views before running user\r\nrender hooks. This ensures that user render hooks have the most complete\r\nrender state possible and stops them from needlessly executing multiple\r\ntimes. This is important to maintain the goal of the public render\r\nhooks, which is to provide the safest place to place code that depends\r\non DOM state, especially in ways that may force a browser paint.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54224","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Queue state update\" (#54224)"},{"Id":"2115771391","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-02T20:44:17","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"54222","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(service-worker): avoid running CDs on `controllerchange`","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the implementation of `ngswAppInitializer` to configure the `controllerchange` event listener outside of the Angular zone.

That said, if the component with `ContentQuery` is `OnPush` and does not mark itself dirty, it will still not be refreshed.\r\n\r\nReading view queries directly in the owner template will still result in `ExpressionChanged...` errors because view queries are not updated until after the view executes.\r\n\r\nThis change cannot directly address all unidirectional data flow issues with classic `ViewQuery` and `ContentQuery`. However, it does serve to ensure the query results at least are correct and complete after change detection runs. Developers _can_ use the `.changes` observable to receive these changes and subsequently make updates to signals that are used in templates.

The function can be used to declare directive/component\r\noutputs without the use of decorators.

Points discussed below are not decided at all, and just additional considerations at this point\r\n\r\nCurrent *idea of design* will return an `OutputEmitter` instead of an `EventEmitter` with the goals of:\r\n\r\n* abstracting away RxJS and additional complexity introduced by `EventEmitter` implementing a `Subject`.\r\n* improving the `.emit` signature. `EventEmitter#emit` currently takes `T`, but also can be called without a value. This is confusing and might cause subtle bugs (see for example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bvs1rn?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\nAn additional consideration is to not expose `.subscribe` publicly. Conceptually aligning with signal inputs,\r\nwhere you can only write to outputs, while subscription is only possible for consumers via the template. A difficult question will be dynamically created components as those currently have no way to subscribe, unlike with signal inputs where users could reach for `ComponentRef#setInput`. This is something to explore. \r\n\r\n**Note**: We are still discussing design more closely and incorporating feedback from the RFC.

The development server now has a specific `prebundle` option to allow more control over prebundling while still allowing other forms of caching within the Angular CLI. The `prebundle` option can be a boolean value of `true` or `false` that will enable or disable prebundling, respectively. Additionally, the option also has an object long-form. This long-form enables prebundling and currently contains one property named `exclude`. The `exclude` property supports cases where a package should not be prebundled and rather should be bundled directly into the application code. These cases are not common but can happen based on project specific requirements. If the `prebundle` option is enabled when using the `browser` builder or any other Webpack-based builder, it will be ignored as the Webpack-based development server does not contain such functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow control of Vite-based development server

I prepared a simple repo here: https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss . The crucial part is here https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss/blob/master/src/app/scss/utils.scss .`utils.css` is file that is being imported into `app.component.scss`. Relative path from `utils.scss` to `angular.png` is `../../angular.png` and when it is directly used inside `url()` function, it works. However if i define SCSS variable with the same path-value I'm getting error (path can't be resolved), also when it is changed to path relative to app.component.scss (`../angular.png`) it works again. \r\n\r\nIs the new behaviour intentional? \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Path declared in SCSS variable is incorrectly resolved\" (#27007)"},{"Id":"2109525248","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-31T15:04:19","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27004","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add output location in build stats","State":"closed","Body":"This can be used by users to determine where the output path is located without needing to read the angular.json.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27004","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add output location in build stats\" (#27004)"},{"Id":"2109885779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-31T13:55:08","Actor":"tom-vism","Number":"27005","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Angular + Tailwind] Tailwind css imports does not behave the same as before in newest Angular version","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNote: Recreating the issue with a repro scenario.\r\n\r\nStarting from Angular 15 tailwind does not work as before regarding imports (on the newest Angular version 17 too).\r\n\r\nPreviously, tailwind-specific CSS definitions were put in a separate file and then imported into the styles.css but that does not work anymore.

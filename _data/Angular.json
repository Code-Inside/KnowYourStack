Custom decorators can return a new class that extends the original once, which means that the `…µ…µgetInheritedFactory` call will now resolve to the factory of the `Child`, causing an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThese changes fix the issue by changing the inherited factory resolution logic so that it walks up the prototype chain class-by-class, while skipping classes that have the same factory as the class that was passed in.\r\n\r\nFixes #35733.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): infinite loop if injectable using inheritance has a custom decorator\" (#37561)"},{"Id":"637829252","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T22:09:03","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"37556","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(dev-infra): add `#` to outputed list of PRs for discover-new-conflicts","State":"closed","Body":"Adding in a `#` prepended to each PR number in the list of conflicting PRs\r\nfound by the discover-new-conflicts script will allow for users to copy\r\npaste the output from the script into a github comment and have the PRs\r\nautomatically link.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37556","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(dev-infra): add `#` to outputed list of PRs for discover-new-conflicts\" (#37556)"},{"Id":"637955274","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T22:08:13","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"37560","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: upload build results to ResultStore for CI linux bazel executions","State":"closed","Body":"Bazel invocations will upload to ResultStore to allow for us to have better viewing\r\nof execution/build logs.

After reading the API docs and [issue #17902](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17902) I found out that [`SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader`](https://angular.io/api/router/testing/SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader) is what I need to test my lazy-loaded modules. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the discussion of that issue @burtonjc proposed a [different approach](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17902#issuecomment-385509867) to the one used in the API docs. He says:\r\n\r\n> The linked docs use router.resetConfig which blows away the actual routes you are trying to test. This means you could delete your routes in source code and the tests will still pass (not ideal). We were looking to test our actual lazy route while still stubbing the lazy loading of the module.\r\n\r\nAnd the implementation is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({ template: '' })\r\n  class LazyLoadedComponent { }\r\n\r\n  @NgModule({ declarations: [ LazyLoadedComponent ]})\r\n  class LazyModule { }\r\n\r\n  it('lazily navigates to \"/project/create\"', fakeAsync(() => {\r\n    const loader = TestBed.get(NgModuleFactoryLoader);\r\n    loader.stubbedModules = {\r\n      './create-project/create-project.module#CreateProjectModule': LazyModule,\r\n    };\r\n    spy(loader, 'load');\r\n\r\n    router.navigate(['project', 'create']);\r\n\r\n    tick();\r\n    expect(location.path()).to.equal('/project/create');\r\n    expect(loader.load).to.have.been.calledOnce;\r\n    expect(loader.load).to.have.been.calledWith('./create-project/create-project.module#CreateProjectModule');\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to use the suggested approach, in order to test the actual routes of my routing module instead of resetting them through `router.resetConfig()`. However, **when you specify [`LoadChildren`](https://angular.io/api/router/LoadChildren) in the routing module, the new standard way is to employ a [callback to load the module](https://angular.io/api/router/LoadChildrenCallback), and the [string path](https://angular.io/api/router/DeprecatedLoadChildren) that one can also use in [`loader.stubbedModules`](https://angular.io/api/router/testing/SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader#properties) is now deprecated. This means that there is no way to load stubbed modules using the actual routes of my routing module.**\r\n\r\n### Solution I'd like\r\nI would like to know if there is a way to update the implementation of `SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader` to allow for the requirements above. One should be able to pass the routing module's actual routes to `RouterTestingModule` and use `loader.stubbedModules` to specify stubbed lazy loaded modules without resetting the actual routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n- Reset routes through `router.resetConfig()`, as the docs suggest. The problem with this is that I don't know what I'm testing, since the tests end up covering only my test doubles and lose all connection to the actual code of my routing module.\r\n\r\n- Test routing only through integration tests. I know this is an option, but I think there is room for some coverage through unit tests, especially if something like `SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader` already exists. I want to test some simple aspects of the behavior of my routing module without depending on the implementation of external routing/routed components and modules.\r\n\r\n- Revert to the deprecated string path for `LoadChildren`. This would work, but it would be an unwanted alteration of my production code for the sake of testing. It could work as a provisional solution until an update like the proposed here can be implemented.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37553","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature request] Update SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader to allow for testing of actual routing module's routes\" (#37553)"},{"Id":"637639812","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T13:44:25","Actor":"alogim","Number":"37550","RawContent":null,"Title":"Local project shows Circular dependency detected warning but Stackblitz does not","State":"closed","Body":"I am not sure which is the most appropriate section where to report this.\r\n\r\nI have a very simple example on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-routing-demo-5) where I tried to use routing and children. \r\nI have two modules, the app-module and an authorisations module, with three children routes.\r\n\r\nWhile the Stackblitz example works without returning any problem, if I try to run the same project locally on my machine it returns the following Warning:\r\n\r\n> WARNING in Circular dependency detected:\r\nsrc/app/authorisations/authorisations-routing.module.ts -> src/app/authorisations/authorisations/authorisations.component.ts -> src/app/authorisations/authorisations-routing.module.ts\r\n\r\n> WARNING in Circular dependency detected:\r\nsrc/app/authorisations/authorisations/authorisations.component.ts -> src/app/authorisations/authorisations-routing.module.ts -> src/app/authorisations/authorisations/authorisations.component.ts\r\n\r\nI would like to fix this problem, if it is not a bug on my local machine.\r\nThank you in advance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37550","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Local project shows Circular dependency detected warning but Stackblitz does not\" (#37550)"},{"Id":"637724532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T13:39:42","Actor":"rangatejagolla","Number":"37552","RawContent":null,"Title":"Calling both @HostListener('window:unload', ['$event']) and @HostListener('window:beforeunload', ['$event']) on browser refresh","State":"closed","Body":"Issue: **Calling both @HostListener('window:unload', ['$event']) and @HostListener('window:beforeunload', ['$event']) on browser refresh**\r\n\r\ni want to clear the local storage on browser close but not on the page refresh in angular 6\r\n\r\nI have written clearing the local storage logic in \"unload\" only but it is clearing on the page refresh.

I have a form with some required fields. \"On blur\" triggers validation. Underneath each field, there is a div showing an error message when there is an error. The submit button should always be clickable. \r\n\r\nWhen a required field now has focus, and I click on the submit button (through moving the mouse, so *not* using the [tab] key), the 'error' message is shown, but the submit button itself does not call its submit() method.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the field's blur event is triggered first, which makes the form rerender. Should the error message *not* push the submit button down the page, the submit button's click event would be captured after the rerender of the page, and all would be fine. \r\n\r\nNote that if I would trigger the submit button through a 'mousedown' event, it works.

This was not an issue with v9.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginally reported in rules_nodejs: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932. I'll summarize the the main points here.\r\n\r\n@alan-agius4 did some preliminary analysis:\r\n\r\n\"This is the result that In version 10, incremental type-checking was introduced in Ivy, instead of a global type-checking file we now have a type-checking file for each file.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems here that I can see here.\r\n\r\nIn tsc_wrapped, the return of setupCompilation is ignored. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/blob/c4b325859b8d2c0579b094c67f449f1c3143271e/internal/tsc_wrapped/tsc_wrapped.ts#L389 This returns 2 pieces of information, files are shouldn't be emitted and files which shouldn't be checked for diagnostics. This will cause 2 extra files to be emitted for each original source file. myfile.ngtypecheck.d.ts and myfile.ngtypecheck.js.\r\n\r\nIn the TS source file, a triple-slash reference to the type-checking file is added, however this is not removed when emitting the DTS, this seems to be more of a bug in the plugin itself.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if maybe the first issue should be handled directly by NG Compiler, maybe sometime similar to ngtsc.wrapHost, because I am seeing that anyone who uses the plugin API will need to filter out those files from being emitted.\r\n\r\nI did create a reproduction without Bazel https://github.com/alan-agius4/ngtsc-plugin-demo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed the fix itself needs to happen at a NG plugin level, Unless you want to add temporary patch in rules_typescript.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not clear to me who will address point 1 in rules_typescript.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had a chat with Alex R, he mentioned that the plugin is still experimental/in development and is not production ready and not surprised at all that there are such issues since the plugin API itself is not complete (it‚Äôs about half way there) nor rigorously tested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSo far this is reproduced in a rules_nodejs PR: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932\r\n\r\nIts a bit tricky to run in there so

This seems to go against the precedent that has been set, wherein both AOT and JIT give compiler errors if you attempt to build with lambda expressions or non exported functions.\r\n\r\nSee example code below.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nServe commands with arguments I used.\r\n \r\n```\r\nng serve -c=debug\r\nng serve -c=debug --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Route\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'someroute',\r\n    component: SomeComponent,\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    data: {\r\n      pageTitle: 'Some | Title',\r\n      doesShowUpWithAOT: doesShowUpWithAOT,\r\n      // throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT, this behaves as expected\r\n      doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError() { // behaves inconsistently between JIT and AOT\r\n        console.log('foo');\r\n      },\r\n      // alsoThrowsCompilerErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: () => console.log('foo') this behaves as expected\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// code from within some class\r\nconstructor(private _route: ActivatedRoute, private _router: Router) {\r\n   this._router.events\r\n      .subcribe(event => {\r\n         if(event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\r\n               const data = this._route.snapshot.firstChild.data;\r\n               const functionMember = data['doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError']; // is null with AOT, properly defined with JIT\r\n         }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue, for the sake of consistency and explicitness, that both AOT and JIT should throw compiler errors, instead of the function making it through in JIT, and dropping away silently in AOT. I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Specifically, color support checking is now done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1cd51e64c7331a9cc48d59e8fd6df74d3c6c48f3/packages/angular/cli/utilities/color.ts#L11-L14\r\n\r\nAlas, when node is run within a MINGW terminal (as installed by git for windows), `process.stdout` is a `Socket`, causing `instanceof WriteStream` to return false, and all use of colors by the angular CLI to be disabled, even though the MINGW terminal supports colors just fine ...\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Typings do not contain the function call (added in Node.js v9.9.0)\r\nexport const supportsColor =\r\n  process.stdout instanceof WriteStream\r\n  && ((process.stdout as unknown) as { getColorDepth(): number }).getColorDepth() > 1 \r\n  || process.env.MSYSTEM; // MINGW terminals support color even though nodejs mistakes them for a Socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can submit a PR to that effect.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might prefer to delegate to angular_devkit/core/src/terminal/caps.ts instead, whose vendored implementation of `supportsColor` still contains my earlier fix. However, not knowing your policy for dependencies across npm packages I don't feel comfortable submitting a PR to that effect.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17924","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"webpack output is no longer colored in git bash (again)\" (#17924)"},{"Id":"637997471","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T20:51:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"17923","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): use type guard based narrowing in ast-utils","State":"open","Body":"By leveraging TypeScript's AST type guards, function parameter assumptions and casting can be removed.

Description\r\nHey\r\n\r\nCurrently I have been using Nginx with my Angular build and its directly pointed towards Angular output path i.e. /dist folder and serving it from there itself.\r\n\r\nBut what happens is when I run `ng build --prod` on the server then it remove the old build first from the output folder and then compile the new build from the source code and till the time the process completed my Nginx throws `internal server error`.\r\n\r\nI know the option `--deleteOutputPath=false` where you can specify ng build to not delete the output path files but it just keeps on adding files which I think is not a good option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere should be an option in ng build like `--preserveOutputPath=true` where if given will not delete any content from the output path until the compilation is done and then replaces the new build files with the old build files.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAs I am using Ansible to deploy and build angular app on server I have to specify different output path while building app and then replaces that one's files with the output path (/dist) files which is an additional task needed to perform.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option in ng build to preserve build files until compilation is

After run server I only see  \r\n> 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY INIT'\r\n> ..\r\n> [HPM] Subscribed to http-proxy events:  [ 'proxyRes', 'error', 'close' ]\r\n(if I use `bypass` I don't see 'proxyRes')\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust not works - header is not included to serwer response (and on server console I DON'T see 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY RUN' so I guess onProxyRes/bypass function is never  triggered).

I have to kill the \"ng serve\" and relaunch it to be able to see the library changes  .\r\nWhat's weird is that when I made change in library, the app watcher still detects that something has changed somewhere and rebuild the app.\r\nAlso changes made in the library controller are shown immediately, only changes in html and css will not show, and needs a kill + relaunch ng serve.\r\n\r\nI've searched in the node_module/library_folder (which is a symlink) and I do see the html/css changes in the sources.\r\n\r\nI do have the  \"preserveSymlinks\": true property in app's angular.json\r\nIvy is disabled for now.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 9.1.7\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.6\r\nNode: 13.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                       9.1.6\r\n@angular/flex-layout               9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                  9.2.3\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   9.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.6\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

This is the case for chromium on macOS, where\r\nthe browser test inputs (including chromium) are extracted from the remote cache, but\r\nnot fully so that the test action inputs will be incomplete on disk. Then later, the remote cache `SpawnResult` lookup for existing test results fails with an IO exception\r\n(as an input file is missing on disk when the merkle tree is built up).\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why this doesn't surface with RBE then. This is most likely\r\n(not confirmed) because the remote containers are linux based, and do not fail writing\r\nthese paths with a space when Bazel opens a file descriptor through a JNI wrapper.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: This fixes an issue where chromium tests cannot be run in macOS.\r\nHence marked as P2 to unblock impeded local development\r\n\r\nRelated sources for later

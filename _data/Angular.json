So I have tried : \r\n\r\n`ng update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --migrate-only`\r\n\r\nand I get the following error: `Incompatible peer dependencies found. See above` \r\n\r\n ```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/http\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), wouldinstall \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\nIncompatible peer dependencies found. See above.\r\n```\r\n \r\nSo I tried with `--force` flag and I do get my `package.json` file updated but I never see my `migration.json` schematic run. \r\n\r\n`g update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --force --migrate-only`\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency rxjs @ \"6.3.3\" (was \"6.2.2\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cdk @ \"6.4.7\" (was \"6.4.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/core @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/router @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/common @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure why my `ng update` command is not run. I wanted to test my `migration.json` schematic so I pointed my `collection.json` to point to `ng-update/index` so that when I run `ng add @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration@1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3` I can see if my `ng-update` code work and it does work as expected (Note: this was only to test purpose and I do not intend to use `ng add` to run migrations).

These changes add an alternate, opt-in, rendering strategy that'll keep the options inside the DOM. The rendering strategy is controlled through the `MAT_SELECT_RENDERING_STRATEGY` injection token.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the new rendering strategy, these changes introduce a new kind of portal called an `InlinePortal`. It is a portal whose content is transferred from one place in the DOM to another when it is attached/detached.\r\n\r\nAnother change that was necessary for the new rendering to work was being able to pass a portal to the `CdkConnectedOverlay` directive.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/19.0.0-next.1...19.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   Render default fallback with empty `projectableNodes`.\n\n    When passing an empty array to `projectableNodes` in the `createComponent` API, the default fallback content of the `ng-content` will be rendered if present. To prevent rendering the default content, pass `document.createTextNode('')` as a `projectableNode`.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    // The first ng-content will render the default fallback content if present\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[], [secondNode]] });\n\n    // To prevent projecting the default fallback content:\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[document.createTextNode('')], [secondNode]] });\n\n    ```\n-   The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid\n    mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization\n    when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone\n    above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests\n    which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync`\n    and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\n##### elements\n\n-   as part of switching away from custom CD behavior to the\n    hybrid scheduler, timing of change detection around custom elements has\n    changed subtly. These changes make elements more efficient, but can cause\n    tests which encoded assumptions about how or when elements would be checked\n    to require updating.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [50f08e6c4bf](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/50f08e6c4bf1caeeb08d3505ce7fabd466b9c76b) | feat | automatically use sizes auto in NgOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;57479](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57479)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4716c3b9660](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4716c3b9660b01f4ef3642fb774270b7f4a13d1a) | perf | reduce duplicate component style resolution ([#&#8203;57502](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57502)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a3cdbfe87f5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a3cdbfe87f5a8daef11a154ef3edb5a3a5c12f77) | fix | avoid leaking memory if component throws during creation ([#&#8203;57546](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/57546)) |\n| [7a99815146e](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7a99815146eb78074aa3ed6db73c6e87042df692) | fix | Do not bubble capture events.

This value was added in TypeScript 5.4 and is intended to model the behavior of modern bundlers such as used in the default `application` builder. This option value also has the advantage of automatically enabling `esModuleInterop` and setting `moduleResolution` to `bundler` which are the currently generated values for new projects. This allows explicit use of these options to be removed from the generated file. The `resolveJsonModule` option is also enabled with `preserve` which removes the need for developers to manually add it if JSON files are imported. JSON file imports are fully support including unused property treeshaking with named imports in the `application` builder.\r\nAdditional details on the option can be found here:

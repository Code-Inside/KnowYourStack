However HttpClient does not act that way which may cause unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nSpecifically while JSON (or another syntax) would clearly be needed to parse complex objects out of an API, simple types like string, boolean, and number might be intuitively expected to be parsed as text, not json.\r\n\r\nIssue #18672 showcases the confusion possible as does this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49771603/types-of-property-responsetype-are-incompatible\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhen these types are specified, HttpClient should default to \"text\" responseType option. Normally the generic version of these functions always expects JSON text. A user can still override the responseType back to \"json\" for the old behavior to shim old code.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThis solution could potentially cause breaking changes. number and boolean types would likely be unaffected as json and text forms of these types are identical. However string types are the general problem. That said, are there really any APIs that return a quoted string for Angular to parse as JSON? Who knows...\r\n\r\nOther alternative is to maintain this behavior. The current documentation at https://angular.io/guide/http#requesting-non-json-data covers this case but perhaps could be expanded on to explicitly warn that use of the generic versions of these functions requires the API to return JSON. Currently it says there \"is no need\" to use it for string types which implies it might still work when it doesn't.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33972","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpClient generic methods should expect text responseType when generic type is number/string/boolean\" (#33972)"},{"Id":"526813455","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T20:05:29","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"33971","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy):track changes across failed builds","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

A week is defined as a period of exactly 7 days (according to Wikipedia), and according to ISO 8601, the first week of a year is the week containing the first Thursday of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy these rules, 2019 has 52 weeks, and 2020 has 53 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.g. the first week of 2020 is the week from 30th of December to the 5th of January. \r\nThe Date pipe returns the period from December 29th to December 31st as week 53, and January 1st of 2020 as week 1. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe date parsing has an extra week in 2019, which has 3 days, which seems like unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://angular-issue-repro2-ycvycu.stackblitz.io\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{{ '2019-12-29T00:00:00' | date:'w' }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33961","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The Date pipe returns incorrect week numbers\" (#33961)"},{"Id":"526616447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T14:06:22","Actor":"devversion","Number":"33960","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update injectable migration guide to reflect latest schematic changes","State":"open","Body":"Since we created the migration guide for the `missing-injectable` schematic, the schematic\r\nchanged in various ways. e.g. the migration no longer migrates classes passed to `useExisting`\r\n\r\nAdditionally the migration has been expanded to handle another Ivy breaking change where\r\nproviders like `{provide: X}` will be intepreted as `{provide: X, useClass: X}`.

7\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe are using a custom typescript transformer which is replacing provider tokens in component decorators to enable custom implementations of services depending on the build configuration.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'booking-editor',\r\n    template: '...',\r\n    providers: [\r\n        BookingUiService\r\n    ]\r\n})\r\nexport class BookingEditorComponent {\r\n  constrcutor(uiService: BookingUiService){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will be transformed to the following:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'booking-editor',\r\n    template: '...',\r\n    providers: [\r\n      { provide: BookingUiService, useClass: CustomBookingUiService }\r\n    ]\r\n})\r\nexport class BookingEditorComponent {\r\n  constrcutor(uiService: BookingUiService){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis custom transformer we add to the beginning of `_transformers` array of the `AngularCompilerPlugin`.\r\n\r\nUntil the upgrade from Angular 7 to Angular 8, this worked like a charm but now on runtime, the custom implementation is not present, both JIT and AOT.\r\n\r\nIf i dump the modified `ts.SourceFile`, i can see the applied change as well as another already applied change, the `importFactory` transformer adds `export { ɵ0 };` to the sourceFile, even if i add the custom transformer to the beginning of the `_transformers` list?\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___ \r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n

doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMaybe somebody already asked this but are there any plans in terms of extensibility of CLI build tasks? \r\n\r\n\r\n1. I understand right now the recomended way to extend cli is to write schematics to create some custom generate command. Or even override existing ones like some of the cli are doing it.\r\n2. You are also able to use `builder API` to really change behavior or create new for the existing commands (build, serve, test,..)\r\n3. if I want to extends existing build process, then I can extends `browser build` `export default createBuilder` where I can call existinb fn `buildWebpackBrowser as executeBrowserBuilder`, and then do some my own logic\r\n\r\n- But what I am strugling with or I dont see a solution, how do I easily extend and alter building process of existing application that might already be using some builder API. \r\n\r\nCurrent solution does not scale, as you can extend `builder API` and replace application's configuration for your builder, but this would not work if they are already using some custom builder API. So replace is not really an option. \r\n\r\nWhat you need some Injection points, to be able to register your tasks before, after each task. I know ngx-build-plus is trying to do something similar, but again if we use ngx-build-plus and project has already some builder it will not work. \r\n\r\nLike Maven, Gradle,....\r\n\r\nAny pointers ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16247","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for CLI extension\" (#16247)"},{"Id":"526476681","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T09:44:03","Actor":"ssmartin","Number":"16246","RawContent":null,"Title":"File / class deleted during tree shake despite the fact is being used","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: .Angular 7\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a service / configuration  that we provide dynamically based on decorator. \r\n\r\nLooks like this: \r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\n@Configuration({ deps: [] })\r\nexport class VehiclePickerConfiguration extends NewPickerConfiguration {\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super(VEHICLE_CONFIG);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically we register (add to a static map) this configuration / service metadata (and many others) by using our custom annotation / decorator. Later on, this configuration / service is provided on the fly using the following code: \r\n\r\n```\r\n injectorProviders = injectorProviders.concat({ provide: metaData.constructor, useClass: metaData.constructor, deps: metaData.deps });\r\n        this.createInjector(injectorProviders);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen this VehicleConfigurationis is requested / used in two other different files / classes like this: \r\n\r\n`let configuration: VehiclePickerConfiguration = this.getPickerConfiguration<VehiclePickerConfiguration>(FieldContainers.RentContract.RentContract_booking_vehiclePriceList_vehicle); \r\n`\r\n\r\nLong story short, we have some generic code to provide these services / configurations on the fly and this worked very well until Angular 8. \r\nBut since Angular 8 the whole file (_vehicle.configuration_) where this configuration is written is basically tree shake (deleted) during compile time and this gives us extra headaches and causing bus in our application. \r\n\r\nIF i provide this _VehicleConfiguration_ manually anywhere in the app then the file is not deleted anymore, but this in our case defeats the purpose of providing and creating the instances of these services ONLY when they are needed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThe file is deleted most probably during the tree shake process even if it's used (imported and referenced in two other files / classess) and due to this we will have unexpected results (the vehicle configuration is not created and we get and undefined exception)\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.17\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.13\r\n...

This silently breaks the logic.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when using `ng build`; it doesn't happen with `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse `ng new` to create a minimal project.\r\n\r\nAdd the following to `app.component.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  sum = 0;\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    const numSet = new Set([12, 13, 17]);\r\n    for (const num of numSet) {\r\n      this.sum += num;\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(this.sum);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `tsconfig.json`, make just one change:\r\n```\r\n\"target\": \"es2016\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `ng build` (not in prod mode).\r\n\r\nHere's the compiled `main-es2016.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar AppComponent = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n  function AppComponent() {\r\n    this.sum = 0;\r\n    var numSet = new Set([12, 13, 17]);\r\n    for (var _i = 0, numSet_1 = numSet; _i < numSet_1.length; _i++) {\r\n      var num = numSet_1[_i];\r\n      this.sum += num;\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(this.sum);\r\n  }\r\n  return AppComponent;\r\n}());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n`this.sum` should evaluate to 42; instead it evaluates to zero.\r\nThis happens because `numSet_1.length` is undefined. For the Set object, the compiler should have used the `.size` property, not `.length`.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.19\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.19\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.19\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.19\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.19\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.19\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.19\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThere are plenty of ways to work around this bug, but it's insidious so it really should be fixed.\r\n\r\nI can't replicate this in Typescript (with `tsc` alone), so I assume the problem is in Angular, not in Typescript.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16229","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Iteration over Set object with ES2016 is broken, because Set doesn't have length property\" (#16229)"},{"Id":"525342780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-20T16:38:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"16232","RawContent":null,"Title":"Several 8.3.x differential loading fixes","State":"closed","Body":"Ensures that iteration is properly down leveled and allows proper differential loading processing when tsconfig target is greater than ES2015.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16232","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Several 8.3.x differential loading fixes\" (#16232)"},{"Id":"525349305","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-20T16:37:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"16234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Backport update/add package install fixes to 8.3.x","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16234","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Backport update/add package install fixes to 8.3.x\" (#16234)"},{"Id":"525910894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-20T15:30:04","Actor":"KissBalazs","Number":"16241","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng <command> --help does not work","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/cli\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nnot sure. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAngular cli commands seems to be working, but the --help flag does not work in them in angular 8.

We should probably have used a different variable name.\r\nLet's assume we had a bug caused by shadowing.\r\nNow we want to make sure that never happens again, so we want the build to fail if we ever rely on shadowing anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo we put in tslint.json under rules:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"no-shadowed-variable\": {\"severity\": \"error\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut damn it:\r\nOur IDE still shows it as a warning:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2378665/69176436-0207db00-0b06-11ea-8cc4-0eb7d439e684.png)\r\naha, the vscode team messed up: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin/issues/122\r\nso we configure in settings json \"tslint.alwaysShowRuleFailuresAsWarnings\": false\r\n\r\nF*** now everything is an error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2378665/69176505-1e0b7c80-0b06-11ea-927d-20fcf80f030f.png)\r\n\r\nAha, the angular team messed up: The didn't put any \"defaultSeverity\" in ./tslint.json so let's do that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"defaultSeverity\": \"warning\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the IDE (because we live in the fantastic time where some changes have immediate effect and some require a restart and no one know which require a restart...) it behaves properly\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2378665/69176641-6460db80-0b06-11ea-99d2-bb71ef71704b.png)\r\nNow lets see the CLI:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntslint --project . --quiet\r\n```\r\nproperly reports only the ERRORs\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2378665/69176711-8b1f1200-0b06-11ea-96cc-6fcc69788a72.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng lint\r\n```\r\ndetects the error, but happily reports that \"All files pass linting.\". **Clearly a BUG.**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2378665/69176820-bc97dd80-0b06-11ea-8e33-d1bf75f99cc7.png)\r\n\r\nng serve succeeds - **arguably it should treat linting errors just as much as errors as typechecking errors!**\r\n\r\n**ng build succeeds - yay, \"errors\" in tslint.json officially means nothing to angular :(**\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAll files pass linting.\r\n</code></pre>\r\nWhen there is  a linting ERROR.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.19\r\nNode: 11.13.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.3.19\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.3.19\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.3.19\r\n@angular/flex-layout               8.0.0-beta.27\r\n@angular/material                  8.2.3\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   8.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.3.19\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.19\r\n@schematics/update                 0.803.19\r\nrxjs                               6.5.2\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nRelated Issues:\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin/issues/122\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9750\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10013\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7185\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16231","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng lint succeeds when tslint fails, and other default linting misconfiguration (vscode)\" (#16231)"},{"Id":"525188018","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-19T18:34:31","Actor":"Mark0liveira","Number":"16230","RawContent":null,"Title":" Ng error serves","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

There are two tabs. Select \"**tab-2**\". Move around the red proxy/div and set it somewhere different than 0, 0.\r\n\r\n2. Move to \"**tab-1**\". This is a blank-tab but it's enough to reproduce the bug. Now, resize your chrome window (1 pixel is enough).\r\n\r\n3. Move back to \"**tab-2**\" and ... boom! the red proxy/div **has been reset to position 0, 0**!\r\n\r\nThis actually makes cdkDragBoundary unusable for us since we have a very flexible and rich layout system.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\nI was expecting the cdkDrag + cdkDragBoundary to exactly work as if \"**tab-2**\" was always visible: **maintaining the red proxy at its dragged position** (translate3d) **or modify it depending on the available container size**.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\nAs stated before, the dragged red proxy gets its position reset after a chrome window resize if boundary container is \"invisible\". \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.14\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): 78.0.3904.97\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10 Enterprise 1809\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17750","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDragBoundary is resetting positions of draggable elements when boundary is invisible\" (#17750)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-11-22T05:30:05.4589524Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2793}

To deal with this, instead we have to create a signal, then a subscription to the Observable that updates the signal, then teardown that subscription on component destruction. That's some plumbing that can be hidden and reused instead.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new Signal type that has an `observe` function on it that accepts an Observable and that automatically subscribes and tears down the subscription when the signal is destroyed.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManual Observable subscribe,  signal update, unsubscribe.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Rxjs adapter signal that can be late-subscribed\" (#58055)"},{"Id":"2559236888","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T18:01:33","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"58030","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): cleanup `AfterRenderSequence` for reference list","State":"closed","Body":"In this commit, we're replacing the provided injector in `afterNextRender` with a node injector because it was previously mistakenly passing an `EnvironmentInjector`.

I've noticed this on several pages, though most recently on the FormGroup page. Likewise, clicking on one of the sidebar cards does not always highlight the correct item in the api. The offset seems to be fairly consistent per problematic page, though not all pages may have the same offset (i.e. clicking a property may pull up a doc for an item two down instead. This +2 offset will stay the same on that page, but another page may have a +1 offset). This may be related to properties that are not supposed to be publicly exposed (such as those starting with theta on the FormGroup page, which do not appear in the sidebar cards), but I can't say this definitively.\n\nIt seems that when a property is clicked and the card is brought up, the route registered in the browser correctly corresponds with the revealed card, but not with the actual property click. For example, if I click `readonly override valueChanges: Observable<TValue>;`, the route registered in the browser is instead `https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup#setValidators`, and indeed, the setValidators card appears.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No

Applications logs this specific events:\r\nFoo component creation, Foo component destruction, Every call to `shouldReuseRoute` with returned value.\r\n\r\nIn some cases router destroys FooComponent despite shouldReuseRoute returns true and in never recreates them back.\r\nTo replicate this specific error please launch attached application from repository and navigate to http://localhost:4200/Foo. \r\n\r\nWhen you start your application this way and navigate through the /Foo router subtree everything is working as expected, route is reused there is only one Foo Created in console.\r\nWhen you navigate to Abc route Foo is destroyed since it is not supposed to be reused which is expected at this time.\r\nAfter navigating to Abc when you navigate back to Foo/Bar/Baz component is recreated which is expected.\r\nThen if you navigate to /Foo the problem manifests.\r\nAngular calls RouteReuseStrategy to check if it should reuse route, strategy returns true. **Despite that** angular destroys FooComponent and never creates new instance of FooComponent.\r\n\r\nSo the replication goes like that:\r\n1. Start the app, run browser on http://localhost:4200/Foo\r\n2. Navigate to Abc route through link\r\n3. Navigate to either Bar or Bar/Baz links through link\r\n4. Navigate to Root link by url\r\n\r\nCuriously when you skip point 3. app works normally.\r\nWhen you start the app from url http://localhost:4200/Abc and go through the steps 3 - 4 it can be reproduced also.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is connected to this issue or I should issue another ticket, but there seems to be a problem with `activatedRoute.data` emissions in attached project.\r\n`FooComponent` is displaying activatedRoute.data in its body. \r\n\r\nIf you start the application from url `http://localhost:4200/Foo/Bar/Baz` it shows `{ \"path\": \"/Foo/Bar/Baz\" }` but if you start the app form url `http://localhost:4200/Foo` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/Foo/Bar/Baz` by link it shows `{ \"path\": \"/Foo/Bar - root\" }`. It is inconsistent and seems buggy. I am not sure if it supposed to work that way.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/MateuszBogdan/angular-router-bug\n\n### Please provide the

potential memory leaks","State":"open","Body":"According to the promise specification, promises are not cancellable by default. Once a promise is created, it will either resolve or reject, and it doesn't provide a built-in mechanism to cancel it.\r\nThere may be situations where a promise is provided, and it either resolves after the pipe has been destroyed or never resolves at all. If the promise never resolves — potentially due to factors beyond our control, such as third-party libraries — this can lead to a memory leak.\r\nWhen we use `async.then(updateLatestValue)`, the engine captures a reference to the `updateLatestValue` function. This allows the promise to invoke that function when it resolves. When we use `from(async)`, we're essentially inverting the dependency. In this case, `updateLatestValue` is passed as a callback to be invoked whenever the observable emits a value.\r\nThe internal `from` mechanism checks whether `subscriber.closed` is falsy before calling `subscriber.next()` when the promise resolves. Therefore, if the promise resolves after the strategy has been disposed of, nothing will happen.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58041","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(common): wrap promise in `from()` to prevent potential memory leaks\" (#58041)"},{"Id":"2560248357","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T21:30:17","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"58040","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): allow playground component to be cleaned up properly","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we're replacing the `async-await` style in the playground component with the `from()`\r\nobservable, which allows us to invert a dependency and avoid memory leaks.

One app is the Identity App and we need to run this and one of the other apps which provide features. I start up the Identity App first and then run the Feature App.\r\n\r\nEach time I run ng serve for the Identity App I get a folder in .angular\\cache\\18.2.5\\vite which is named deps_temp_#hash where the hash is different each time. If I run this with a completely empty cache folder every time I run ng serve I get another folder created.\r\n\r\nI then run ng serve for the Feature App and I get a similar folder but it quickly disappears and I get a deps folder but all of the temp folders for the Identity App remain.\r\n\r\nTypically on first run I now get an error in the Network tab of Chrome DevTools with 504 error always on a file called `browser-#hash.js?v=#hash`. Upon rerunning ng serve the problem can go away and sometimes it's very difficult to replicate again and then other times it happens all the time. The browser file is requested from disk from the vite cache and it never exists within the cache itself.\r\n\r\nObviously the app is rendered useless when it does happen.\r\n\r\nI understand without a repo that replicates this its going to be very difficult to diagnose however I was hoping that somebody with a little more knowledge than myself of this tooling process could provide some guidance as we have come to a full-stop on it other than disabling the cache or just living with the problem.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nUnfortunately I haven't as yet managed to replicate the problem in an example setup outside of our live application. The application uses Duende Identity server and ASP.NET Core minimal API projects along with multiple SQL databases etc. so its not an easy thing to replicate in its entirety.\n\n### Exception or

This allowed for custom control during SSR scenarios.\r\nHowever, as per the Angular documentation:\r\n\r\n> Note: In Angular v17 and later, server.ts is no longer used by ng serve. The dev server will use main.server.ts directly to perform server-side rendering.\r\n\r\nThis change has introduced a regression where it's no longer possible to pass these objects to the SSR process when using the development server.\r\n\r\nHere is the example our project used. \r\n\r\n### tokens.ts \r\n```\r\nconst CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<AppContext>('EXAMPLE_TOKEN');\r\n\r\nexport class BrowserContext extends AppContext { ... } \r\nexport class ExpressContext extends AppContext { ... } \r\n```\r\n\r\n### server.ts \r\n```\r\nimport { CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN } from './tokens';\r\nimport bootstrap from './src/main.server';\r\n\r\nfunction app() {\r\n     const server = express();\r\n     const engine = new CommonEngine();\r\n     ...\r\n     server.get('*', (req, res) => {\r\n        const expressContext = new ExpressContext(req, res);\r\n\r\n        engine.render({\r\n            bootstrap,\r\n            providers: [\r\n                 { provide: CUSTOM_INJECTION_TOKEN, useValue: expressContext }\r\n            ],\r\n        });\r\n     });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using ng serve in Angular v17+, the Vite dev server only looks at main.server.ts. As a result, even if we inject providers into server.ts, there's no way to pass the request/response objects to the SSR process.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe should have a way to pass request/response objects to the SSR process when using the development server, similar to how it was possible in versions prior to Angular v17. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28535","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[dev-server] Unable to pass custom providers for SSR in Angular v17+\"

In other words, there should be no difference in the final result compared to when `cdk/drag-drop` did not use popoper under the hood for the preview.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe element is centered vertically between top and bottom (if you do not consider the transform).\r\n\r\nThe combination of CSS below results in this particular issue (only properties included that really lead to this particular behavior):\r\n```css\r\nelement.style {\r\n    position: fixed !important;\r\n    top: 0px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-box {\r\n    align-self: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* user agent stylesheet */\r\n[popover] { \r\n    inset: 0px;\r\n}\r\n``` \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.0-next.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.0-next.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29809","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdk/drag-drop): Improper positioning of drag preview since it uses native popover (v17.3.6 and above)\" (#29809)"},{"Id":"2561042091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T15:27:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29813","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/drag-drop): positioning thrown off with align-self","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the combination of setting `align-self: center` and the user agent styling of `inset: 0` on popovers was breaking the positioning of the preview.\r\n\r\nFixes #29809.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29813","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/drag-drop): positioning thrown off with align-self\" (#29813)"},{"Id":"2554734853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T09:12:19","Actor":"yakovmeister","Number":"29801","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content","State":"closed","Body":"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content\r\n\r\nSeems like the condition for setting the `advancedMarker.content` is redundant here:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9011f50-afda-4569-8571-06ec49a6e12b)\r\nI think it's safe to remove the first condition.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29801","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content\" (#29801)"},{"Id":"2560285711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T22:01:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29812","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): remove visually hidden styles from core","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29812","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): remove visually hidden styles from core\" (#29812)"},{"Id":"2559812472","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T17:28:28","Actor":"vejandla","Number":"29810","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-from-field): Remove the border for the input.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n7.0\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwith angular material 7.0, mat-form-field used to have `appearance=\"none\"` option, which would remove the border.

Example usage:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Pick a time</mat-label>\r\n  <input matInput [matTimepicker]=\"picker\"/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker #picker/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker-toggle [for]=\"picker\"/>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeatures of the new component include:\r\n* Automatically parses the typed-in value to a date object using the current `DateAdapter`. Existing date adapters have been updated to add support for parsing times.\r\n* Time values can be generated either using the `interval` input (e.g. `interval=\"45min\"`) or provided directly through the `options` input.\r\n* Integrated into `@angular/forms` by providing itself as a `ControlValueAccessor` and `Validator`.\r\n* Offers built-in validation for minimum, maximum and time formatting.\r\n* Offers keyboard navigation support.\r\n* Accessibility implemented using the combobox + listbox pattern.\r\n* Can be used either with `mat-form-field` or on its own.\r\n* Can be combined with `mat-datepicker` (docs to follow, see the dev app for now).\r\n* Includes test harnesses for all directives.\r\n* Works with Material's theming system.\r\n* Can be configured globally through an injection token.\r\n* Can be used either as an `NgModule` or by importing the standalone directives.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why did it take so long?\r\nOne of the main reasons why we hadn't provided a timepicker component until now was that there's no \r\nuniversally-accepted design for what a timepicker should look like.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn't Material Design have a timepicker?\r\nMaterial Design has had a [specification for a timepicker](https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview) for years, but we didn't want to implement it because:\r\n1. This design is primarily geared towards mobile users on Android. It would look out of place in the desktop-focused enterprise UIs that a lot of Angular developers build.\r\n2. The time dial UI is complicated and can be overwhelming, especially in the 24h variant.\r\n3. The accessibility pattern is unclear, users may have to fall back to using the inputs.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. The time dial requires very precise movements if the user wants to select a specific time between others (e.g. 6:52). This can be unusable for users with some disabilities.\r\n6. The non-dial functionality (inputs in a dropdown) don't add much to the user experience.\r\n\r\nThere are [community implementations](https://dhutaryan.github.io/ngx-mat-timepicker) of the dial design that you can install if you want it for your app.\r\n\r\n#### What are some alternate designs that you considered?\r\nSome libraries like [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/timepicker), [Ignite UI](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/time-picker) or [MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/), as well as Chrome's implementation of `<input type=\"time\"/>` appear to have settled on a multi-column design for the dropdown. We didn't want to do something similar because:\r\n1. The selected state is only shown using one sensory characteristic (color) which is problematic for accessibility. While we could either add a second one (e.g. a checkbox) or adjust the design somehow, we felt that this would make it look sub-optimal.\r\n2. The UI only looks good on smaller sizes and when each column has roughly the same amount of text. Changing either for a particular column can throw off the whole UI's appearance.\r\n3. It requires the user to tab through several controls within the dialog.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. Each column requires a lot of filler whitespace in order to be able to align the selected states to each other which can look off on some selections.\r\n\r\n#### Why this design?\r\nWe chose the current design, because:\r\n1. Users are familiar with it, e.g. Google Calendar uses something similar for their time selection.\r\n2. It reuses the design from existing Material Design components.\r\n3. It uses an established accessibility pattern (combobox + listbox) and it doesn't have the same concerns as the multi-column design around indicating the selected state.\r\n4. It allows us to support a wide range of locales.\r\n5. It's compact, allowing us to do some sort of unified control with `mat-datepicker` in the future.\r\n\r\nFixes #5648.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29806","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/timepicker): add timepicker component\" (#29806)"},{"Id":"2558306828","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T06:30:21","Actor":"marcingryczon","Number":"29805","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-menu): axe a11y report throws aria-expanded not allowed issue","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur axe a11y reports throws issue points to mat-menu aria-expanded as not allowed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 08 21 04\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdc66e0b-d726-4df3-9b80-4fe3a4cde112\">\r\n\r\nIs there any way to use this component without aria-expanded?

This caused an issue with Angular DevTools users who use third party scripts that:\r\n1. creates an iframe\r\n2. uses the iframes document to create a DOM element\r\n3. injects that DOM element into the main document\r\n\r\nThis commit attempts to resolve this issue by augmenting assertDomNode to account for the case where a DomNode comes from another frame. Unfortunately there is no definitive way of doing this without having access to the frame in question, so we instead use a mostly accurate heuristic.\r\n\r\nSee #47357 for more context and a minimal reproduction of the issue.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47401","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): update assertDomNode to catch the case where a node comes from another frame\" (#47401)"},{"Id":"1368957886","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-11T14:10:04","Actor":"rawatdev","Number":"47400","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix angle brackets in details code block","State":"open","Body":"Angle brackets are not showing inside the markdown code block by writing like &lt; &gt;.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It finally allows fully CD aware dynamic inputs changing.\r\nCurrently if I want to extend a component with a directive and set inputs from it I need to do one of the two options:\r\n1. Change the inputs statically in the constructor\r\n2. Change inputs to get/set as `ngOnChanges` won't fire\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllowing to inject `ComponentRef` of the host component instead of the actual instance. This way we could just use `setInput` to update inputs and have a full CD aware binding support not through the template.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Change the inputs statically in the constructor only - Can't apply to directive input based changes or observable based changes\r\n2. Change inputs to get/set - Possible but annoying and \"leaks\" the knowledge of this component is being used from a directive outside. How can one explain why `ngOnChanges` was not used...\r\n3. Maybe not through `ComponentRef` but as any other way to use `setInput` from DI injected components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow injecting ComponentRef of a component through DI \" (#47398)"},{"Id":"1368401025","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-09T23:06:46","Actor":"bchanudet","Number":"47397","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: replace deprecated --outFile option for ng extract-i18n","State":"open","Body":"replace deprecated --outFile option for ng extract-i18n\r\n\r\nThe `--outFile` command option was last used in Angular v10 (back when it was still `ng xi18n`), yet there are still references to it in the documentation, alongside the up-to-date option `--out-file`.

This is causing 508 compliance issues for accessibility.  There is no way we've found via css or otherwise to access the button to either give it text or value.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Place a nav mat-tab-nav-bar component with items on a page.\r\n2.  Examine page in browser with a tool that evaluates accessibility - ie 'WAVE Evaluation Tool' extention for Chrome\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWe should be able to access the button to either give it value text or have a way so if its disable to not even render it on that screen.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe button is present and we are unable to access it through any available methods or properties to give it a value or text  or hide it.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Tab bar nav): 508 Compliance Issue\" (#25604)"},{"Id":"1366236376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-08T12:37:18","Actor":"devversion","Number":"25602","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: re-enable until front of line blocking in publish snapshot job","State":"open","Body":"We had to temporarily disable the CircleCI orb command that helps ensuring snapshot jobs\r\ndo not conflict when running concurrently.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the CircleCI API has been fixed to no longer cause issues with the Orb.

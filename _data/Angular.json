These two modifiers aren't necessary and I guess they should only belong to the child component in this case. Although strickly speaking, in this case, the root component's injector will not change the result in child component. However, the real injector's value in root component should be 'null', instead of ü¶î . I think 'changing the value to null' or 'removing the `@SkipSelf` and `@Host` modifiers' both works.\r\n\r\n(2) The child component's injector value should be ü¶î, instead of üê∂. I think this also fits the conclusion of the document and the real test result.\r\n\r\nSo below is the expecting fix of current representation:\r\n![screenshot-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11903242/90288223-6c586c80-de47-11ea-8e05-34e5e5379861.png)\r\n\r\nI think logical tree representation is a good idea to represent the details of the injection process. I met the issue to understand the value in this one and I tested the value following the project structure to verify, so I guess this is an editing error.\r\n\r\nIf I have some misunderstandings for the document, looking forward to your correction. \r\n\r\nThank you for your work and the constantly update!\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#host-and-viewproviders\r\n\r\n## üì∑Screenshot\r\n![screenshot-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11903242/90287100-2c908580-de45-11ea-80d3-090ffbcd87e3.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11903242/90288223-6c586c80-de47-11ea-8e05-34e5e5379861.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11903242/90287522-07e8dd80-de46-11ea-8aaf-7b4338e28cb0.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38471","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mistake in [Hierarchical Injection] \"@Host and viewProviders\" section's logical tree representation\"\" (#38471)"},{"Id":"679367116","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-14T19:45:03","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"38470","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update yargs and typings for yargs","State":"open","Body":"Updating yargs and typings for the updated yargs module.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates yargs usage for `dev-infra`, `localize` and `ngcc`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38470","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update yargs and typings for yargs\" (#38470)"},{"Id":"679309482","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-14T18:41:38","Actor":"atscott","Number":"38468","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): Allow scrolling when browser supports scrollTo","State":"closed","Body":"This commit fixes a regression from \"fix(common): ensure\r\nscrollRestoration is writable (#30630)\" that caused scrolling to not\r\nhappen at all in browsers that do not support scroll restoration.

It is applicable to all Angular versions.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe problem arises in the template driven form (with NgModel) when you change the name attribute of the control in the DOM. If one has, say, 4 `<input>` fields in an ngFor loop with their own values and name attributes that correspond to the array‚Äôs indexes, and removes whichever `<input>` field but the last one, and then adds a new `<input>` field, the default value of the newly-added field replaces the value of the third `<input>` field. That is, the DOM element‚Äôs value is affected by the value of the newly-added field, whereas the values of the array elements behind the DOM elements are not. \r\n\r\nThe problem has to do with the FormControls in the FormGroup, related to the rendered DOM elements, and the naming convention for FormControls of using indexes. Removing an `<input>` DOM element does not change the names of the rest underlying FormControls within the FormGroup even if the name attribute of the control has been changed. It just reorganises the indexes of the DOM elements after the removed field. Thus, when a new `<input>` element is added after the removal of an element, its FormControl‚Äôs name is created with index 3, which is already used in the name of the FormControl for the second last element, and the new FormControl eventually points to the two last `<input>` DOM elements at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we want to lay down the following two considerations. First, what is the reason for the NgModel not to follow the changes in the names of DOM elements and not to update FormControls in the FormGroup? Second, we know that trackBy solves our problem, as suggested in a number of posts online such as [this one](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/21068#issuecomment-352882911), but we believe that this is a workaround and the real issue is circumvented. That is why we would like to propose another solution with the following patch:\r\n```\r\n--- old_ng_model.js\t2020-08-13 11:12:38.000000000 +0300\r\n+++ ng_model.js\t2020-08-13 11:03:54.000000000 +0300\r\n@@ -151,6 +151,15 @@\r\n         this._checkForErrors();\r\n         if (!this._registered)\r\n             this._setUpControl();\r\n+        if (this._registered && 'name' in changes && changes.name['previousValue']){\r\n+            resolvedPromise.then(() => {\r\n+                let currControl = Object.assign(new NgModel, this);\r\n+                currControl.name = changes.name['previousValue'];\r\n+                return this.formDirective.removeControl(currControl);\r\n+            }).then(() => {\r\n+                this._setUpControl();\r\n+            });\r\n+        }\r\n         if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\r\n             this._updateDisabled(changes);\r\n         }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere‚Äôs the code for the minimal reproduction of the problem: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-p8fd6d?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\n##### Steps to Exemplify the Problem:\r\nadd four new elements.

Instead we started only\r\nbuilding ES2015 output and then downleveled it to ES5 UMD for the NPM packages. This worked\r\nas expected but unveiled an issue in the `@angular/core` reflection capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn JIT mode, Angular determines constructor parameters (for DI) using the `ReflectionCapabilities`. The\r\nreflection capabilities basically read runtime metadata of classes to determine the DI parameters. Such\r\nmetadata can be either stored in static class properties like `ctorParameters` or within TypeScript's `design:params`.\r\n\r\nIf Angular comes across a class that does not have any parameter metadata, it tries to detect if the\r\ngiven class is actually delegating to an inherited class. It does this naively in JIT by checking if the\r\nstringified class (function in ES5) matches a certain pattern. e.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MatTable() {\r\n  var _this = _super.apply(this, arguments) || this;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese patterns are reluctant to changes of the class output. If a class is not recognized properly, the\r\nDI parameters will be assumed empty and the class is **incorrectly** constructed without arguments.\r\n\r\nThis actually happened as part of v10 now. Since we downlevel ES2015 to ES5 (instead of previously\r\ncompiling sources directly to ES5), the class output changed slightly so that Angular no longer detects\r\nit. e.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar _this = _super.apply(this, __spread(arguments)) || this;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because the ES2015 output will receive an auto-generated constructor if the class\r\ndefines class properties. This constructor is then already containing an explicit `super` call.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport class MatTable extends CdkTable {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super(...arguments);\r\n        this.disabled = true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we then downlevel this file to ES5 with `--downlevelIteration`, TypeScript adjusts the `super` call so that\r\nthe spread operator is no longer used (not supported in ES5). The resulting super call is different to the\r\nsuper call that would have been emitted if we would directly transpile to ES5. Ultimately, Angular no\r\nlonger detects such classes as having an delegate constructor -> and DI breaks.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/angular/ggbbllnexbk?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-basic-example.ts\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nErrors vary; usually it's an error about accessing a property of `undefined`. Where `undefined`\r\nis supposed to be an injected token (like `ElementRef` or `NgZone`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'nativeElement' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional notes:\r\n\r\n* This also surfaces in ng-packagr v10.\r\n* This might also affect ngcc. cc. @JoostK for more concrete details here.\r\n\r\n## Potential solutions\r\n\r\n1. Changing the reflection capabilities and ngcc to handle the other class output\r\n2. Not using downleveling but directly transpiling sources to ES5.\r\n3. Disabling the `--downlevelIteration` flag when downleveling.\r\n\r\nFYI: There were attempts in the past to fix this: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22642. it looks\r\nlike the issue didn't surface anymore at some point because we switched from downleveling (which we\r\ndid in the past at some point) to transpiling sources directly to ES5.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dependency injection not working in JIT due to unrecognized delegate constructors in downleveled ES5 output\" (#38453)"},{"Id":"678731451","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-13T21:01:02","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"38452","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n translation parser fixes","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, the dependency spec for `rxjs` for some Angular dependencies is exact (`6.5.4`) for at least:\r\n\r\n  * `@angular-devkit/architect`\r\n  * `@angular-devkit/build-webpack`\r\n  * `@angular-devkit/core`\r\n  * `@angular-devkit/schematics`\r\n  * `@ngtools/webpack`\r\n  * `@schematics/update`\r\n\r\nThis results in a situation where, due to NPM's conservation de-duplication, many copies of `rxjs` are installed into the `node_modules`. This is illustrated below:\r\n \r\n```\r\n$ ng --version\r\n...\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.12\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n...\r\n$ ng new --routing false --style css new-app\r\n...\r\n‚úî Packages installed successfully.\r\n...\r\n$ pushd new-app\r\n...\r\n$ npm ls rxjs\r\nnew-app@0.0.0 ...\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/architect@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/build-webpack@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/core@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @ngtools/webpack@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular/cli@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/schematics@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @schematics/update@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4 \r\n‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚î¨ inquirer@7.1.0\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.5  deduped\r\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.5\r\n$ find node_modules -name rxjs -type d | xargs du -sh\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@angular-devkit/core/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@angular-devkit/build-webpack/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@schematics/update/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/@ngtools/webpack/node_modules/rxjs\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/rxjs\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nChange the `rxjs` dependency spec from `6.x.y` to `~6.x.y` in:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/architect/package.json\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_webpack/package.json\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/core/package.json\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/package.json\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/ngtools/webpack/package.json\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/update/package.json\r\n\r\netc\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nChanging the dependency spec in the apps's`package.json` to an exact version (eg `6.5.4` in for `9.1.12`) allows the deduplication, but has the downside of not allowing `rxjs` to be upgraded with bugfixes etc:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm ls rxjs\r\nnew-app@0.0.0 ...\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/architect@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/build-webpack@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/core@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @ngtools/webpack@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular/cli@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @angular-devkit/schematics@9.1.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ @schematics/update@0.901.12\r\n‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚î¨ inquirer@7.1.0\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4  deduped\r\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rxjs@6.5.4\r\n$ find node_modules -name rxjs -type d | xargs du -sh\r\n 17M\tnode_modules/rxjs\r\n...\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18536","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider moving rxjs to patch version specification to allow significant deduplication in node_modules\" (#18536)"},{"Id":"679427918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-14T22:13:52","Actor":"clydin","Number":"18535","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): replace experimental workspace API with stable API","State":"open","Body":"This change removes one of the last usages of the experimental workspace API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18535","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): replace experimental workspace API with stable API\" (#18535)"},{"Id":"679396847","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-14T20:55:09","Actor":"TrevorKarjanis","Number":"18534","RawContent":null,"Title":"The build fails due to missing file after upgrade.","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

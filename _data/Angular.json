That is to say if I edit the HTML file I'm viewing in my browser to add or remove some content and then save the file, nothing changes in my browser. I have not tried `ng build` to see whether it considers HTML/style changes to necessitate rebuilding the app.\r\n\r\nOn to my specific problem! I'm hand-crafting some SVG (excited for `@for`), and I'm editing files with extensions like `.html` and `.scss`, as well as `.ts`. I can reproduce the problem on `app.component.*`, generated via `ng new`. When I edit a TS file, live reload works as expected. If you look at my \"exception or error\" output, you'll see the following series of events:\r\n\r\n1. The initial build, which worked\r\n2. Me editing and saving an HTML file (notice the comment), which did not actually rebuild anything (apparently) or change the content in my browser\r\n3. Me changing an SCSS file, which did the same\r\n4. Subsequent changes to HTML or SCSS files simply do nothing, as you can see. I made several changes such as adding and removing lines to both the HTML and SCSS files and saved them afterwards with no effect.\r\n\r\nI suppose you could argue this is an issue with 3rd party software, not with Angular, but then again, isn't the whole point of Angular to provide a developer-ready framework? I contend that an app created with `ng new` should fully - not partially - support tasks such as editing HTML or SCSS files.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n❯ ng serve\r\n\r\nInitial Chunk Files | Names         |  Raw Size\r\npolyfills.js        | polyfills     |  82.71 kB | \r\nmain.js             | main          |  25.46 kB | \r\nstyles.css          | styles        |  96 bytes | \r\n\r\n                    | Initial Total | 108.26 kB\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation complete.

[`v0.19.11`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01911)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.10...v0.19.11)\n\n-   Fix TypeScript-specific class transform edge case ([#&#8203;3559](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3559))\n\n    The previous release introduced an optimization that avoided transforming `super()` in the class constructor for TypeScript code compiled with `useDefineForClassFields` set to `false` if all class instance fields have no initializers. The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case *and* there are `#private` instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to `super()` (since `super()` is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      public: any;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.#private = 1;\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        this.#private = 1;\n        super();\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: allow reording a primitive past a side-effect ([#&#8203;3568](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3568))\n\n    The minifier previously allowed reordering a side-effect past a primitive, but didn't handle the case of reordering a primitive past a side-effect. This additional case is now handled:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f() {\n      let x = false;\n      let y = x;\n      const boolean = y;\n      let frag = $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${boolean}\">hello world</p>`);\n      return frag;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(){const e=!1;return $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${e}\">hello world</p>`)}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(){return $.template('<p contenteditable=\"false\">hello world</p>')}\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: consider properties named using known `Symbol` instances to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;3561](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3561))\n\n    Many things in JavaScript can have side effects including property accesses and ToString operations, so using a symbol such as `Symbol.iterator` as a computed property name is not obviously side-effect free. This release adds a special case for known `Symbol` instances so that they are considered side-effect free when used as property names. For example, this class declaration will now be considered side-effect free:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Provide the `stop()` API in node to exit esbuild's child process ([#&#8203;3558](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3558))\n\n    You can now call `stop()` in esbuild's node API to exit esbuild's child process to reclaim the resources used. It only makes sense to do this for a long-lived node process when you know you will no longer be making any more esbuild API calls. It is not necessary to call this to allow node to exit, and it's advantageous to not call this in between calls to esbuild's API as sharing a single long-lived esbuild child process is more efficient than re-creating a new esbuild child process for every API call. This API call used to exist but was removed in [version 0.9.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.9.0). This release adds it back due to a user request.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.69.7`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1697)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.69.6...1.69.7)\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   In the JS Embedded Host, properly install the x64 Dart Sass executable on\n    ARM64 Windows.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Each domain should have its own theme configuration fetched from a database on the server.\r\n\r\n**Approaches Tried**: I attempted to access the hostname using methods such as `@Inject(DOCUMENT)` for the **Document** and **PlatformLocation**, but these only work on the client side.\r\n\r\n**Server-side Code**: In the server-side code (server.ts), I added Injection Tokens within the Angular SSR's commonEngine.render() method to provide request-related data, but the retrieved data remains NULL in the component.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular SSR application with Firebase Hosting connected to multiple domains. (Although it is not required*)\r\n\r\nIn the app component page use HttpClient to get a domain theme (or any info)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private linkService: LinkService,\r\n    @Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document,\r\n    // private platformLocation: PlatformLocation,\r\n    @Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object,\r\n  ) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.hostName = this.document.location.hostname;\r\n    this.linkService.executeGETHTTPQuery('LOAD_LINK_PROFILE_DATA', {link_id: this.hostName})\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen build or server the application\r\n`\"serve:ssr\": \"npm run build:dev && node dist/{APP_NAME}/server/server.mjs\",`\r\n\r\nTry to run `curl {host}` it's a blank page which means there was not any SSR process to generate HTML content.\r\nIn the case of my other application with a static hostname, it returns me a full HTML codebase.\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nI expected to retrieve the hostname or domain information during server-side rendering, allowing me to dynamically fetch the specific theme configurations based on the individual domains.\n```\n\n\n### Your

As of version 15, that is no longer happening.  If the user tabs before the typeaheadDebounceInterval has elapsed, the mat-select is left unchanged.  After a recent update to our application which upgraded Angular to version 15, this is causing issues with some users who were accustomed to being able to quickly populate a set of mat-selects via keyboard and tab.\r\n\r\nI can workaround this issue on the specific form that is most affected by setting typeaheadDebounceInterval to a much smaller value.  But we have this issue throughout our application.  I'm not sure if it's safe to do that globally in the MatSelectConfig (it will take some time to figure out if that will impact anything in our app).

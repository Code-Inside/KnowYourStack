It's over 9.0.0!*\n\n### What's new\n\nYou can now run package commands directly, no need for `npx` or equivalents.\nIt makes writing hooks more intuitive and is also slightly faster üê∫‚ö°Ô∏è\n\n```diff\n\n### .husky/pre-commit\n- npx jest\n+ jest # ~0.2s faster\n```\n\nA new recipe has been added to the docs.

Just add `export HUSKY=0` to `.config/husky/init.sh`.\n\nI've seen some confusion about this on X, so just a heads-up!\n\n### Sponsoring\n\nHusky is downloaded over 45M times per month and used by ~1.5M projects.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n`FormArray` `.push()` currently only accepts a single `FormControl` or `FormGroup`, manipulating a `FormArray` holding large datasets and using expensive validators is complicated by this behavior, as there is no easy way to refresh the dataset without breaking existing streams depending on its `.valueChanges`.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n`FormArray` `.push()` now accepts both a single `FormControl` or `FormGroup`, but also accepts an array of the same types. In case of an array, it will register all controls as expected and emit a single event after.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nRan into this issue myself working at a client, where we could not easily manipulate a `FormArray` where we want to refresh a large dataset. Swapping it out for a `new FormArray()` seemed like the way, but this broke any existing streams subscribed to its original `.valueChanges`, making it difficult to keep everything in sync and reactive. \r\n\r\nThis solution at least makes it possible to manipulate a dataset within a `FormArray` as a new dataset, instead of having to iterate over all new controls. A possible expansion on this solution, and to promote immutability, could be to offer an additional method that also internally clears the existing dataset so a full replace would be possible.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, managed to run the entire test suite locally, except for `//packages/zone.js/test:karma_jasmine_test_ci_chromium` which seemed to not be able to connect to its ChromeHeadless browser and therefore fail. Hopefully the CI can run this test for me, but I'd still like to know what went wrong exactly.

However, this does not go far enough and fails to account for situations where entire paths are different between server and client. This can happen (such as in my case) when the server is in a Docker network and has direct access to other services and the browser uses a reverse proxy that allows access to the same service through path rewrites based on some known prefixes.\r\n\r\nFor example, `/api/foo` may be routed to an internal service and rewritten as `http://my-service:3000/foo`. Thus, the server needs to call `http://my-service:3000/foo` and the browser needs to call `/api/foo`. The difference between them is more than just the origin.\r\n\r\nThis same issue was mentioned in multiple comments (see below), but the final solutions that introduces `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` is somehow more limiting than the needs that were articulated. See the following comments and several others:\r\n\r\n[#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1792077410)\r\n[#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1832556707)\r\n\r\nScouring the above-mentioned issues and others, I could not find a way to address this use case, which means the transfer cache will never work for my setup.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThere are several possible ways to solve this:\r\n\r\n1. A new token similar to `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` that would allow mapping path prefixes rather than just origins.\r\n2. A way to override the cache key as suggested in #53702, [#50117 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1792077410), [#53702 comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53702#issuecomment-1898089674) and several others.\r\n3. A way to compose the current root interceptor with additional functionality, though this is quite heavy-handed and may lead to unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCurrent alternative is to use `HTTP_TRANSFER_CACHE_ORIGIN_MAP` and change the network setup to accommodate the limitation of only being able to map origins and not paths.

But, I'm facing some runtime issues that I'm not really able to flag as \"internal problems\" or \"angular issues\".  \r\n\r\nSo: either I'm doing something really stupid (then sorry for the waste of time) or there is a bug at angular level. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm mostly inclined to think it's an angular issue related to the usage of \"ng-modules\" / \"zone.js\" and the way esbuild is striping the bundle from unnecessary code as soon as `optimization: true` (default). \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I've created a simple angular project ([myws](https://github.com/mauriziocescon/myws/tree/master)) that you can fork and play with. It's a tiny and simplified version of what we're doing in our CI/CD. \r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the process:  \r\n- build an ng-element (with ng-modules / zone.js) as an application, \r\n- concatenate the resulting files in one main.js, \r\n- load such files at runtime. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the repo, the results are the following: \r\n- mf1 (‚úÖ): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\"`, `\"buildOptimizer\": true`,\r\n- mf2 (‚úÖ): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": false`,\r\n- mf3 (üö´): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": true`.\r\n\r\nwhere mf1 / mf2 / mf3 have basically the same code. \r\n\r\nThe runtime error for mf3 is not really helpful: \r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 22 59\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/006b6a39-ddad-41d3-ad1d-ab5ae8751e66\">\r\n\r\nLocally, I get different errors for different internal mfs, but I assume the root cause is the same.

to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a stylesheet for mapping font icons which looks like:\r\n```scss\r\n:root {\r\n  --icon-menu: \"\\e600\";\r\n  --icon-calendar: \"\\e601\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen serving locally with `optimzation.styles.minify = false` the resulting css looks something like (just like i expected):\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  --icon-menu: \"ÓòÄ\";\r\n  --icon-calendar: \"ÓòÅ\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever if i turn on the style minify optimization (in the prod build or with any other config) the unicode characters will be escaped as documented here https://esbuild.github.io/api/#charset by esbuild when running minify without the charset=utf8\r\n\r\nNow I am asking whether this could be a bug in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/847083698d217a4949d68642fb153d17be8e8e9d/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/plugins/css-optimizer-plugin.ts#L148 where I think this minification process is called or is there another side to that story?\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\ncreate a scss file like:\r\n```scss\r\n:root {\r\n  --icon-menu: \"\\e600\";\r\n  --icon-calendar: \"\\e601\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nset `optimzation.styles.minify = true`\r\nrun `ng build`\r\nlook at the generated output stylesheet -> the unicode characters are escaped but should

Nonetheless, the Angular build still fails, thinking that `id` is still of a nullable type.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  myFunction(): void {\r\n    const objectWithNullableProperty: {id: number | null } = {id: 243};\r\n\r\n    of(objectWithNullableProperty).pipe(\r\n      map(obj => obj.id),\r\n      filter(id => id != null),\r\n      map(id => this.doSomethingWithId(id))\r\n    ).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  doSomethingWithId(id: number): void {\r\n    console.log(id);\r\n  }\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nBuild fails with error:\r\n\r\nTS2345: Argument of type 'number | null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.\r\n  Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number'.\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.1.0\r\nNode: 20.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1801.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build fails on impossible Typescript error with RxJS\" (#28079)"},{"Id":"2417295124","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-18T20:00:42","Actor":"danilobassi8","Number":"28078","RawContent":null,"Title":"Esbuild issue with web workers?","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nHi, I don't know if this is an issue or it should be a feature request. The thing is I'm using web workers in my Angular app, and I have found some issues while deploying it.\r\n\r\nIn my service, I'm importing the web worker as the Angular doc says.\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nthis.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url), \r\n   {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nduring development (`ng serve`) it works as expected. \r\n\r\nBut when I build, I see in my dist folder a new file called `worker-<HASH>`\r\nI'm building with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild using this command:\r\n- `ng build --configuration=production --deploy-url \"https://${CLOUDFRONT_URL}/${VERSION}\"`\r\n\r\nCLOUDFRONT_URL is the URL of my AWS CDN.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is, that I'm not able to locate the file. Because \"import.meta.url\" is not the current URL I'm using for the web page.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n- Lets say that my page is hosted at www.mypage.com\r\n- My files are hosted on a cloudfront cdn, thus, files lives on s3, and I'm able to download it using the CLOUDFRONT_URL mentioned above. (that's why I'm using the --deploy-url param)\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I noted is that, when I do something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n// my typescript code\r\n\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nits gets transpiled to something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('worker-F4AB9Z', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Esbuild replaced the `../utils/workers/myworker.worker` with the compiled filename `worker-F4AB9Z`.\r\nBut it is not doing the same with any string other than \"import.meta.url\" for the URL of the new worker.\r\n\r\nIf I try to do something like\r\n``` typescript\r\nconst url = new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url)\r\n```\r\nI wont work. Esbuild will only replace the file path with the compiled filename if I put the `new URL( ... )` inside the Worker constructor. Is that expected?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.14\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAnother question: Is there any way that I could have the output filename ( the `worker-F4AB9Z` ) in a variable? \r\nBecause currently I'm manually deploying the web worker to s3 and hardcoding the URL in the code.\r\nBut as you may know, the hash of the file changes on every deploy, or at least when the worker code changes.

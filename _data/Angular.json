Especially for devs new to signals (almost everyone at this point), it can be a counter-intuitive problem source to debug.  And there are already issues reported that can be traced to this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51180\r\n\r\nHere's some example code that I wrote that caused non-obvious problems for me:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconstructor() {\r\n  effect(() => {\r\n    this.calendarRef?.setInput('selected', this.range());\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`this.range` is a signal, and `this.calendarRef` is possibly undefined.  I expected any changes to `range` to trigger the effect, but the optional chaining on the `calendarRef` (which was undefined) prevented `range()` from ever being evaluated and thus tracked as a dependency.  And I believe that even if it wasn't undefined for the first run, if it _ever_ reached undefined while the effect was evaluated, the effect would never run again.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n_At the least_, if the first run of a computed() or effect() callback produces no dependencies (invokes no signals), a runtime warning should show in the console to warn the user that their computed signal/effect will not run again.\r\n\r\nIt might also be useful to warn them if their dependency count drops from >1 to 0, which again means the computed signal/effect will not be evaluated again.\r\n\r\nSimilar to `allowSignalWrites`, the dev could remove these training-wheels warnings by positively expressing that they are intentionally designing a callback that will only be called once/stop being updated at some point.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIt would likely be harder to implement, but static code analysis could detect the _possibility_ of a zero-dependency computed signal/effect.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether a warning is added, documentation talking about this pitfall would be useful; currently not present as far as I can tell.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55647","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Computed signals and Effects should produce runtime warning if dependencies reaches zero\" (#55647)"},{"Id":"2276324052","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T20:38:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"55645","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Path port] fix(compiler): add math elements to schema","State":"closed","Body":"**Note:** this is a patch port of the changes from #55631.\r\n\r\nFixes that we didn't have the MathML elements in the schema.

This results in no data for the product prerendered page.\r\n\r\n- Interestingly, **absolute paths do work during SSG**, but they **prevent the use of withXsrfConfiguration**, which is crucial for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.\r\n\r\n- Is there a known workaround to address the incompatibility between withXsrfConfiguration and relative paths in SSG in Angular 17.\r\n\r\n- Also, if we use proxies and have a relative URL like `/api/product`, this might work with withXsrfConfiguration but not in SSG.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n- Relative URLs like `// (protocol-relative) and / (root-relative)` work with withXsrfConfiguration but not in SSG and Absolute URLs work in SSG but not with withXsrfConfiguration.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.2\r\nNode: 21.7.1 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.2\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.2\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.3.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular SSG: Incompatibility between withXsrfConfiguration( ) (HttpClient) & Relative Paths in SSG\" (#55635)"},{"Id":"2275604296","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T13:53:04","Actor":"csfeijo","Number":"55634","RawContent":null,"Title":"Async SVG files could not be loaded when the zone.js is present as peer dependency","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nzone.js\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAsync files was not loaded when the zone.js is present in the same project.\r\n\r\nInside the file: *zone.js:~1712* when the globalZoneAwareCallback is commented the async files could be loaded again:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // global shared zoneAwareCallback to handle all event callback with capture = false\r\n  const globalZoneAwareCallback = function (event) {\r\n      //return globalCallback(this, event, false);\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my another library the SVG files are loaded with this approach:\r\n```\r\n  const { [assetName]: asset } = await import(`@sicredi/react-assets/dist/images/index.esm.js`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, basically some error occurs and the file is not loaded because the zone.js XHR/Event prototyping.\r\n\r\nWe are not using the zone.js directly in the project, we are using the \"@grafana/faro-web-tracing\" dependency, that´s load the \"@opentelemetry/context-zone\", and filanny this last one uses the \"zone.js\" dependency to work.\r\n\r\nHere some UI examples with the code NOT commented and commented respectivelly:\r\n\r\n*Zone.js native code - (*globalZoneAwareCallback  not commented*)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/25899/d61849be-63c5-4020-bc94-571ed62e01e2)\r\n\r\n*Zone.js native code - (*with globalZoneAwareCallback  commented*)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/25899/57733663-9f5d-42c3-84f3-fa233e362684)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nReact 17.0.2\r\nNode: 14.21.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.4.18\r\nOS: Windows64 / Linux 64\r\n\r\nProject using \"@grafana/faro-web-tracing\" => \"@opentelemetry/context-zone\" => \"zone.js\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nIn resume if I only import the zone.js directly in my project, the SVG Loading using the async import does´t working.

We initially investigated whether there was a software error and could not see any messages or errors on either the console or the network on devtools. I encountered this error 1-2 times in the development environment. That's why we thought it was a browser-related error and suggested solving the problem with f5. But it was annoying.

The new CLI `@tailwindcss/cli` traverses files in your project and automatically finds the tailwind classes. It works without a tailwind config, which is what the angular builder looks for to support tailwind. The problem is, you have to setup an npm script to invoke the tailwind CLI, and it is seemingly impossible to integrate it into Angular's build process. I've tried lots of weird hacky things.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Tailwind v4 offers a new [postcss plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#using-post-css), but again, there is no way to configure post css in Angular.\r\n\r\nOther issues with using Tailwind v4 in an Angular project:\r\n- `@angular-devkit/build-angular` (v16 and v17) has a peer dependency of `\"tailwindcss\": \"^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0\",`\r\n- Tailwind support is currently [baked into the builder](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L78), making it impossible to support new major versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to be able to use the latest and greatest in our Angular projects. As a start we should remove the peer dependency on old versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to decouple tailwind integration out of this package so it can be configurable by devs.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have an angular 16 project [here](https://github.com/jamie-perkins-sp/angular16-test) with tailwind v4 installed, you have to use the `--force` flag to install dependencies because of the incompatible tailwind peer dep. An npm script \"tailwind\"  has to be run separately from the build, so for every style change you have to rerun the command.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nv16 and v17\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting Tailwind v4\" (#27585)"},{"Id":"2276122721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:40:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27584","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): shorten application migration description","State":"open","Body":"The description for the optional application builder migration is shown within the optional migration selection prompt.

I accidentally ran into some of these limits. I had to grab a calculator, the build output, make some assumptions, run some calculations, before I could actually understand what these options meant.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these were unambiguous.\r\n\r\nThe generated project limits rules-as-written are:\r\n\r\n- Initial maximum warning: 500 kilobits\r\n- Initial maximum error: 1millibit\r\n- Any component style maximum warning: 2 kilobits\r\n- Any component style maximum error: 6 kilobits\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's assume that the the `m` in `m` should be `M`, that's a factor 10⁹ difference, but ¹/₁₀₀₀ bits makes no sense here, since we're talking about real storage here. I've only ever used millibits in calculations on pure information.\r\n\r\nI analysed this output:\r\n\r\n> Budget 500.00 kB was not met by 589.00 kB with a total of 1.06 MB\r\n\r\nThis quickly points in the direction that the `b` should be a `B`, it's bytes, not bits.\r\nFinally if I run some calculations on this, it clears up another thing (but the output is faulty here too).\r\n\r\n(500 + 589)×10³ ≠ 1.06 × 10⁶ (rules-as-written ISO prefixes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ ≠ 1.06 × 10³ × 2¹⁰ (floppy disk megabytes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ = 1.06 × 10²⁰ (actually intended ISO/IEC 80000-13 binary prefix standard)\r\n\r\nFrom this I can conclude that the numbers used in calculations are actually using the binary measures according to ISO/IEC 80000 (which is the most common for modern systems AFAIK), and the `k` should be `ki` and the `m` should ultimately be `Mi`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it's no trivial matter to understand what the configuration file actually means with these values.\r\n\r\nWhile not a big priority, it is annoying.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`ng g new app`\r\nCheck `angular.json` » project » app » architect » build » configuration » production » budgets\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.6\r\nNode: 22.0.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1703.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n    \r\nWarning: The current version of Node (22.0.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27580","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Confusing project budgets\" (#27580)"},{"Id":"2274369525","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T00:02:05","Actor":"titan-ron","Number":"27577","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support `~` path for `dev-server` ssl","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Doing so will immediately open the `share` submenu instead, no matter how fast the action is done (unless its faster than the refresh rate of the monitor)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThat moving the mouse along a diagonal line only opens a different subMenu if the mouse took too long to travel.\r\nsee https://rawgit.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim/master/example/example.html for an example\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe different submenus disappear immediately.\r\n\r\nFrom my limited debugging I was able to glean that the issue seems to stem from the PointerTracker, where the `_getItemPointerEntries()` stream doesn't seem to get output any value on entering children menu items, while the exit is called every time, meaning the `previousElement` and `activeElement` are set as undefined for the duration of the mouse interaction with the menu items and submenus.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 17.3.6\r\n- CDK: 17.3.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28986","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTargetMenuAim): directive does not really work\" (#28986)"},{"Id":"2273657590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T14:59:27","Actor":"Sathishhari196","Number":"28985","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelect): Mat-select click event is not happening with focus","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n(focus)=\"matselectTemplateRef.open()\r\nAlong with it one more click event is used.  we use both event for same mat-select and on focus if we call open() then only focus is triggered for both click and focus event. \r\n\r\n[https://stackblitz.com/edit/w6h39v-nzk8nh?file=src%2Fexample%2Fselect-multiple-example.html](url)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure consistency between simultaneous transactions. This means each transaction may see different rows -- and different numbers of rows -- in a table.

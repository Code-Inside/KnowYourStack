Interestingly, the component library builds successfully without needing a module to provide DatePipe.\n\nHowever, the application only runs if I add DatePipe to the providers array in main.ts within my test harness. This shouldnâ€™t be a requirement for a component libraryâ€”I want to avoid tightly coupling the library to any consuming application in this way.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue:\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce the \"No Provider for DatePipe\" Error in Angular 19 Component Library**\n\n#### **1. Create a New Angular Component Library**\n   - Generate a new Angular workspace with a library:\n     ```sh\n     ng new my-workspace --create-application=false\n     cd my-workspace\n     ng generate library my-lib\n     ```\n   - Navigate to the `projects/my-lib` directory.\n\n#### **2. Create a Component That Uses `DatePipe`**\n   - Inside `projects/my-lib/src/lib/`, create a new component:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate component date-display\n     ```\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to use `DatePipe`:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **3. Ensure `NgModule` is Removed (Standalone Component)**\n   - Modify `date-display.component.ts` to make it a standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'lib-date-display',\n       standalone: true,\n       template: '<p>{{ today | date }}</p>',\n       providers: [DatePipe]  // Providing DatePipe here\n     })\n     export class DateDisplayComponent {\n       today = new Date();\n       \n       constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) {\n         console.log(this.datePipe.transform(this.today, 'longDate'));\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### **4. Build the Library**\n   - Run:\n     ```sh\n     ng build my-lib\n     ```\n   - The build should succeed without errors.\n\n#### **5. Create a Test Application**\n   - Generate a new Angular application to test the library:\n     ```sh\n     ng generate application test-app\n     ```\n   - Add the library to the application:\n     ```sh\n     ng add my-lib\n     ```\n\n#### **6. Use the Component in the Test Application**\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.html` and add:\n     ```html\n     <lib-date-display></lib-date-display>\n     ```\n   - Open `test-app/src/app/app.component.ts` and import the standalone component:\n     ```typescript\n     import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n     import { DateDisplayComponent } from 'my-lib';\n\n     @Component({\n       selector: 'app-root',\n       standalone: true,\n       imports: [DateDisplayComponent],\n       template: '<lib-date-display></lib-date-display>'\n     })\n     export class AppComponent {}\n     ```\n\n#### **7. Run the Application**\n   ```sh\n   ng serve test-app\n   ```\n   - **Expected Behavior:** The app should run without issues.\n   - **Actual Behavior:** A runtime error occurs:  \n     ```\n     Error: NG0203: No provider for DatePipe!\n     ```\n\n#### **8. Workaround: Add `DatePipe` to `main.ts`**\n   - Modify `test-app/src/main.ts` to provide `DatePipe` globally:\n     ```typescript\n     import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n     import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';\n     import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\n     import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n     bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n       providers: [DatePipe]\n     });\n     ```\n   - **Now the application runs correctly.**\n\n### **Issue Summary**\n- The component library builds successfully.\n- Despite providing `DatePipe` at the component level, Angular still throws a \"No Provider\" error at runtime.\n- The app only works when `DatePipe` is provided at the application level (`main.ts`), which **forces tight coupling** between the library and the consuming application.\n\n### **Expected Behavior**\n- Since `DatePipe` is provided in the standalone component, the app should not require an additional provider in `main.ts`.\n- The component library should be self-contained and not require the consuming application to explicitly provide `DatePipe`.\n\nLet me know if you need any refinements! ðŸš€\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Standalone[_MapMainComponent])[_MapMessageService -> _MapMessageService -> _MapToolsMenubarComponent -> _MenuBarImportService -> _MenuBarImportService -> _DatePipe -> _DatePipe]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for _DatePipe!\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.7\nNode: 22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.7\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.7 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.7\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\n@angular/cli                    19.1.7\n@angular/language-service       19.1.6\n@angular/localize               19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.7\nng-packagr                      19.1.2\nrxjs                            6.6.7\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng19 Component Library Components not recognizing provider DatePipe\" (#59963)"},{"Id":"2854455841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T19:14:24","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"59961","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] build: update babel dependencies to v7.26.9","State":"closed","Body":"This is a Patch PR of #59743\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following updates:\r\n\r\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.0` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.26.0/7.26.9) |\r\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-generator)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.26.5` -> `7.26.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.26.5/7.26.9) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/core)</summary>\r\n\r\n### [`v7.26.9`](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7269-2025-02-14)\r\n\r\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.26.8...v7.26.9)\r\n\r\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\r\n\r\n-   `babel-types`\r\n    -

Then we translate them to Material 3 color palettes with the `var()` function of CSS. The colorpalettes will be the implemented like following:\n\n```SCSS\n:root {\n  --my-selector-0: #000000,\n  ....\n  --my-neutral-0: #000000,\n}\n\n$_palettes: (\n  primary: (\n    0: var(--my-selector-0),\n    10: var(--my-selector-10),\n    20: var(--my-selector-25),\n    25: var(--my-selector-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n  neutral: (\n    0: var(--my-neutral-0),\n    10: var(--my-neutral-10),\n    20: var(--my-neutral-25),\n    25: var(--my-neutral-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n)\n```\n\nBut the `mat.theme` mixin generates transparencies of `neutral-0` which doesn't work, because the is a function which converts the Hex-Color into RGB and then sets the transparency.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a theme with `ng generate @angular/material:theme-color`\n2. Change the `neutral` with hue `0` to a CSS variable which you have defined at root level and set its color to e.g. `#000000`\n3. start the app with\n4. inspect the the `--mat-sys-level` variables\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to insert the transparency RGB colors needed for the `--mat-sys-level1` variables into the `mat.theme` mixin to get working box shadows for e.g. buttons.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInstead of a fancy transparency the `var(--my-neutral-0)` will be shown and the box shadow looks really dark deep and black\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.5\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.3\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theme): mat.theme doesn't support color palettes with CSS variables\" (#30476)"},{"Id":"2848035893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-12T13:06:44","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30475","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular/dev-infra digest to 8a438a3 - autoclosed","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `515b575` -> `8a438a3` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP) using nonces. The backend generates a new nonce for each API call, and includes it in the response headers.\n\nIn Angular, Iâ€™m using an HTTP interceptor to capture the nonce from the response and store it for further use. However, Iâ€™m not sure how to:\n\n\t1.\tApply this dynamic nonce to inline scripts or other DOM elements that require it, since the nonce changes during the session.\n\n\t2.\tUpdate the nonce dynamically without breaking CSP when the user navigates or when new scripts/components are loaded.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tâ€¢\tWhat is the best way to apply a changing nonce to scripts in Angular?\n\n\tâ€¢\tIs there a way to bind or inject the updated nonce into script tags dynamically during a session?\n\n\tâ€¢\tAny best practices for syncing CSP headers and Angular content when nonces change frequently?\n\nAny guidance or example implementations would be appreciated!\n \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61115","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to handle dynamic CSP nonce in Angular with Java backend (nonce changes on every API call)\" (#61115)"},{"Id":"3038016479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-04T13:41:25","Actor":"mcelotti","Number":"61114","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add documentation for \"npm link\"","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI think it would be beneficial to add some details about the \"npm link\" technique to the \"Creating Libraries\" page, as it can help connect and debug multiple libraries while working on an Angular project.\n\nOn top of using \"npm link\", we benefit from:\n- Auto-reload when library code changes\n- The ability to \"npm link\" only selected libraries\n- Fine-grained permissions and DevOps independence, as it's not a monorepo setup\n- Familiarity with other npm-based projects (both backend and frontend) that follow the same \"npm link\" approach\n\nThanks!\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tools/libraries/creating-libraries\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nBest practices and common patterns for using \"npm link\" with Angular libraries.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nI needed to connect and debug multiple libraries while working on my Angular project.

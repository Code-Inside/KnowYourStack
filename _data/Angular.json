(fully ready)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously we have caching within our CDN so it's not TOO slow, but when delivering a response from Universal SSR you kind of get this: appReady: false..... true....... false....... true.\r\n\r\nWe've been using TransferState to cache things like so:\r\n```ts\r\nreturn cmsCache.has(CACHE_KEY) ? cmsCache.get(CACHE_KEY) : cmsService.fetchSomething(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe sent that data to the browser and re-hydrated like so:\r\n```ts\r\nexport const CACHE_STATE_KEY = makeStateKey<any>('api-cache.state');\r\nexport const apiCache = new Map<ApiCacheKey | string, any>();\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n// SSR hydration and dehydration of the cache\r\nif (transferState.hasKey(CACHE_STATE_KEY)) {\r\n  const state = transferState.get(CACHE_STATE_KEY, {});\r\n  for (const key of Object.keys(state)) {\r\n    apiCache.set(key, state[key]);\r\n  }\r\n} else {\r\n  transferState.onSerialize(CACHE_STATE_KEY, () => Object.fromEntries(apiCache.entries()));\r\n  apiCache.clear();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow since Angular 16 there's experimental DOM Hydration and automatic HTTP Caching I thought great, I can delete most of my custom code and just use that.\r\n\r\nAfter testing it, it mostly looked good but I noticed that there are a few API requests being made in both server and client. If I add logging to those, I can see them being made in both places but they never get added to TransferState. After some digging I found the culprits:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/http/src/transfer_cache.ts#L170C1-L172C14\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/universal/blob/main/modules/common/src/transfer_http.ts#L82-L89\r\n\r\nFor caching and transferState to be used, the application needs to do everything before the first ready state and can't be: unready/ready/unready/ready (as more requests/pending tasks are discovered).\r\n\r\nIs there any reaason for it to work like this? It can't be correct because Universal still doesn't return the response until all of that is 100% settled anyway, so shouldn't the caching/transferstate also work the same way?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, either:\r\n - The logic for when universal should stop what it's doing and deliver the response, should be the same as when cache and TransferState stop recording\r\n - Cache and TransferState shouldn't stop recording until Universal is fully ready and delivers the response\r\n\r\nI'm assuming there's something I'm missing here for why it works the way it does.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.1\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.2\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout            15.0.0-beta.42\r\n@angular/material               16.2.2\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\r\nwebpack                         5.88.2\r\nzone.js                         0.13.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the only way for me proceed is to either:\r\n- Copy/Paste all logic and provide it myself using the private APIs\r\n- Hack my application to force all 3x requests (A, B, C) to be in a single observable and wait for it, instead of letting universal discover when it's ready based on what appears in the DOM and what is newly discovered.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51741","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"provideClientHydration does not wait for a waterfall of requests for caching\" (#51741)"},{"Id":"1892507132","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-12T13:17:23","Actor":"Nvveen","Number":"51740","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Devtools don't work when launching from VSCode with \"--user-data-dir\"","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI am running a debugging Chrome instance from a Remote Docker Devcontainer from VSCode.

Because there's no documented reason for _why_ this restriction is in place, I'm now deeming this unnecessary. Developers should not be restricted in this manner. Instead, configs that may have caused infinite redirects in the past should be updated to not be infinite. It is confusing to ignore configs with redirects after an absolute redirect occurred because it creates different matching rules depending on the whether an absolute redirect has happened or not.\r\n\r\nFor additional context on why I believe removing this restriction is\r\nnecessary, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13373 asks for allowing `redirectTo` to be a function. It\r\nwould make sense to allow this function to return a `UrlTree` like other\r\nguards in the Router. When guards in the `Router` return `UrlTree`, they\r\ncancel the current navigation and start a new one to re-do the route\r\nmatching. Since we're already in the router matching part, we don't need\r\nto cancel the navigation. However, the restriction on absolute redirects\r\nhere then creates a weird situation where developers wouldn't see any\r\nother redirects if they returned a `UrlTree` as an absolute redirect\r\nfrom `redirectTo`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Absolute redirects no longer prevent further redirects.

Technically speaking this should be an anti-pattern since the ng-module could contain some runtime logic (e.g., providing something, calling some services, etc) and its not being loaded leads to unexpected behaviour. However, in many cases ng-module is an empty class and its only usage is for providing scope, and since in AoT full compilation mode we already hard-code dependencies into components so we can get away with not loading the ng-module. But in AoT local compilation mode it is not possible to get away since the component's dependencies are computed in runtime and the presence of the corresponding ng-module in the browser is needed. For this reason in this change it is forbidden to attempt to render a component without first loading its ng-module in local compilation mode and an explicit error message is created to make this situation clear. This error message can help with catching such cases when running TGP in Google.\r\n\r\nIt would be an interesting question as to whether to ban this situation in full compilation mode as well, as it is error prone and these errors are sometimes very hard to debug.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Run `ng serve -c example`, open browser on `http://127.0.0.1:4200` and you should see the `404` page as listed above.\r\n7. Exit and and run `ng serve -c example`, open browser on `http://127.0.0.1:4200` and you should see that the server has started and the application is initialized.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n`\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.1\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25806","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The builder @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild not starting server for custom config\" (#25806)"},{"Id":"1887898625","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-11T06:25:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25808","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support custom index option paths in Vite-based dev server","State":"closed","Body":"When using the Vite-based development server and a custom `index` build option (not `index.html`), the custom index path will now be used as the root of the development server.

It would be nice to see this change also reflected in Dialog.\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Enables using an existing component that takes in `@Input`(s) in a basic Dialog without creating a wrapper dialog component that exists solely to pass along injected data (admittedly, of questionable value, since many dialogs will need dialog-specific UI/behavior)\r\n- Allows for passing in data to a dialog component in a more symmetric way with non-dialog components\r\n- Eliminates the need to create a dialog data specific interface for type-safe parameter passing to dialog components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27776","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(Dialog): Allow passing in component @Inputs when opening a dialog\" (#27776)"},{"Id":"1886659561","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-07T22:54:46","Actor":"philmayfield","Number":"27775","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelectionList): Spacing too large between checkbox / radio when set to togglePosition=\"before\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15\n\n### Description\n\nUsing a `<mat-selection-list>` component, and setting the options with `<mat-list-option togglePosition=\"before\">` results in too much space between the toggle and the content.

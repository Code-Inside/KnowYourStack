And NGRX was a copy cat of redux, which is a react package that was created for issues with react state management not angular. And some angular teachers scam and teach this product even though it’s completely unnecessary. \r\n\r\nAlso, the NX project is a scam and completely unnecessary and works worse than the normal angular commandline and yet a lot of angular teachers teach this instead of teaching, how to use the angular command line better\r\n\r\nMy point is is that angular the framework has existing patterns and strategies that we are using already, and it would be better to popularized the existing strategies rather than make  new redundant strategies and add complexity.\r\n\r\nThere’s plenty of work to be done on the project. For example, the angular material components are very useful and very popular. This project has a lot of potential to grow and improve the angular framework exponentially\r\n\r\nPlease do not fix problems that don’t exist and add complexity to the framework you’re ruining it\r\n\r\nPlease get rid of the rats that are coming up with these terrible ideas\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://angular.io/\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere are some people that are destroying the angular project\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular when they started standalone components, messed up dependency injection and added multiple ways to do the same thing\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nPlease stop destroying the project.

computed with write operations","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nRevival with use case of #50498\r\n\r\nCurrently `signal` produces a writable signal.\r\nCurrently `computed` produces a non writable signal.\r\nWhat I am missing is a `writableComputed`.\r\n\r\nUse case example:\r\nI have a required input called `value` but inside the component I can edit this value without affecting the outside. At the end an apply button is clicked and I emit the new value via an output.\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```ts\r\nclass Test {\r\n  value = input.required<string>();\r\n  tempValue = signal(/*??*/);\r\n  commit = output<string>()\r\n\r\n  onEdit(newValue: string) {\r\n    this.tempValue.set(newValue);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onApply() {\r\n    this.commit.emit(this.tempValue());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe first problem is `tempValue` isn't based on `value`.\r\nThe second problem is when `value` is changed from outside. At this point I wish to discard  `tempValue` and start fresh with the new `value`.\r\nIf I had `writableComputed` I could do:\r\n```ts\r\ntempValue = writableComputed(() => this.value());\r\n```\r\nWhich means anytime `value` changes it becomes the new `tempValue` value. If `tempValue` is edited the new edit is the `tempValue` new value until something gets changed in `value`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA new `writableComputed` which tracks the value inside based on the writeable part and will get reset each time the computed function runs to what it creates.\r\nExamples:\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\n// b is 8\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\nb.set(9);\r\n// A design question - 8 or 9\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\na.set(11);\r\nb.set(9);\r\n// A design question - 12 or 9\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\n// b is 8\r\n// Later\r\nb.set(10)\r\n// b is 10\r\n// Later\r\na.set(20);\r\n// b is 21\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing effect. The downside is with required inputs.\r\n```ts\r\ntempValue = signal<string | undefined>(undefined);\r\neffect(() => this.tempValue.set(this.value()), {allowSignalWrites: true});\r\n```\r\nThis will result in `tempValue` having `undefined` initially and for example in `ngOnInit` it will still have `undefined` although `value` already have the actual value set. Also a computed will have its value set too.\r\nusing `writableComputed` in `ngOnInit` will have the correct computed value.\r\n\r\nAnother option is that scenario hints that something I am doing is wrong from the basis and I would like to hear better suggestions how to handle it.

E.g.:\r\n\r\n- Running the suggested script `ng generate component product-alerts ` yields two lines with `standalone` and `imports` that must be commented out.\r\n- In [start-routing](https://angular.io/start/start-routing), when adding the `ngOnInit()` method, it is not stated that this must be inside `export class ProductDetailsComponent`. E.g., this could be indicated by adding a comment such as `// The ngOnInit() method goes here` in the preceding code snippet.\r\n\r\nBut in general, as with the [previous issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55649) I just reported, this indicates that the site could benefit from some additional user testing. So my feedback is not specifically about the two points above, but rather to recruit novice Angular users (akin to myself) and have them run through the tutorials as part of the documentation process.\r\n\r\n(Also, the stackblitz.com code yields a lot of console errors; this would be nice to avoid in order to focus on the mistakes I am personally responsible for 😊)\r\n\r\nURL: [angular.io/start](https://angular.io/start)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55650","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"More user testing of angular.io\" (#55650)"},{"Id":"2277195727","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T08:32:53","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"55652","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(http): resolve `withRequestsMadeViaParent` behavior with `withFetch`","State":"open","Body":"This commit addresses dependency injection defects when using the `withFetch` API.

Especially for devs new to signals (almost everyone at this point), it can be a counter-intuitive problem source to debug.  And there are already issues reported that can be traced to this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51180\r\n\r\nHere's some example code that I wrote that caused non-obvious problems for me:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconstructor() {\r\n  effect(() => {\r\n    this.calendarRef?.setInput('selected', this.range());\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`this.range` is a signal, and `this.calendarRef` is possibly undefined.  I expected any changes to `range` to trigger the effect, but the optional chaining on the `calendarRef` (which was undefined) prevented `range()` from ever being evaluated and thus tracked as a dependency.  And I believe that even if it wasn't undefined for the first run, if it _ever_ reached undefined while the effect was evaluated, the effect would never run again.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n_At the least_, if the first run of a computed() or effect() callback produces no dependencies (invokes no signals), a runtime warning should show in the console to warn the user that their computed signal/effect will not run again.\r\n\r\nIt might also be useful to warn them if their dependency count drops from >1 to 0, which again means the computed signal/effect will not be evaluated again.\r\n\r\nSimilar to `allowSignalWrites`, the dev could remove these training-wheels warnings by positively expressing that they are intentionally designing a callback that will only be called once/stop being updated at some point.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nIt would likely be harder to implement, but static code analysis could detect the _possibility_ of a zero-dependency computed signal/effect.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether a warning is added, documentation talking about this pitfall would be useful; currently not present as far as I can tell.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55647","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Computed signals and Effects should produce runtime warning if dependencies reaches zero\" (#55647)"},{"Id":"2276404685","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T20:16:20","Actor":"yamidnozu","Number":"55646","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mejorar uso de Pipes","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nMejora de rendimiento en pipes\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA través de seteo de caracteres se propone la mejora de creación de pipes y renderizado con mejor performance\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNinguna","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55646","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mejorar uso de Pipes\" (#55646)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2278742037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-04T05:10:19","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27598","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | patch | `v2.7.1` -> `v2.7.2` |\n| [npm-pick-manifest](https://togithub.com/npm/npm-pick-manifest) | dependencies | patch | [`9.0.0` -> `9.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/npm-pick-manifest/9.0.0/9.0.1) |\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | dependencies | patch | [`18.0.3` -> `18.0.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/18.0.3/18.0.4) |\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | devDependencies | patch | [`18.0.3` -> `18.0.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/18.0.3/18.0.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/bazel-lib (aspect_bazel_lib)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.7.2`](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases/tag/v2.7.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v2.7.1...v2.7.2)\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\n1.

The new CLI `@tailwindcss/cli` traverses files in your project and automatically finds the tailwind classes. It works without a tailwind config, which is what the angular builder looks for to support tailwind. The problem is, you have to setup an npm script to invoke the tailwind CLI, and it is seemingly impossible to integrate it into Angular's build process. I've tried lots of weird hacky things.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Tailwind v4 offers a new [postcss plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#using-post-css), but again, there is no way to configure post css in Angular.\r\n\r\nOther issues with using Tailwind v4 in an Angular project:\r\n- `@angular-devkit/build-angular` (v16 and v17) has a peer dependency of `\"tailwindcss\": \"^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0\",`\r\n- Tailwind support is currently [baked into the builder](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L78), making it impossible to support new major versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to be able to use the latest and greatest in our Angular projects. As a start we should remove the peer dependency on old versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to decouple tailwind integration out of this package so it can be configurable by devs.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have an angular 16 project [here](https://github.com/jamie-perkins-sp/angular16-test) with tailwind v4 installed, you have to use the `--force` flag to install dependencies because of the incompatible tailwind peer dep. An npm script \"tailwind\"  has to be run separately from the build, so for every style change you have to rerun the command.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nv16 and v17\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting Tailwind v4\" (#27585)"},{"Id":"2276093089","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:28:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27583","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27583","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#27583)"},{"Id":"2276078974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:23:28","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27582","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#27582)"},{"Id":"2275772137","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T16:21:58","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27581","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): only generate shallow preload links for initial files","State":"closed","Body":"To remove the potential for a large amount of modulepreload link elements being added to the generating `index.html` for an application, the number of elements is now limited to five.

I've only ever used millibits in calculations on pure information.\r\n\r\nI analysed this output:\r\n\r\n> Budget 500.00 kB was not met by 589.00 kB with a total of 1.06 MB\r\n\r\nThis quickly points in the direction that the `b` should be a `B`, it's bytes, not bits.\r\nFinally if I run some calculations on this, it clears up another thing (but the output is faulty here too).\r\n\r\n(500 + 589)×10³ ≠ 1.06 × 10⁶ (rules-as-written ISO prefixes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ ≠ 1.06 × 10³ × 2¹⁰ (floppy disk megabytes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ = 1.06 × 10²⁰ (actually intended ISO/IEC 80000-13 binary prefix standard)\r\n\r\nFrom this I can conclude that the numbers used in calculations are actually using the binary measures according to ISO/IEC 80000 (which is the most common for modern systems AFAIK), and the `k` should be `ki` and the `m` should ultimately be `Mi`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it's no trivial matter to understand what the configuration file actually means with these values.\r\n\r\nWhile not a big priority, it is annoying.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`ng g new app`\r\nCheck `angular.json` » project » app » architect » build » configuration » production » budgets\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.6\r\nNode: 22.0.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1703.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n    \r\nWarning: The current version of Node (22.0.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27580","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Confusing project budgets\" (#27580)"},{"Id":"2274156450","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T20:38:03","Actor":"everflux","Number":"27576","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve not working behind reverse proxy basehref/servepath","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nbefore vite\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI provide remote training for Angular using VSCode in the browser.\r\nIt is no longer possible to use the vscode port forwarding to access the ng dev server as basehref and servepath combinations to not yield the correct result when @angular node resources are to be loaded.

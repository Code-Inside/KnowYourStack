For example:\n\n```html\n<section myDummyDirective myDummyDirective>\n  <h2>Section Title</h2>\n  <p>Awesome content goes here...</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nThis code compiles and runs, but at runtime the first directive instance is destroyed, which can lead to unexpected behavior, subtle bugs, and potential conflicts.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a compiler warning that detects duplicate directive usage on the same element. \n- Detect when the same directive appears more than once on a single element.\n- Emit a diagnostic warning with a clear message.\n- Continue allowing compilation, but alert developers of potential issues.\n\nMessage \n```text\n Duplicate directive 'myDummyDirective' found on the same element. The first instance will be destroyed at runtime.

This can occur when user input is treated as JavaScript, or passed to a framework which interprets it as an expression to be evaluated. Examples include AngularJS expressions or JQuery selectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFix the issue, we must either:  \r\n- Validate and restrict `cols` and `rows` so that only safe values (e.g. integers within an expected range) are allowed through, OR  \r\n- Escape or sanitize the values before inserting into the JSON string.\r\n\r\nThe preferred fix here is to ensure that only valid, numeric values for `cols` and `rows` are used when constructing the JSON string for the hydration annotation. This can be achieved by parsing `cols` and `rows` to integers, defaulting to safe values if parsing fails, and explicitly rejecting or sanitizing any non-numeric/unsafe input. This should be done at the point just before their usage in the script content, namely in the `setupTransferState` function in `modules/benchmarks/src/hydration/table.ts`.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\n- In `setupTransferState`, parse `cols` and `rows` to integers, fallback to safe defaults if the values are not valid positive integers.\r\n- Use only these sanitized values for string interpolation in the script’s JSON content.\r\n- No changes required for imports or external libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [x] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

(These are from the [Pointer Lock](https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/) specification, the rest of which is not implemented.)\n- Added `customElements.getName()`. (mash-graz)\n- Updated the [virtual console](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/ab384d4e381eb6bb99ade4146698d35167b54837/README.md#virtual-consoles):\n  - `\"jsdomError\"` events are now documented, with specific `type` properties and other properties that depend on the type.\n  - `sendTo()` was renamed to `forwardTo()`.\n  - The `jsdomErrors` option to `forwardTo()` can be used to control which errors are sent to the Node.js console. This replaces the previous `omitJSDOMErrors` boolean option.\n  - `\"jsdomError\"`s for failed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches are no longer emitted.\n  - The values that are printed when forwarding `\"jsdomError\"`s to the Node.js console are streamlined.\n- Switched our CSS selector engine from [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/nwsapi) to [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector), closing over 20 selector-related bugs.\n- Upgraded [`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie), which now considers URLs like `http://localhost/` to be secure contexts (per [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy)), and thus will return `Secure`-flagged cookies for such URLs. (colincasey)\n- Upgraded [`cssstyle`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/cssstyle), which brings along many improvements and fixes to the `CSSStyleDeclaration` object and its properties.\n- Updated the user agent stylesheet to be derived from the HTML Standard, instead of from an old revision of Chromium.\n- Changed `element.click()` to fire a `PointerEvent` instead of a `MouseEvent`.\n- Changed certain events to be passive by default.\n- Changed the `<input>` element's `pattern=\"\"` attribute to use the `v` regular expression flag, instead of `u`.\n- Fixed many specification conformance issues with the `Window` object, including named properties and changing various data properties to accessor properties.\n- Fixed `document.createEvent()` to accept a more correct set of event names.\n- Fixed the `ElementInternals` accessibility getters and setters. (They were introduced in v23.1.0, but due to inadequate test coverage never actually worked.)\n- Fixed using `Object.defineProperty()` on certain objects, such as `HTMLSelectElement` instances.\n- Fixed `jsdom.reconfigure({ url })` not updating `document.baseURI` or properties derived from it. (This regressed in v26.1.0.)\n- Fixed CSS system colors, as well as the `initial`, `inherit`, and `unset` keywords, to resolve correctly. (asamuzaK)\n- Fixed CSS `display` style resolution. (asamuzaK)\n\n##### Changes since 27.0.0-beta.3\n\n- Upgraded `cssstyle`, which brings along various CSS parsing fixes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

(These are from the [Pointer Lock](https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/) specification, the rest of which is not implemented.)\n- Added `customElements.getName()`. (mash-graz)\n- Updated the [virtual console](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/ab384d4e381eb6bb99ade4146698d35167b54837/README.md#virtual-consoles):\n  - `\"jsdomError\"` events are now documented, with specific `type` properties and other properties that depend on the type.\n  - `sendTo()` was renamed to `forwardTo()`.\n  - The `jsdomErrors` option to `forwardTo()` can be used to control which errors are sent to the Node.js console. This replaces the previous `omitJSDOMErrors` boolean option.\n  - `\"jsdomError\"`s for failed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches are no longer emitted.\n  - The values that are printed when forwarding `\"jsdomError\"`s to the Node.js console are streamlined.\n- Switched our CSS selector engine from [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/nwsapi) to [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector), closing over 20 selector-related bugs.\n- Upgraded [`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie), which now considers URLs like `http://localhost/` to be secure contexts (per [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy)), and thus will return `Secure`-flagged cookies for such URLs. (colincasey)\n- Upgraded [`cssstyle`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/cssstyle), which brings along many improvements and fixes to the `CSSStyleDeclaration` object and its properties.\n- Updated the user agent stylesheet to be derived from the HTML Standard, instead of from an old revision of Chromium.\n- Changed `element.click()` to fire a `PointerEvent` instead of a `MouseEvent`.\n- Changed certain events to be passive by default.\n- Changed the `<input>` element's `pattern=\"\"` attribute to use the `v` regular expression flag, instead of `u`.\n- Fixed many specification conformance issues with the `Window` object, including named properties and changing various data properties to accessor properties.\n- Fixed `document.createEvent()` to accept a more correct set of event names.\n- Fixed the `ElementInternals` accessibility getters and setters. (They were introduced in v23.1.0, but due to inadequate test coverage never actually worked.)\n- Fixed using `Object.defineProperty()` on certain objects, such as `HTMLSelectElement` instances.\n- Fixed `jsdom.reconfigure({ url })` not updating `document.baseURI` or properties derived from it.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Comments have been put in place to prepare the idea to extend it to later allow for custom output directories. It was not clarified if Google itself are depending on this and might require this, so if this is the case let's quickly revisit it and see how we can expand the current solution.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not certain if it \"breaks\".

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n### [`v10.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.0...v10.15.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `.pnp.cjs` crash when importing subpath [#&#8203;9904](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9904).\n- When resolving peer dependencies, pnpm looks whether the peer dependency is present in the root workspace project's dependencies. This change makes it so that the peer dependency is correctly resolved even from aliased npm-hosted dependencies or other types of dependencies [#&#8203;9913](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9913).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Since I can't show my code, I will be using the example given in the docs to show a few of the weird behaviors I noticed. You can follow along with the [Date range picker forms integration example](https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms) in the docs.\n\nI'm sorry for not using the intended way of creating the bug request but I saw no way to report basically identical bugs in one ticket in another way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**Link**: see description\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n#### Bug 1: Start/end stays invalid, then fixed by proxy\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

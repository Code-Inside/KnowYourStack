it is valid to use `{projectRoot}` and `{workspaceRoot}` tokens in project configuration paths.\n\nFor example, in our `project.json` we define:\n\n```json\n\"build\": {\n  \"executor\": \"@nx/angular:application\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"tsConfig\": \"{projectRoot}/tsconfig.app.json\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis works fine during normal builds because Nx replaces the `{projectRoot}` token at runtime.\n\nHowever, when running Angular migrations such as:\n```\nnpx nx migrate --run-migrations\n```\nand applying migrations like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"19.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Updates non-standalone Directives, Component and Pipes to 'standalone:false' and removes 'standalone:true' from those who are standalone\",\n  \"factory\": \"./bundles/explicit-standalone-flag#migrate\",\n  \"package\": \"@angular/core\",\n  \"name\": \"explicit-standalone-flag\"\n}\n```\n\nthe migration code that reads `tsConfig` paths does not resolve `{projectRoot}` placeholders.\nInstead, it attempts to read files literally at `{projectRoot}/tsconfig.app.json`, causing the migration to skip valid projects.\n\nAs a result, migrations are silently skipped.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b61068a-415f-4ae3-99a4-4a5dd42a38be)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please

After removing [browserslist-useragent-regexp](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp), simplifying my library to JS,  and still getting errors, they asked me to reach out to Angular as they were thinking Angular had an over complicated environment.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a shareable config following browserslist's instructions here: https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist?tab=readme-ov-file#shareable-configs\n\n\nHere is my particular example with text changed as it's for a client I'm working with:\n\n**Snippet of application's package.json:**\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n**Here is the library's code for this config:**\n\nindex.js\n\n```js\n\nconst BROWSERSLIST_QUERY = ['defaults'];\nexport default BROWSERSLIST_QUERY;\n\n```\n\nsnippet of package.json\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')\n    at find (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:12:25)\n    at matchBlock (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:46:10)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:73:17\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\n    at parse (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:70:13)\n    at parseQueries (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:454:16)\n    at resolve (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:322:10)\n    at Function.select (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:1163:14)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:332:29\n    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.8\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.7\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                    19.2.8\n@schematics/angular             19.2.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Type error between Angular CLI and Browserslist when extending a browserslist config\" (#30183)"},{"Id":"3020455763","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T16:02:15","Actor":"Platonn","Number":"30180","RawContent":null,"Title":"In application builder allow for custom styles plugins, e.g. for SCSS paths mapping needed in monorepo with many libraries","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\n**Context - our usecase:**\nWere' developing a set of Angular libraries in a monorepo, where some libs can cross-import SCSS files from other libs, and they should @import them using \"symbolic\" library paths (not relative paths). e.g. in a SCSS file inside the lib A (`@my-org/*lib-A*/styles` ) we'd like to import SCSS from lib B (e.g. `@import '@my-org/*lib-B*/styles'` ).\n\n**Solution with old webpack builder:**\nWith the old Angular `browser` builder it was possible to apply SCSS paths mapping by applying a custom webpack plugin (e.g. using a 3rd party builder `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` which extended the default Angular `browser` builder). See the example defining of paths mapping:\n* example nx `project.json` (but can be `angular.json` ) in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/projects/storefrontapp/project.json#L10-L14\n* example `extra-webpack.config.js` in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/extra-webpack.config.js#L24-L79\n\n**Problem after migrating to esbuild application builder:**\nAfter migrating to the new Angular `application` builder, which is based on esbuild, such a paths mapping no longer works (even when passing analogical custom plugin e.g. via the 3rd party `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild:application`). \n\nNote: we tried passing a custom plugin to [`buildApplication()`'s 3rd argument `extensions.codePlugins`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L152-L155), but it didn't affect the SCSS paths resolution.  Maybe we did something wrong. I guess it's becasue the styles plugins defined in the array below don't take the ambient `extensions.codePlugins` into account. See the source code of Angular CLI:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66\n\nNote 2: I understand that `buildApplication()` has a JSDoc comment [\"@experimental Direct usage of this function is considered experimental.\"](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L145). That said, I'm still hoping we can help improve this function with our feedback, so it addresses needs of authors of custom Angular libraries developed in monorepos.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be nice to be able to inject into `buildApplication()` custom plugins affecting SCSS paths resolution e.g. into the [`plugins` array](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66) in `..../tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts`.\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWorkaround ideas:\nOur ultimate goal is to keep our example app in our monorepo working. And publish our libs so their consumers can import them and it should work in their apps.\n\nSo alternatively we can keep relative paths in our monorepo (e.g. `@import '*lib-b*/....' `. And as a post-build step of a production build of an Angular library (with ng-packgr) we could search-replace with a regex in the /dist folder all the cross-library scss import paths to relevant \"symbolic\" paths (.e.g `@import *@my-org/lib-b*/...`.\nThanks to this, the example app in our monorepo using relative paths would still work (no need for paths mapping in the `application` builder). And users of our libraries would get shipped SCSS sources which are cross-importing other libs' styles via symbolic paths, which will resolve successfully (using their `node_modules/*@my-org/lib-b*/...` )\nThe downside of it is that our example app in our monorepo would differ from our user's apps - which would be a bit confusing to read (and ambigious to diffrentiate it from non-cross-lib other relative imports from inside the same library itself).\n\nNote: I've found a related issue https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23552 but it's old and related to the webpack builder, where workaround with custom webpack plugin was possible. I've created this issue for the purpose of `application` builder, where I hope we could add an API for injecting a custom plugin affecting SCSS (e.g. for a custom paths mapping).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In application builder allow for custom styles plugins, e.g. for SCSS paths mapping needed in monorepo with many libraries\" (#30180)"},{"Id":"3019153360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T08:14:20","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30176","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): ensure `com.chrome.devtools.json` is consistently served after initial run","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nPreviously, `com.chrome.devtools.json` was generated and served correctly on the first run, but subsequent `ng serve` runs failed to serve the file unless the Angular cache was cleared.

However, it may be fixed inside the mat-select code as well. I am not sure where the fix should happen, as I don't if the same behavior occurs elsewhere or if other side effects could be caused.\n\nI was able to implement a workaround for myself by calling a custom scrolling method whenever the _keyManager emits a value in the `change` observable. The custom method is a copy of the original method `_scrollOptionIntoView` from mat-select which currently looks like this:\n\n```typescript\n  /** Scrolls a particular option into the view. */\n  _scrollOptionIntoView(index: number): void {\n    const option = this.options.toArray()[index];\n\n    if (option) {\n      const panel: HTMLElement = this.panel.nativeElement;\n      const labelCount = _countGroupLabelsBeforeOption(index, this.options, this.optionGroups);\n      const element = option._getHostElement();\n\n      if (index === 0 && labelCount === 1) {\n        // If we've got one group label before the option and we're at the top option,\n        // scroll the list to the top. This is better UX than scrolling the list to the\n        // top of the option, because it allows the user to read the top group's label.\n        panel.scrollTop = 0;\n      } else {\n        panel.scrollTop = _getOptionScrollPosition(\n          element.offsetTop,\n          element.offsetHeight,\n          panel.scrollTop,\n          panel.offsetHeight,\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe fix in my workaround is that it passes `element.offsetTop - panel.offsetTop`  as the `optionOffset` parameter instead of `element.offsetTop` when calling the original method `_getOptionScrollPosition` . \n\n```typescript\npanel.scrollTop = _getOptionScrollPosition(\n          element.offsetTop - panel.offsetTop,\n          element.offsetHeight,\n          panel.scrollTop,\n          panel.offsetHeight,\n        );\n  }\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to official select documentation example \"Select with reset option\" https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-reset\n2. Scroll such that the example mat-select is at the bottom of the page so that the overlay will open towards the top\n3. Open mat-select\n4.

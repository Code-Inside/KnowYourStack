I'm a first timer when it comes to open source contributions and I would like to propose the addition of a new Validator: Validators.group(). Here's the expected behavior.\n\n1. If all the fields inside of a group are empty (null or \"\") the form is valid.\n2. If all the fields inside a group have truthy values that pass all the other Validators, the form is valid\n3. Otherwise (in cases where some fields are filled in, and some aren't even if all the individual validators are passed for each control) the form is invalid\n\n**USE CASE**\n\nI'm currently working on a CMS that allows the user to fill in forms in order to add. new woodworking projects. The form contains the following fields: \n\n1. Title \n2. Material\n3. Description \n4. Production Year\n5.  Thumbnail Image\n6. Height\n7. Width\n8. Depth\n9. Units\n\n\nAs you can probably tell, height, width, depth, and units all craft a single piece of information that can't be properly displayed if all 4 fields aren't present.\n\nSince in my case, not all projects required dimensions, I didn't use Validators.required \n\nIn this case, i think it would be beneficial if there was an option to group these inputs together making sure that either all of them are filled in, and pass all other validators specified or all of them are empty, or none of them are filled in, in which case everything would be fine as well since they weren't required.\n\nNote: This means that Validators.group() and Validators.required can't be on the same FormControl\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new validator, Validators.group that expects a string that should be something that ties the inputs you want to group together. In the example above this would probably be 'dimensions' \n\nExample code:\n\n`height: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group('dimensions')\n      ]),`\n`width: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group('dimensions')\n      ]),`\n`depth: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group('dimensions')\n      ]),`\n`units: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.pattern(/^(\"|mm|cm|m|ft)$/) \n        Validators.group('dimensions')\n      ]),`\n\nand then in the template:\n\n`@if(form.get('width')?.errors?.['group']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\nThe error would trigger if the state of the fields (either empty or not) was different within the fields in the same group. Developers would be able to configure whether they want to throw the error on all the fields in the group, only the empty ones or only the non-empty ones. For this to work you would need to put in HTML similar to the example above for every input in the same group. So that would be:\n\n`@if(form.get('height')?.errors?.['group']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('width')?.errors?.['group']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('depth')?.errors?.['group']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('units')?.errors?.['group']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n\nIf there are multiple validation groups within the same FormGroup we would check which validation group our form field is a part of and throw the appropriate error message\n\nIf the same form field is a part of multiple groups then the only solution I can think of if we're going with this approach would be something like this\n\n`@if(form.get('width')?.groupErrors?.['dimensions']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n\n`@if(form.get('width')?.groupErrors?.['dimensions-numeric-values']) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in all 3 dimensions</p>\n          }`\n\n\nObviously, feedback is very appreciated since I'm a novice at open source contributions. I've been working with Angular for a year so I don't have a ton of experience, please point out any problems with this implementation that you find.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAn alternative solution that would make the last situation i described a bit simpler would be to add types to Validation groups.\n\nSo something like this:\n\n`import { ValidatorGroup } from '@angular/forms';`\n\n`dimensionsGroup: ValidatorGroup // ValidatorGroup would be a new type that would basically be an array of AbstractControls tied to the validation group. It would initialize after all FormControls and FormGroups`\n\nand with this approach the syntax would be as follows:\n\n`height: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group(dimensionsGroup)\n      ]),`\n`width: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group(dimensionsGroup)\n      ]),`\n`depth: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.min(0),\n        Validators.pattern(/^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$/)\n        Validators.group(dimensionsGroup)\n      ]),`\n`units: new FormControl('', [\n        Validators.pattern(/^(\"|mm|cm|m|ft)$/) \n        Validators.group(dimensionsGroup)\n      ]),`\n\n\nand then in the template\n\n\n`@if(form.get('height')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroup]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('width')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroup]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('depth')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroup]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n`@if(form.get('units')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroup]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n\nand then if an input is part of multiple Validation groups\n\n\n`@if(form.get('width')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroup]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in the rest of the dimensions fields</p>\n          }`\n\n`@if(form.get('width')?.groupErrors?.[dimensionGroupValues]) {\n            <p class=\"text-red-500 text-xs mt-1\">Please fill in all 3 dimensions</p>\n          }`\nAgain, feedback is very appreciated. I hope I explained everything, if there's anything that doesn't make sense please ask.

Note that this is based on a couple other PRs and will be rebased when they are merged, only the last commit is relevant to this discussion._\r\n\r\nContext: Angular DevTools uses the `ng` global to interact with an Angular application and it has some unique versioning constraints. Because Angular DevTools is released independently and auto-updates in the browser, it is consistently at or near the latest version even when developers might be working on a years-out-of-date Angular app. However the `ng` global is shipped with the Angular framework version. As a result, Angular DevTools cannot assume the application uses an up-to-date `ng` implementation and must support all previous versions of the `ng` API which have ever shipped in an Angular framework release.\r\n\r\nInternally (meaning inside google3) things work differently. There is exactly one version of the framework which is consistently evolving at HEAD. Any given application just uses the current HEAD at the time of any particular build. Therefore, Angular's \"version\" is effectively meaningless. Semver does not apply and any breaking change is allowed at any time provided the team takes the effort to migrate affected users. This means Angular DevTools does *not* need to support older `ng` implementations because we do not have \"long-lived\" Angular versions internally. Note that http://go/build-horizon does technically apply, but for debug tooling like this is not really a significant problem.\r\n\r\nThis divergence in versioning constraints creates a challenge where internal use cases of the `ng` global interface are throttled by external versioning requirements. The team is generally hesitant to add new functions or make breaking changes because of the maintenance burden it places on Angular DevTools which will need to support that API for the forseeable future, even if we eventually change it later. From an internal perspective, this slows down iteration of APIs for no practical benefit given that internal apps don't have the versioning constraints this pace is designed to support.\r\n\r\nThis commit splits the `ng` global interface into two interfaces:\r\n* `ExternalGlobalUtils` includes all the functionality which has been shipped in a long-lived Angular version externally and which is subject to the versioning constraints described above.\r\n* `InternalGlobalUtils` includes internal-only functionality which has **not** been shipped in a long-lived Angular version.\r\n\r\nThis split means that all APIs in `InternalGlobalUtils` can be iterated and evolved at a much faster pace. Angular DevTools can support those features, and we can make breaking changes more-or-less whenever we want. The downside is that external Angular developers cannot take advantage of those APIs or else we would be subject to the same versioning constraint we're trying to avoid here.\r\n\r\nThis means we can use `InternalGlobalUtils` as a kind of \"beta\" channel for new DevTools APIs. Once that functionality is validated and the design is stabilized, the feature can be moved into `ExternalGlobalUtils` and made available for external Angular developers when we're ready to commit to the long-lived version constraint. This will hopefully help us strike a better balance between iterating on new APIs quickly and maintaining stable APIs for external Angular users.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60214","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): split global utils type into internal and external versions\"

Description\n\n# Host Directive Input Binding Not Working with Router Data\n\n## Description\nWhen using `withComponentInputBinding()` with the Router, input bindings for host directives fail to receive values from route data, while component inputs work correctly.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```typescript\n@Directive()\nexport class HelloComponentStore {\n  readonly hostDirectiveInputValue =

Clearly:\r\n\r\n- we will still support contributors on Windows, and we believe we will be improving and streamlining the experience here\r\n- we will continue testing the Angular CLI for our Windows users. We are aware of the many Windows users using the `ng` CLI.\r\n\r\nWhat is changing? We are no longer actively working towards a Bazel infrastructure that supports native Windows building and testing. There are currently two ways to contribute to Angular on Windows. That is via WSL, or via e.g. native Windows cmd.exe, with Git Bash on top. We acknowledge that the latter worked sometimes, but we also realize it very often breaks as nobody on our team uses, verifies it, and it introduces extra complexity because Bazel on Windows is quite disconnected from Linux/Mac (e.g. no sandboxing). Going forward, to improve our team's effectiveness, and improve our stability guarantees for Windows (and Windows contributors), we are actively discouraging the use of Git Bash for contributing to Angular; but instead ask for WSL to be used.

This is because it expects [two `mousemove` events internally](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L677) in order to correctly identity the target element. For the first time we end up in the handler, it should go into [this condition](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L680) and identify the target element. The second time it should (does not) go into [this condition](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L728).\n\nWhile technically in common use-cases it doesn't happen much that there is only a single `mousemove` event under special conditions, e.g. using a Pen/Stylus its probably possible so I recommend removing this early-return which would make it work for Playwright:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L712\n\nPlaywright bug:

option to NOT truncate, a long/multi-line mat-label within a mat-form-field","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWe have a situation where we need a very short input (4 digits) but it has a very long label.\nMUCH wider than the required input, and sometimes, much wider than the parent container/page.\n\nUnfortunately, specifying a size on the mat-form-field not only resizes the input, it also resizes and truncates the label to the point of uselessness.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn the first field below, we've set the `mat-form-field` style to `width: 16.666667%`\n\nSmall input with truncated label:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4f0700a-be3a-4983-90d6-7668ecc2fce7)\n\nUpdated styles with label width 600% to match the parent container (6 x 16.666667%)\nThis _does_ make the label the full width, however, it's still not big enough to display the full text:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n}\n```\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c340ece-dbc6-48b8-91a0-d8b865bbae04)\n\nSo, we added wrapping, to ensure the full label (and the trailing tooltip icon component within the label) is displayed:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n    text-wrap: auto;\n}\n```\nUnfortunately, this then overlaps the input, as the position of the label is hard-coded in the material styles...\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86cbd5-f059-443d-849f-6c3f3132da89)\n\nGiven the DOM of the component after rendering, I can't see any simple way to untangle this problem.\n\nObviously, on mobile devices this problem is exacerbated substantially:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e24f13-2293-4010-9910-9fb56974cc80)\n\nAny

This happens, because we generate the `setClassMetadata` call directly from the source AST which contains identifiers that TS will rename when it emits the ES5 code.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by looking through the metadata AST and cloning any `Identifier` that is referring to the class.

That makes a total of **zero** sense to me. The HTML template language is already far beyond what vanilla HTML offers, and that is the entire point of using a framework like Angular. Many other major frameworks (React/Vue/Svelte to name a few) already support self-closing component tags.\r\n\r\nI understand that Angular templates were being parsed in the browser before, but why should ease-of-life syntax sugar be banned when using AOT compilation? Sure, some people still use JIT-compiled Angular, but then again, some people still use Internet Explorer in 2020. If they want to suffer so be it but why refuse to add excellent features for the rest of us? There are plenty of antifeatures out there but I personally think self-closing tags are pretty intuitive and improve the code quality significantly; from the looks of #673 it seems like a lot of other people agree.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider self-closing component tags.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nContinue to sigh as I write needlessly verbose code and write checks for two different nullish types.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39525","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Self-closing component tags (<my-comp/> instead of <my-comp></my-comp>)?\" (#39525)"},{"Id":"733828302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T23:38:48","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"39524","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic component detectChanges trigger ngDoCheck but not refresh view","State":"open","Body":"This is a related issue of #36667. \r\nReproduce live demo is here.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vz1dca?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts\r\n\r\ncode is this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {\r\n  Component,\r\n  NgModule,\r\n  ViewContainerRef,\r\n  ComponentFactoryResolver,\r\n  Injector,\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy,\r\n  DoCheck\r\n} from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\r\n\r\nimport { timer } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"dynamic\",\r\n  template: `\r\n    {{ name }}\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class Dynamic implements DoCheck {\r\n  name = \"initial name\";\r\n\r\n  ngDoCheck() {\r\n    console.log(\"docheck dynamic\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"my-app\",\r\n  template: `\r\n    <b>Expected</b>: \"initial name\" changes to \"changed name\" after 2s<br />\r\n    <b>Actual</b>:<br />\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _vcRef: ViewContainerRef,\r\n    private _cfr: ComponentFactoryResolver,\r\n    private _injector: Injector\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    const cmptRef = this._cfr\r\n      .resolveComponentFactory(Dynamic)\r\n      .create(this._injector);\r\n    this._vcRef.insert(cmptRef.hostView);\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      cmptRef.instance.name = \"changed name\";\r\n      console.log(\"changing name\");\r\n      cmptRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent, Dynamic],\r\n  entryComponents: [Dynamic],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is for `dynamic component`, there is a host view as a placeholder, the `hooks` are registered on the host view not the component view, when calling `componentRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`, it will run change detection from root host view, and trigger the `doCheck hook`, but when it really want to refresh child component, since it is a onPush component and not marked dirty, it will not be refreshed. \r\n\r\nI will try to resolve this issue in #39463 too.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dynamic component detectChanges trigger ngDoCheck but not refresh view\" (#39524)"},{"Id":"733754655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T16:16:38","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"39523","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): recover unterminated property and event bindings","State":"open","Body":"This commit enables the formation of partially-complete r3 asts even\r\nwhen semantically invalid property/event/two-way bindings of the\r\n()/[]/[()] syntax are discovered.\r\n\r\nPart of #38596","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39523","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler): recover unterminated property and event bindings\" (#39523)"},{"Id":"733714138","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T12:59:31","Actor":"eliraneliassy","Number":"39521","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add eliran eliassy to GDE list","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

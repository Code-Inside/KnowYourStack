This is possible thanks to the `share` rxjs operator.\r\nBy doing that I optimize the amount of request to Firestore and keep the last value in cache.\r\n\r\nI tried to switch to the signal API to reduce my dependency to zone.js (which has some issues with Firebase) but there is no way to track how many elements are listening on the changes of the signal. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCreate an API that return the amount of active listeners on a signal. Maybe something like that : \r\n```typescript\r\nconst counter = signal(0);\r\nconst listeners = signalListeners(counter); // returns a Signal<number> with value 0 by default\r\nconst ref1 = effect(() => console.log(counter())); // `listeners`'s value is now 1\r\nconst isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2);\r\nconst ref2 = effect(() => console.log(isEven())); // `listeners`'s value is now 2\r\nref1.destroy();  // `listeners`'s value is now 1\r\n```\r\nHere is how I would use it : \r\n```typescript\r\nsignals: Record<string, WritableSignal> = {};\r\nlisteners: Record<string, Signal<number>> = {};\r\neffects: Record<string, EffectRef> = {};\r\n\r\ndoc(ref: DocumentRef) {\r\n  const isRegistered = ref.path in this.effects;\r\n  this.signals[ref.path] ||= signal(undefined);\r\n  this.listeners[ref.path] ||= signalListeners(this.signales[ref.path]);\r\n  if (!this.effects[ref.path]) {\r\n    let previous = 0;\r\n    let unsubscribe: () => void;\r\n    this.effects[ref.path]effect((cleanup) => {\r\n      const listeners = this.listeners[ref.path]();\r\n      // Start listening on first listener \r\n      if (!previous && listeners) {\r\n        unsubscribe = onSnapshot(ref, (snap) => this.signals[ref.path].set(snap)).unsubscribe;\r\n      }\r\n      // Stop listening when there is no listeners\r\n      if (previous && !listeners) {\r\n        unsubscribe();\r\n      }\r\n      previous = listeners;\r\n      cleanup(() => unsubscribe());\r\n    }, {\r\n      manualCleanup: true\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n return this.signals[ref.path];\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Cleanup everything if service is destroy\r\nngOnDestroy() {\r\n  for (const key in this.effects) {\r\n    this.effects[key].destroy();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently at best I can know how many components have requested a document by adding an `effect` on very request, but there is no way to know if any of these component is actually listening on the signal changes. Also if the signal is used inside an `*ngIf=\"false\"` then we shouldn't listen on Firestore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50182","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal - provide a way to know if there is listeners\" (#50182)"},{"Id":"1697853313","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T15:47:34","Actor":"tomscript","Number":"50167","RawContent":null,"Title":"using provideClientHydration does not consistently show hydration stats in dev","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n1. clone the poc repo https://github.com/tomscript/sturdy-octo-spork\r\n```\r\nnpm i -f\r\nnpm run dev:ssr\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou will not see any hydration stats\r\n- note in **auctions.component** I have `ngSkipHydration` on `app-auctions-slider`. \r\n- this component is causing issues because it modifies the DOM. however I have it marked explictly to skip hydration.

It has only one component inside which I have a few SELECT fields. Everything worked fine until I decided to use SplitChunks plugin of webpack to split all the node_modules stuff into a separate vendor bundle and include it separately.\r\n\r\nMy application is not using any builder, it was never built using any building tool such as angular-cli. I built it from scratch, wrote my own main.ts, module.ts, and app.component.ts, and wrote my own webpack.config.js.\r\n\r\nThe error I got at runtime was\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Promise rejection: Errors during JIT compilation of template for AppComponent: Sys.ParameterCountException: Sys.ParameterCountException: Parameter count mismatch. \r\n```\r\n\r\nI experimented with the problem and tried to isolate it and here are some interesting findings.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of interpolation bindings like the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{ firstName }}\r\n```\r\nI changed the above to the following and it started working :)\r\n\r\n\r\n`<span [innerText]=\"firstName\" ></span>`\r\n\r\n\r\nI added all sorts of crazy things such as *ngFor, *ngIf, banana-in-the-box bindings [()]  and no compiler errors.

I'm updating to Angular 16 and I've found a significally difference with the resulted compiled code between typescript 4.9.4 and 5.0.4\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the problematic code:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class IssueService {\r\n  #throwIfUndefined = this.assertIfPropertyIsDefined();\r\n\r\n  constructor(private readonly property) {}\r\n\r\n  assertIfPropertyIsDefined() {\r\n    if (!this.property) {\r\n      throw new Error('the property should be defined');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing Typescript 4.9.4 the service is transpiled to:\r\n```ts\r\n    __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n        /* harmony export */\r\n        __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, {\r\n            /* harmony export */\r\n            \"IssueService\": ()=>(/* binding */\r\n            IssueService)/* harmony export */\r\n        });\r\n        /* harmony import */\r\n        var _xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldInitSpec_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! ./node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/classPrivateFieldInitSpec.js */\r\n        4482);\r\n        /* harmony import */\r\n        var _xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldSet_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__ = __webpack_require__(/*! ./node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/classPrivateFieldSet.js */\r\n        692);\r\n\r\n        var _throwIfUndefined = /*#__PURE__*/\r\n        new WeakMap();\r\n        class IssueService {\r\n            // Get attention to these lines\r\n            constructor(property) {\r\n                (0,\r\n                _xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldInitSpec_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"default\"])(this, _throwIfUndefined, {\r\n                    writable: true,\r\n                    value: void 0\r\n                });\r\n                this.property = property;\r\n                (0,\r\n                _xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldSet_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__[\"default\"])(this, _throwIfUndefined, this.assertIfPropertyIsDefined());\r\n            }\r\n            assertIfPropertyIsDefined() {\r\n                if (!this.property) {\r\n                    throw new Error('the property should be defined');\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut using Typescript 5.0.4 the service is transpiled to:\r\n```ts\r\n\r\n        __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n        /* harmony export */\r\n        __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, {\r\n            /* harmony export */\r\n            \"IssueService\": ()=>(/* binding */\r\n            IssueService)/* harmony export */\r\n        });\r\n        /* harmony import */\r\n        var xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldInitSpec_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! ./node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/classPrivateFieldInitSpec.js */\r\n        4482);\r\n\r\n        var _throwIfUndefined = /*#__PURE__*/\r\n        new WeakMap();\r\n        class IssueService {\r\n            constructor(property) {\r\n                // The code is different and this code produces an exception where using 4.9.4 don't\r\n                (0,\r\n                _xxx_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classPrivateFieldInitSpec_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"default\"])(this, _throwIfUndefined, {\r\n                    writable: true,\r\n                    value: this.assertIfPropertyIsDefined()\r\n                });\r\n                this.property = property;\r\n            }\r\n            assertIfPropertyIsDefined() {\r\n                if (!this.property) {\r\n                    throw new Error('the property should be defined');\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the difference comes from the initialization of private fields. Well, I can't reproduce it on [typescript side](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?target=8&moduleResolution=99&module=7&importHelpers=true&downlevelIteration=true&noUncheckedIndexedAccess=true&noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature=true&experimentalDecorators=true&emitDecoratorMetadata=true&ts=5.0.4&useDefineForClassFields=true&jsx=0&allowArbitraryExtensions=true#code/KYDwDg9gTgLgBAYwDYEMDOa4EkMFdhwDeAUHHAMRhQRjCwCecAvHDABYCWaAdF2vsVKIIAOzQwouBDGgAKKhwBuKGASjAUAE1FJGffAC44uEQGsREAO4iAlETgBfYg6A)\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a babel issue, but I don't know how to check it and I haven't found any issue about it...\r\n\r\nI've prepared a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/tonivj5/angular-ts-5-transpilation-issue):\r\n- this commit works: https://github.com/tonivj5/angular-ts-5-transpilation-issue/commit/8b995e3ce123273cb6cde8a778964a61f5939d51 (ts 4.9.4, good transpilation)\r\n- this commit doesn't work: https://github.com/tonivj5/angular-ts-5-transpilation-issue/commit/6cd80130b998ecf39c58d3a6698108e7de77798b (ts 5.0.4, bad transpilation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tonivj5/angular-ts-5-transpilation-issue\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nUcaught Error: the property should be defined\r\n    at IssueService.assertIfPropertyIsDefined (issue.service.ts:8:13)\r\n    at new IssueService (issue.service.ts:2:28)\r\n    at 6747 (app.module.ts:13:17)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:19:1)\r\n    at 4431 (issue.service.ts:10:3)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:19:1)\r\n    at __webpack_exec__ (main.ts:7:36)\r\n    at main.ts:7:36\r\n    at __webpack_require__.O (chunk loaded:23:1)\r\n    at main.ts:7:36\r\na\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNode.js version v19.4.0 detected.\r\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

There is no clean way to do this (that I know of) if `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is enabled. (Setting the property to the empty string is not equivalent, as that will still result in a spurious `#` character being added to the href.) The below reproducer demonstrates this particular problem.\r\n\r\nThe only way out of this is to work around the type system by [coercing the value to non-null](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#non-null-assertion-operator-postfix-):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<child-component [someProperty]=\"someValue!\"></child-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut note that [this is still not quite correct](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14967535/delete-a-x-vs-a-x-undefined), as it results in the property being set to `undefined`, as opposed to being unset (in the `delete` operator sense) - and in fact this is precisely the mistake `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is designed to prevent. Fortunately most child components won't care as they typically don't make the distinction between an absent property and one that is set to `undefined`.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-router-fragment-uo79rv\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: src/app/app.component.html:12:23 - error TS2412: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'.

One comment [#16779 comment ](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16779#issuecomment-579183693) stated it was not meant for files outside of bundles.  If I'm not mistaken, styles are part of the bundle.\r\n\r\nThe problem: I'm using a styles package that I don't have control over.  It has a less variable for setting the base-href path for the assets.  \r\n- When I serve it up at `/`, everything is fine\r\n- When I serve it up at  `/some-path` I have to update this less variable to /some-path/assets\r\n\r\nNow I have different configurations when I'm running the app locally and when I'm deploying it at /some-path on a server and angular fileReplacements doesn't support this scenario.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to be able to replace any file at the src root level for different configurations.  This would allow me to have:\r\n\r\n- styles.base.less (all my imports and global styles)\r\n- styles.less (import styles.base.less and modify the less variable)\r\n- styles.local.less (import styles.base.less, no variable modification, use this to replace styles.less in local config)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n- Considered fileReplacement above ^\r\n- Considered putting a file in assets, but I believe .less is a preprocessor on css and it would only copy the file\r\n- Considered webpack.config.js but again it would just copy the file without doing the pre-processing\r\n- Considered running a script right before build.

Because of that, there's no way to disable the index generation:\r\n\r\n- If we set the option to `\"false\"` we get an error because it matches both the `string` and the const:\r\n\t```\r\n\tError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be object.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n    ```\r\n- If we set the option to `false` we get an error because it doesn't match any of the possible definitions:\r\n\t```\r\n\tError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be string.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be object.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be equal to constant.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n    ```\r\n- If we run the build with `ng build --no-index` (as one of the goals of the change https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/0d4a40fd6eea6e60f5fc17ddb4ff74e58086669d) we get the same as the previous error:\r\n    ```\r\n\tError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be string.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be object.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must be equal to constant.\r\n    Data path \"/index\" must match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\nThe `index` option of the `browser-esbuild` builder is defined to accept one of a `string`, and `object` or a const `false` (boolean).

However, if a custom browserslist is used that only has newer browsers than the static code elements may be present. This issue is compounded by the default usage of the tsconfig `\"useDefineForClassFields\": false` option present in generated CLI projects which causes static code blocks to be used instead of static fields. esbuild currently unconditionally downlevels all static fields in top-level classes so to workaround the Angular issue only static code blocks are disabled here.\r\n\r\nFixes #25127","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25132","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): workaround for esbuild static block AOT generated code\" (#25132)"},{"Id":"1695640352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-04T13:37:49","Actor":"npetillon","Number":"25129","RawContent":null,"Title":"browser-esbuild less-plugin - ","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI tested the esbuild and encountered 2 problems on the less compilation:\r\n- in [less-plugin](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/browser-esbuild/stylesheets/less-plugin.ts):\r\n  - we have a stack overflow error with the first attempt to direct loading as a relative path: \r\n  ```typescript\r\n          // Attempt direct loading as a relative path to avoid resolution overhead\r\n          const directResult = this.loadFileSync(filename, currentDirectory, options, environment);\r\n          // this.loadFileSync => he calls himself\r\n  ```\r\n  - the file resolution doesn't work as expected and all paths configured on `stylePreprocessorOptions` are not used\r\n\r\nJust for my tests and to workaround, I just remove the override function `` to use the original less [FileManager](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/packages/less/src/less-node/file-manager.js).\r\n\r\n- always in [less-plugin](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/browser-esbuild/stylesheets/less-plugin.ts) the javascriptEnabled options is not enabled so we've got some errors\r\n\r\nTo workaround this I added the options javascriptEnabled to less.render:\r\n```typescript\r\nless.render(data, {\r\n      filename,\r\n      paths: options.includePaths,\r\n      plugins: [resolverPlugin],\r\n      rewriteUrls: 'all',\r\n      javascriptEnabled: true,\r\n      sourceMap: options.sourcemap\r\n        ?

Without `multiple` attribute screen reader announces the \"selected/not selected\" state as expected.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open basic example from the Chips doc:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10143921/236651172-75b9d303-f1ca-4fe8-90c7-2d975d14d0af.png)\r\n\r\n2. Add `multiple` attribute to `mat-chip-listbox` to allow multiselect.\r\n```\r\n<mat-chip-listbox multiple aria-label=\"Fish selection\">\r\n  <mat-chip-option>One fish</mat-chip-option>\r\n  <mat-chip-option>Two fish</mat-chip-option>\r\n  <mat-chip-option color=\"accent\" selected>Accent fish</mat-chip-option>\r\n  <mat-chip-option color=\"warn\">Warn fish</mat-chip-option>\r\n</mat-chip-listbox>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Turn on a screen reader and navigate between chip options.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen multiselect enabled, when clicking/tabing on a chip, screen reader announces:\r\n\r\n- (when option selected) \"{label} selected\"\r\n- (when option not selected) \"{label} not selected\"\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen multiselect enabled, when clicking/tabing on a chip, screen reader announces:\r\n\r\nOn MacOS + VoiceOver:\r\n- (when option selected) \"{label} selected, selected\"\r\n- (when option not selected) \"{label} not selected, selected\"\r\n\r\nOn Linux + Orca:\r\n- (when option selected) \"{label}\"\r\n- (when option not selected) \"{label} not selected\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10143921/236651100-b67ed0d2-d84e-47d9-9df3-387fabefb302.png)\n\n### Environment\n\nNot a custom env, able to reproduce in basic example on StackBlitz in Chrome:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10143921/236651165-6bb42b01-1e5a-4638-b893-a23c3542ed59.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27053","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Chips): Screen reader does not announce proper selected state when multiselect enabled\" (#27053)"},{"Id":"1698608240","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T12:23:04","Actor":"vitaly-t","Number":"27052","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatTable): Jumpy MatPager when inside expandable MatTable","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWith your [examples section](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples), there are demos for using expandable `MatTable`, with the help of `ngTemplateOutlet`, and there are demos for using `MatPager`. But there isn't a single example of using both. And if there were, you would see that when combining expandable `MatTable` with `MatPager`, it no longer looks well.\r\n\r\nWhat happens - every time we expand a panel, all panels that are below + the pager show an animation artifact whereby the whole thing jumps lower first, and then it jumps back up, which doesn't look well. Just as we remove `MatPager` from expandable `MatTable`, that artifact disappears.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nTake any of the [existing examples](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples) of expandable `MatTable` (with template), and add `MatPager` into such demo, you will get the undesired effect of jumpy animation upon expansion.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen adding `MatPager` into expandable `MatTable`, the latter must continue animating as before.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnce `MatPager` is added into expandable `MatTable`, expansion of any item results in a jump of all items below + the pager.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.2.9\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.9\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 112\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27052","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTable): Jumpy MatPager when inside expandable MatTable\" (#27052)"},{"Id":"1698544363","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T09:51:52","Actor":"moniuch","Number":"27051","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(TREE): Better examples","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThe examples of Flat and nested tree don't really show the difference between them, the examples look functionally identical and interchangeable.\r\nUser needs better examples which show the reason why there are two types of tree controls.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27051","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(TREE): Better examples\" (#27051)"},{"Id":"1698508910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T07:06:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27050","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): ensure prefix and suffix are on top of other content","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the prefix and suffix sometimes might not be clickable because they're underneath the label.\r\n\r\nFixes #27043.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27050","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/form-field): ensure prefix and suffix are on top of other content\" (#27050)"},{"Id":"1698345568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T00:55:31","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"27049","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(checkbox, radio): Provide a way to vertically align checkboxes and radios in stacked layouts","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nMDC increased checkbox and radio touch areas.

We could write for every component checks if the object will be present onInit if its null etc. From my personall experience this leads to bigger and less maintainable code structure.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI suggest angulars takes a look to add either a new pipe @Required - which I have an example for, or extend the existing one @Input to additionally provide a object with meta data if its required, what value are allowed etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@RequiredInputs()\r\n@Component({\r\n...\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n   readonly data$ = new ReplaySubject<string[] | undefined>();\r\n\r\n  @Input() @Required() set data(data: string[] | undefined) { // By default undefined, null and NaN are forbidden.

If an object is passed inside the object can be the proper input identifier and if inside that object there is no identifier it would (as currently) use the property name. If there isn't any value passed or a string is passed (as now) it would fall back to the current behavior - that way nothing would break.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46949","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Required @Input()\" (#46949)"},{"Id":"1315518781","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-23T01:15:02","Actor":"muhamedkarajic","Number":"46948","RawContent":null,"Title":"await / async (props) of Observables | Promises etc","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAngular allows us to use async pipe but when using multiple streams there isn't really a great way to ngIf them. \r\n\r\nImagine the scenario I have observables a$ and b$ and I want to wait for both of them. Of course I could make another observable in my TS file and combineLatest them but this means I would need to that for every scenario in my HTML and it dosent make much sence to combine them in the TS if all I want is to display a loading animation.\r\n\r\nI went trough a few possible solutions and think this could be a standard Angular feature. I'm open for discussions and suggestions but as far as the testing / working of the idea goes it seems to work fine. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI propose we have a similar async pipe but it would work only for keys of observables, this way you can keep your HTML clean and robust. The following code will recreate an object based on the current one but with the catch that it will map all observables to another object with the returned values from the stream.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"{ myData$, selectedItems$, myPromise$ } | await as props; else loading\">\r\n  <my-multi-selector\r\n    [selectedItems]=\"props.selectedItems$.value\"\r\n    [data]=\"props.myData$.value\"></my-multi-selector>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-template #loading>\r\n  <div>Loading...</div>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRegarding the implementation I made a sample app which I tested and it seems to work fine. There is a catch to my code and that is that I catch the object and compare references - this is completely fine if you use the code as above written but there is an issue if you e.g. create your object in TS and then dynamically change the keys (adding / removing keys will cause issues without creating a new instance of the object itself).\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by removing the comparison of the references of the new and old object but since this isn't a pure pipe I considered the performance impact and since this would be used only in HTML anyway I think this is the best possible solution - again I'm open for discussion.\r\n\r\nLink of example: https://github.com/muhamedkarajic/angular-playground/blob/main/src/app/shared/pipes/await.pipe.ts","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46948","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"await / async (props) of Observables | Promises etc\" (#46948)"},{"Id":"1315449400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-22T22:04:31","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"46947","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update io_bazel_rules_sass digest to 030f696","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| io_bazel_rules_sass | http_archive | digest | `eda73f6` -> `030f696` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

leading or trailing combinators, or with multiple\n    combinators in a row. If they're included in style rules after nesting is\n    resolved, Sass will now produce a deprecation warning and, in most cases, omit\n    the selector. Leading and trailing combinators can still be freely used for\n    nesting purposes.\n\n    See https://sass-lang.com/d/bogus-combinators for more details.\n\n-   Add partial support for new media query syntax from Media Queries Level 4. The\n    only exception are logical operations nested within parentheses, as these were\n    previously interpreted differently as SassScript expressions.\n\n    A parenthesized media condition that begins with `not` or an opening\n    parenthesis now produces a deprecation warning. In a future release, these\n    will be interpreted as plain CSS instead.\n\n-   Deprecate passing non-`deg` units to `color.hwb()`'s `$hue` argument.\n\n-   Fix a number of bugs when determining whether selectors with pseudo-elements\n    are superselectors.\n\n-   Treat `*` as a superselector of all selectors.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add a top-level `fakeFromImport()` function for testing custom importers\n    that use `AsyncImporter.fromImport`.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Add a `charset` option that controls whether or not Sass emits a\n    `@charset`/BOM for non-ASCII stylesheets.\n\n-   Fix Sass npm package types for TS 4.7+ Node16 and NodeNext module resolution.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The focus behavior of the `span` is slightly different from the button we had before.\r\n2. The focus restoration after an edit is finished is currently working by accident. When editing starts, we set `isInteractive = false` on the primary action which clears its `tabindex`. When editing is finished, we reset the flag, but change detection hasn't had the chance to run so the element won't actually have a `tabindex` at the moment when we try to restore focus. It worked by accident because a `button` is still focusable even without a `tabindex`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach I was testing out was to swap between a `span` and `button` element based on the `editable` input, but that didn't work, because we have a `ViewChild` query for the primary action which wasn't being updated by the framework.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25327","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-chips): don't use button element if chip row isn't editable\" (#25327)"},{"Id":"1314155663","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-22T03:54:25","Actor":"mleibman","Number":"25326","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material-experimental/mdc-chips): Fix runaway change detections","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #25325 by reducing the overhead of having multiple instances of the component by ignoring calls to `setDescribedByIds()` where the value does not change, and using macroTasks (promise) instead of macroTasks (setTimeout) to schedule work to be done in the next change detection cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the example demonstrated in #25325, this PR improves performance by over **60%**.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1025\" alt=\"52fnPoLhetQ2dyk\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168725/180358924-f36afe98-c7cf-46e8-bd4f-625081214f18.png\">\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"930\" alt=\"5WJ87evzPtjeSsx\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168725/180358982-563f301b-c044-4e7a-875a-4995f39b225d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25326","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(material-experimental/mdc-chips): Fix runaway change detections\" (#25326)"},{"Id":"1314139815","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-22T03:44:05","Actor":"mleibman","Number":"25325","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material-experimental/mdc-chips): Poor performance when using multiple `<mat-chip-grid>` components","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere's a performance issue in `material-experimental`'s `<mat-chip-grid>`.\r\n\r\nWe have **69** instances of `<mat-chip-grid>` on one of our pages, and `setDescribedByIds()` seems to be getting called **4** times per instance.

As part of the 14.0 update, these individual component-level files were removed.  Instead, the top level `package.json` exposes path resolutions for each version of each component via a series of `exports` entries.  As a result, any consumer that does not understand or respect the `exports` field in the top level `package.json` becomes incompatible with this library.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nClone [this repro](https://github.com/thw0rted/issue-examples/tree/angular-webpack-material) and execute `npm run start`.  The build should be successful.\r\n\r\nClone [the same thing updated to v14](https://github.com/thw0rted/issue-examples/tree/angular-webpack-material-v14) of Angular and Material, and run the same command.  You will see:\r\n\r\n> ERROR in ./src/app/app.module.ts 29:17-52\r\n> Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n> resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n\r\nNote that the Webpack config uses `resolve.exportsFields: []` to ignore the `exports` field.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that do not understand the `exports` field should still be able to use the library.\r\n\r\n(If the files are not restored, and `exports`-field support is required going forward, this is a breaking change and should be documented as such in the change log, dating back to 14.0.0.)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that don't understand, or intentionally ignore, the `exports` field can no longer use the library.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the `exports` field is the recommended solution suggested by Webpack, when using a library that fails to explicitly export a resource you need to consume.  I am stuck with such a library, I've had an open issue with them to fix it for over a year and I'm not happy about it, but there is literally nothing else I can do.  Still, this is the first time I've run into a library that does not work at all when the `exports` field is ignored / unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.0.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.5\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Win10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(package): Unannounced breaking change: new package structure requires `exports` field support\" (#25305)"},{"Id":"1309192766","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T14:10:04","Actor":"alkavats1","Number":"25304","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet ","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25304","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet \" (#25304)"},{"Id":"1309099809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T10:17:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25301","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events","State":"closed","Body":"Adds checks to ensure that `touchmove` and `touchend` events are cancelable before we call `preventDefault` on them.\r\n\r\nFixes #25272.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25301","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events\" (#25301)"},{"Id":"1309148659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T08:25:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25303","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots","State":"closed","Body":"The snapshots were failing, because the MDC migration tests were targeting es2016, but the CLI introduced some es2020 syntax.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25303","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots\" (#25303)"},{"Id":"1309106031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T07:47:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25302","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/snack-bar): fix out-of-sync code","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes some code that is out of sync with the code we have internally.

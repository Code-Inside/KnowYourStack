-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 8.x.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nConsider following situation:\r\n\r\n- there is an AngularJS application\r\n- follow [official upgrade guide](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade#upgrading-with-ngupgrade) to get it into hybrid mode with `ngUpgrade`\r\n- start writing all new components in new Angular (to not to add more legacy code) and where needed - use `downgradeComponent` to be able to use Angular components in AngularJS\r\n- if downgraded component is used _only_ in AngularJS templates - it will be shaken off the tree with production build - this manifests itself in component just not being rendered. Silently. No errors, warnings, or whatsoever.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nIt can be fixed with referencing the component somewhere, as suggested in related issues - https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35314#issuecomment-584821399, or in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16246#issuecomment-557051190\r\n\r\nFix commit: https://github.com/zuzusik/angular-upgrade-ivy-bug/commit/f123b6bcb680231f823d9260c29b9a79cd6d4c2f\r\n\r\n#### Things to fix/improve\r\n\r\nThere are several things about this which don't look right:\r\n\r\n- this is huge regression for applications using `ngUpgrade` - _ideally_ this should be fixed\r\n- it all happens silently - no errors/warnings/logs or whatsoever - _at least_ it should give some clues about it \r\n- it's discrepancy between prod and dev build - in dev build all still works great - _ideally_\r\n these 2 builds should not have such huge discrepancies\r\n- official upgrade guide says to include component into `entryComponents` which has no effect in Ivy - _at least_ it should have some notes about compatibility with Ivy and possible shake off of the downgraded components\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n* clone https://github.com/zuzusik/angular-upgrade-ivy-bug\r\n* run `ng serve`\r\n* observe all components rendered\r\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\r\n* observe `<downgraded-component>` not being rendered\r\n* expected - `<downgraded-component>` is rendered\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nNo exceptions or errors or whatsoever - and this is very frustrating.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.5\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.5\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

not relate code already . if you run `ng serve` and go to `/2/report/financial/profit-and-loss` it works. but if you go to `/2/report/financial/health-index` it will throw error. \r\n\r\nif you try to copy all code from `FinancialBaseComponent` to `FinancialBusinessHealthComponent` and remove `extends FinancialBaseComponent` it works too.\r\n\r\nand if you create new project and copy `src/app` to

The plugin is based on the design introduced by `tsc_wrapped` within Bazel‚Äôs `rules_typescript` and leverages the newly added ngtsc plugin from within the `@angular/compiler-cli` package.  By leveraging the same plugin interface that is used by Bazel, a common interface can be used to access the Angular compiler.  This has benefits to both major build systems and dramatically reduces the necessary code infrastructure to integrate the Angular compiler.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plugin simplifies and reduces the amount of code within the plugin by leveraging newer TypeScript features and capabilities.  The need for the virtual filesystem has also been removed.  The file replacements capability was the primary driver for the previous need for the virtual filesystem.  File replacements are now implemented using a two-pronged approach.  The first, for TypeScript, is to hook TypeScript module resolution and adjust the resolved modules based on the configured file replacements.  This is similar in behavior to TypeScript path mapping.  The second, for Webpack, is the use of the `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to facilitate bundling of the configured file replacements.  An advantage to this approach is that the build system (both TypeScript and Webpack) are now aware of the replacements and can operate without augmenting multiple aspects of system as was needed previously.\r\n\r\nThe plugin also introduces the use of TypeScript‚Äôs builder programs.  The current primary benefit is more accurate and simplified dependency discovery.  Further, they also provide for the potential future introduction of incremental build support and incremental type checking.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The deprecated string format for lazy routes is not supported by this plugin.  Dynamic imports are recommended for use with Ivy and are required when using the new plugin.\r\n\r\nPerformance and memory usage have also been improved with these changes.  Initial benchmarking indicates an average ~10% reduction in production build time and a similar ~10% reduction in peak memory usage.  The plugin is also not yet fully optimized.  The next phase of development will introduce performance tracing and support further improvements.  Watch mode is currently slower than the previous plugin and will be further optimized and improved once the performance tracing support is introduced.  Also, parallel type checking is currently not yet integrated which was a primary reason for the previous plugin‚Äôs watch mode performance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17717","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ivy-only Webpack ngtsc Plugin\" (#17717)"},{"Id":"617557035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T15:44:46","Actor":"alyahmedaly","Number":"17714","RawContent":null,"Title":"calling custom schematics that uses filter rule throws Error: A merge conflicted on path \"/angular.json\"","State":"open","Body":"We have a schematic which call's another 2 schematics using `externalSchematic` like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n    externalSchematic('@blabla/schematics-app', 'app', options),\r\n    externalSchematic('@blabla/schematics-widget', 'widget',options),\r\n```\r\n\r\nand both schematics app and widget updating same file, but the implementation of the widget one has\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { filter } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\n...\r\nexport const widgetRule = (host)=>{return filter(path=>path !== \"blabla\")}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe problem is when schematics try to merge the tree back it has this condition\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6e03adb9e2f161a9ba9f8826537bd13047981e79/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/tree/host-tree.ts#L166\r\n\r\nwhich check if the tree instance of HostTree and not consider FilteredHost tree\r\nnot sure the fix will to make filter return a Tree or to handle FilteredHost tree in this check\r\n\r\nhere is my versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: undefined\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics-cli    0.800.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.0\r\n@angular/compiler                 8.0.0\r\n@angular/compiler-cli             8.0.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema              1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0\r\n@schematics/schematics            0.800.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.0\r\nng-packagr                        5.2.0\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"calling custom schematics that uses filter rule throws Error: A merge conflicted on path \"/angular.json\"\" (#17714)"},{"Id":"617508896","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T15:23:07","Actor":"Heerschop","Number":"17713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added buildOptimizer option for the ng serve command","State":"closed","Body":"Added the `--build-optimizer` option to the `ng serve` command. \r\n\r\nWith this change you can use `ng serve` in a production configuration without optimization enabled, which is a lot faster.

The problem is that the TypeScript compiler API intends to\r\nrely fully on absolute paths, while ng-update and the devkit tree intend\r\nto rely on project-scoped/relative paths.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic as it is straightforward to mix paths up, leading to\r\nunexpected errors. For example, computing a relative path between a devkit\r\npath and an absolute disk path results in a non-existent path.\r\n\r\nTo fix this ambiguity, we improve type safety of paths by using branded\r\nprimitives such as the `@angular-devkit/core` `Path` or an even more\r\nstrict type called `WorkspacePath`. A normal string is considered an\r\nunresolved path and cannot be assigned to a `WorkspacePath`. Similarly a\r\n`WorkspacePath` cannot be assigned to a `string`. This ensures that\r\nresolved paths are not accidentally mixed with unresolved paths, and\r\nthat we can safely pass around unresolved and resolved paths without\r\nloss of their semantics.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a case (and potentially more) where a devkit path and an absolute disk\r\npath result in an incorrectly resolved resource. In CLI apps it's possible to reference\r\nresources through absolute project-scoped paths. e.g. `/src/app/app.component.html`. This has been fixed, and tests have been added (this might be the fix for #19354)\r\n\r\n**Note**: Long-term it would be ideal to implement a TypeScript compiler host that only deals with resolved workspace paths, but this is not possible yet as implementing TypeScript's `readDirectory` host method with a virtual tree is complex (and TS doesn't expose its helpers here).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19354","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: ensure paths are safely passed around in ng-update\" (#19354)"},{"Id":"618299749","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-14T15:15:01","Actor":"devversion","Number":"19353","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(mdc-form-field): disambiguate mixin names from non-mdc form-field","State":"closed","Body":"Mixins like `_mat-form-field-density` also exist in the non-mdc\r\nform-field implementation.

Shouldn't it be the case since I have disabled autofocus?\r\n\r\nthanks","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19350","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modals : Clicking on the backdrop automatically focuses on the first field\" (#19350)"},{"Id":"617954399","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-14T06:15:23","Actor":"Harshitha-7","Number":"19349","RawContent":null,"Title":"I want to fix tool bar like angular material nav bar.

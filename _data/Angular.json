So no matter what you enter in the input field, you will always get the same result from the server, but the input field does not reflect those results.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe input field is initialized with *****, then a user overwrites the password with 'secret password', the server returns ***** but the form field does not reflect this change.

Several strategies were used to effect this refactoring:\r\n\r\n * The interfaces of the main abstractions are interdependent, and are split out into a separate `model/api.ts` file.\r\n * Each interface is implemented by a private implementation class.\r\n * Constructors for each abstraction are defined with a separate constructor signature, and a `const` constructor declaration which is merged with\r\n   the interface type.\r\n * The `_find` operation, which previously depended on `instanceof` checks with the actual constructor types to achieve different behavior for different types of controls, has been refactored to rely on an internal method on the `AbstractControl` hierarchy instead.\r\n\r\nTogether, these changes will make the forms package much more maintainable, and pave the way for type-specific changes needed to strongly type the forms abstractions.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR was originally drafted by @alxhub, but I am shepherding it through review, since it will prepare typed forms for an easier API review.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: alxhub","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45168","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): split apart `model.ts`\" (#45168)"},{"Id":"1147450279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T22:55:36","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"45167","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add ariaCurrentWhenActive input to RouterLinkActive directive","State":"open","Body":"add the ariaCurrentWhenActive input to the RouterLinkActive directive so that\r\nusers can easily set the aria-current property to their active router\r\nlinks\r\n\r\nresolves #35051\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

With the latest release of all packages, Angular 13, eslint 8.9.0, angular-eslint 13.1.0 and typescript-eslint 5.11.0, our project takes around 40 minutes 😱 to lint, which of course makes it impossible to integrate into any CI workflow. The experience is much better on individual files within vscode.\r\n\r\nI've read all the articles about improving the performance, and I tried some solutions without any result, but really, this is a tool that's supposed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration, we can't spend so much time trying to get it right, especially when tslint just worked.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I noticed that even the Angular and Angular Material teams haven't switched to eslint yet, you're both still on tslint. In fact, I couldn't find any Angular project of considerable size on github that has switched to eslint. Granted, I didn't expect to find any, because I guess Angular is used mostly in corporate environments, intranet applications and so on, so it's difficult to find code hosted on public repos.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSo, perhaps we should revisit the decision to drop tslint or suggest a better alternative? I don't have a suggestion of course, just pointing out the obvious issues.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to hear from people working on big Angular projects, especially with monorepo structures, multiple projects and libraries inside.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\neslint with angular-eslint.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tslint replacement\" (#45153)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1148223369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-24T01:03:36","Actor":"elycheikhsmail","Number":"22754","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-deno cli experimental","State":"closed","Body":"I hope ng cli be write ts-deno-first, the finale user don't care about it was writen but this make ng cli dev and maintenace more easier I think but sure this will in progressif way.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22754","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng-deno cli experimental\" (#22754)"},{"Id":"1148692286","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-23T23:31:51","Actor":"samherrmann","Number":"22764","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/schematics glossary is missing Task","State":"open","Body":"The [Schematics Glossary](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics#glossary) doesn't introduce what a `Task` is, making it difficult for new schematic developers to know what `Task`s should be used for and how they work.\r\n\r\nThe _Schematics for libraries_ page on angular.io [demonstrates an example for adding a task](https://angular.io/guide/schematics-for-libraries#providing-installation-support), but it also doesn't provide an explanation on what a `Task` is.

Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v5.12.0...v5.12.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **eslint-plugin:** \\[no-unnecessary-type-arguments] fix comparison of types ([#&#8203;4555](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/4555)) ([fc3936e](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/commit/fc3936e99712374a707ce9e0101bc641807b9ea6))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint

[`v5.12.1`](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/HEAD/packages/parser/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;5121-httpsgithubcomtypescript-eslinttypescript-eslintcomparev5120v5121-2022-02-21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v5.12.0...v5.12.1)\n\n**Note:** Version bump only for package [@&#8203;typescript-eslint/parser](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/parser)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.23`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01423)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.22...v0.14.23)\n\n-   Update feature database to indicate that node 16.14+ supports import assertions ([#&#8203;2030](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2030))\n\n    Node versions 16.14 and above now support import assertions according to [these release notes](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/blob/6db686710ee1579452b2908a7a41b91cb729b944/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V16.md#&#8203;16.14.0). This release updates esbuild's internal feature compatibility database with this information, so esbuild no longer strips import assertions with `--target=node16.14`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from './package.json' assert { type: 'json' }\n    console.log(data)\n\n    // Old output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\";\n    console.log(data);\n\n    // New output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\" assert { type: \"json\" };\n    console.log(data);\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for CSS `@layer` rules ([#&#8203;2027](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2027))\n\n    This adds basic parsing support for a new CSS feature called `@layer` that changes how the CSS cascade works. Adding parsing support for this rule to esbuild means esbuild can now minify the contents of `@layer` rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        div {\n          color: yellow;\n          margin: 0.0px;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a{@&#8203;layer b {div {color: yellow; margin: 0px;}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b{div{color:#ff0;margin:0}}\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about `@layer` here:\n\n    -   Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/[@&#8203;layer](https://togithub.com/layer)\n    -   Motivation: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/cascade-layers/\n\n    Note that the support added in this release is only for parsing and printing `@layer` rules. The bundler does not yet know about these rules and bundling with `@layer` may result in behavior changes since these new rules have unusual ordering constraints that behave differently than all other CSS rules. Specifically the order is derived from the *first* instance while with every other CSS rule, the order is derived from the *last* instance.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-840-2022-02-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.3.0...v8.4.0)\n\n-   Added: \\[vue/quote-props].

Try to access element by name attribute, such as in tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIf name attribute is directly set, then Angular Material Input needs to set name attribute more carefully.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAngular Material Input overrides name attribute directly set by user of mat-input.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24463","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/input): name property setting overrides developer defined name property\" (#24463)"},{"Id":"1146887211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T13:04:48","Actor":"davidglezz","Number":"24461","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark","State":"open","Body":"It seems that it was accidentally added in the first version of the component. unneeded attribute xml:space is removed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24461","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/checkbox): remove xml:space attr from svg checkmark\" (#24461)"},{"Id":"1146085479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T20:49:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24459","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a regression caused by #19505 where clicking directly on the `input` element will prevent the click from reaching custom `click` listeners outside the radio button.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/radio): clicks not propagating to wrapper elements\" (#24459)"},{"Id":"1143303340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T16:40:54","Actor":"danitag78","Number":"24447","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(all components): Material You/3","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nHi, I tried to use @angular/material-experimental thinking it was ready to Material You, but I see that it is not.

I'm using Zone.js in production code to track async context variables, and we'll be in a bind if we lose this ability.\r\n\r\nCan we push to get Zone.js standardized again, or at least something that would allow us to save state in the async execution context?\r\n\r\n# Backstory\r\n\r\nIn our organization, we have a concept called \"Flows\". It's similar to ngrx actions, but they are more like a function with a declared return type. I tell new employees they can think about it like a C header file, that gets linked at runtime; It uses the Angular dependency injector under the hood to abstract away a lot of configuration snafus.\r\n\r\nWe use flows for a lot of things, including navigation between sections of our app. A real world example is the \"Go To Dashboard\" function - each user depending on their individual attributes might have a different dashboard. This is complicated further by our large list of clients. Each of our clients can reconfigure their instance to change what \"Dashboard\" means for their organization. Sometimes, these dashboards are a 3rd URL that is _not_ controlled by Angular, or at least not the same Angular app.\r\n\r\nUsing a \"flow\", we can easily abstract away the implementation details of figuring out _which_ dashboard should be rendered, and how to get there. All navigation links can then just invoke the flow, eventually navigating the user.\r\n\r\nWhile this can be invoked with a (click) callback, I like anchor tags, and would like to use these same flows to determine a static href, not just navigate. Simple enough; I can just flip the switch on the navigation engine we use to \"record\" rather than actually navigate there.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes down to `async`. Because the same flow could be triggered programmatically (in which case we want to actually navigate there) at the same time the href determination service is running, I need a way to know the execution context at the time the function is executing.\r\n\r\nZone.js works great for this! Since I can just fork the zone before executing, I can know whether or not the current callback should be _executing_ or _recording_. I use WeakMaps to track settings per zone, using Zone.current to look up the appropriate behavior inside the callback.\r\n\r\n## My probelm\r\n\r\nIf Angular moves to a Zoneless future (because of native async / await), I will lose a major part of my capabilities, and have to maintain two separate execution paths for href links, vs button links.\r\n\r\nAre there any other ways to resolve this, without Zone.js? How can we track async execution context without it?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI could live without Zone.js but it would require two separate codepaths any time you needed something you could previously sandbox with Zone.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI don't think we have any alternatives unless async context tracking is standardized.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48454","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Zone.js standardization track push\" (#48454)"},{"Id":"1492652302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-12T20:02:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"48460","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/checkout digest to 7dd9e2a","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/checkout](https://togithub.com/actions/checkout) | action | digest | `93ea575` -> `7dd9e2a` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## The refactoring\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the commit I felt like the shadow css specs could use a bit of a clean up so I went for it (I hope you'll find the refactoring beneficial :slightly_smiling_face: )\r\n\r\nTo break down the points I made in the commit:\r\n\r\n> - refactor the tests so that they are nicely divided in multiple files in a logical manner instead of having most of them all in a single big file\r\n\r\nas you can see the [shadow_css_spec.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/shadow_css_spec.ts) file is 586 lines long and I believe that splitting it up can help in making things more clear and convenient.\r\n\r\n> - remove the css normalization logic inconsistently used throughout the tests, which causes tests to be inconsistent and it also introduced unintuitive checks\r\n\r\nregarding the normalization I wanted to remove it because it was making things quite inconsistent and confusing I believe, some tests were relying on it and some didn't and the name \"normalization\" and why it is necessary just felt very unintuitive to me, for example this is one of the effect it caused:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/shadow_css_spec.ts#L176\r\nas you can see in the expected value the `b` is wrapped by double quotes, that doesn't come from the shim itself but from the extra normalization added on top of it... I think this just makes thing less clear and I am not sure what the benefit of it is (I may be wrong, please correct me if I am :slightly_smiling_face:)\r\n\r\n> - provide a shared shim utility function (instead of re-defining it multiple times)\r\n\r\nas you can see in the three existing spec files we are more or less re-creating the same function:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/container_queries_spec.ts#L12-L15\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/keyframes_spec.ts#L12-L15\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/shadow_css_spec.ts#L14-L18\r\n\r\n> - add a `toCssEqual` matcher that can be used in the tests in order to match css strings without caring about spacing and indentation\r\n\r\nwith this we can avoid that confusing normalization logic and also not having to rely on the [noIndentation](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b5bb4c17d02cc226343487476f065c0f6535edae/packages/compiler/test/shadow_css/container_queries_spec.ts#L53-L55) utility function. doing `expect(...).toCssEqual` feels much cleaner to me.\r\n\r\n(By the way, in the PR I mostly moved tests around, I just simply added/removed utilities around that as well, no tests have been removed or added)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48443","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): refactor the shadow css specs\" (#48443)"},{"Id":"1489262243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-11T01:51:03","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48438","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove IE11 only sanitization code","State":"open","Body":"As IE11 support has been drop with v13, this specific code isn't needed anymore.\r\n\r\nSince older Safari versions do not support parsing HTML with `DOMParser`, I choose to keep that function for the time being. \r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48438","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): remove IE11 only sanitization code\" (#48438)"},{"Id":"1489197004","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-11T00:47:25","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"48437","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8bfc7e1` -> `26d9ed4` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `0527812` -> `60dfbec` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `96fdaaa` -> `47f3420` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The modified\r\nalgorithm removes all the known performance clifs and has number of\r\ndesirable properties:\r\n- it is shorter and (arguably) easier to follow;\r\n- drops usage of existing differs thus limiting dependencies on other\r\npart of the code without increasing size of the directive;\r\n- doesn't degrade any other performance metrics.\r\n\r\n### algorithm notes\r\n\r\nThe NgClass directive uses the custom change detection algorithm for its inputs. The custom\r\n  algorithm is necessary since inputs are represented as complex object or arrays that need to be\r\n  deeply-compared.\r\n\r\n  This algorithm is perf-sensitive since NgClass is used very frequently and its poor performance\r\n  might negatively impact runtime performance of the entire change detection cycle. The design of\r\n  this algorithm is making sure that:\r\n  - there is no unnecessary DOM manipulation (CSS classes are added / removed from the DOM only when\r\n  needed), even if references to bound objects change;\r\n  - there is no memory allocation if nothing changes (even relatively modest memory allocation\r\n  during the change detection cycle can result in GC pauses for some of the CD cycles).\r\n\r\n  The algorithm works by iterating over the set of bound classes, staring with [class] binding and\r\n  then going over [ngClass] binding. For each CSS class name:\r\n  - check if it was seen before (this information is tracked in the state map) and if its value\r\n  changed;\r\n  - mark it as \"touched\" - names that are not marked are not present in the latest set of binding\r\n  and we can remove such class name from the internal data structures;\r\n\r\n  Please note that we track \"changed\" state in a particular way (by using % 2 counter): this is done\r\n  so 2 changes that cancel each other out (ex. `<[class]=\"'foo'\" [ngClass]=\"{foo: false}\"`) don't\r\n  result in any DOM manipulation.\r\n\r\n  After iteration over all the CSS class names we've got data structure with all the information\r\n  necessary to synchronize changes to the DOM - it is enough to iterate over the state map, flush\r\n  changes to the DOM and reset internal data structures so those are ready for the next change\r\n  detection cycle.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48433","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ng class perf one

By doing so, the fix caused the imported compiler-cli `GLOBAL_DEFS_FOR_TERSER_WITH_AOT` constant to take precedence which contains an `ngDevMode` value of false. To prevent this situation for development builds where a non-false `ngDevMode` is helpful to surface potential runtime problems, `GLOBAL_DEFS_FOR_TERSER_WITH_AOT` will no longer change the value of `ngDevMode`.

the `@esbuild/` scope for Deno ([#&#8203;2729](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2729))\n\n    Version 0.16.0 of esbuild moved esbuild's binary executables into npm packages under the `@esbuild/` scope, which accidentally broke the binary downloader script for Deno. This release fixes this script so it should now be possible to use esbuild version 0.16.4+ with Deno.\n\n### [`v0.16.3`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0163)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.2...v0.16.3)\n\n-   Fix a hang with the JS API in certain cases ([#&#8203;2727](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2727))\n\n    A change that was made in version 0.15.13 accidentally introduced a case when using esbuild's JS API could cause the node process to fail to exit. The change broke esbuild's watchdog timer, which detects if the parent process no longer exists and then automatically exits esbuild. This hang happened when you ran node as a child process with the `stderr` stream set to `pipe` instead of `inherit`, in the child process you call esbuild's JS API and pass `incremental: true` but do not call `dispose()` on the returned `rebuild` object, and then call `process.exit()`. In that case the parent node process was still waiting for the esbuild process that was created by the child node process to exit. The change made in version 0.15.13 was trying to avoid using Go's `sync.WaitGroup` API incorrectly because the API is not thread-safe.

You can download them here https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable. We use portable versions so that we can have multiple versions of the browser on the system and test several different versions by setting CHROME_BIN.\r\nI am trying to upgrade to angular 14, and I am running into an isssue that is only seen when using a portable version of a browser. When you run ng test, the tests run and when they are done, the browser stays open and the command never finishes. The command we are using is ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browser=chrome. This poses and issue in a CI system that waits for the command to finish.\r\nI am sure that this is just a small thing I am missing in the upgrade... If this was an intentional change, what is the preferred way to test across multiple versions of a browser? Multiple VMs?

Currently that configuration cannot be changed by the user, even if the user provides a webpack configuration in their karma config.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe user's webpack configuration is merged together with the generated configuration, using `webpack-merge`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThis was previously possible, but the commit 04f5dfe5e2fc97bcf0641f1d2f8edfc59dae57b2 replaced  `Object.assign(webpackConfig, config.webpack)` with a spread operator, which means that `webpackConfig` was not changed anymore.\r\n\r\nSince the generated configuration uses functions (and the user's configuration could as well), `webpack-merge` is used to merge the configurations. Since `webpack-merge` will throw an error when passing undefined values, the code first checks that a value to-be-merged exists.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24407","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow extending generated webpack config of karma builder\" (#24407)"},{"Id":"1485719138","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-09T01:12:46","Actor":"e-oz","Number":"24401","RawContent":null,"Title":"@types/node higher than 18.11.10 breaks import of storybook builder","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nother\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWith @types/node 18.11.10 @angular-devkit/architect can correctly import storybook builder.\r\nWith a higher version, it fails with the error you can see below.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIt's not actually that simple to create an environment with Storybook, I found it in a nx workspace.\r\nPlease try to create nx workspace and add Storybook (Cypress is not needed).\r\nI still hope that you can find enough information from the error.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nDirectory import '/Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@storybook/angular/dist/ts3.9/builders/start-storybook' is not supported resolving ES modules imported from /Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/node/node-modules-architect-host.js\r\n\r\n   Did you mean to import /Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@storybook/angular/dist/ts3.9/builders/start-storybook/index.js?\r\n\r\nError [ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT]: Directory import '/Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@storybook/angular/dist/ts3.9/builders/start-storybook' is not supported resolving ES modules imported from /Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@angular-devkit/architect/node/node-modules-architect-host.js\r\nDid you mean to import /Users/oz/repos/scs/npp-ui/node_modules/@storybook/angular/dist/ts3.9/builders/start-storybook/index.js?\r\n    at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:393:5)\r\n    at finalizeResolution (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:253:17)\r\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:879:10)\r\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:1087:11)\r\n    at nextResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:161:28)\r\n    at ESMLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:831:30)\r\n    at ESMLoader.getModuleJob (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:413:18)\r\n    at ESMLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:514:22)\r\n    at importModuleDynamically (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1151:29)\r\n    at importModuleDynamicallyWrapper (node:internal/vm/module:438:21)\r\n\r\n —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nNode : 19.2.0\r\n   OS   : darwin arm64\r\n   yarn : 1.22.17\r\n   \r\n   nx : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/angular : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/cypress : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/detox : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/devkit : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/esbuild : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/expo : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/express : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/jest : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/js : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/linter : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/nest : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/next : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/node : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-cloud : 15.0.2\r\n   @nrwl/nx-plugin : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react-native : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/rollup : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/schematics : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/storybook : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/web : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/webpack : 15.3.0\r\n   @nrwl/workspace : 15.3.0\r\n   typescript : 4.9.4\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Local workspace plugins:\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Community plugins:\r\n         @ngrx/component-store: 15.0.0\r\n         @ngrx/effects: 15.0.0\r\n         @ngrx/store: 15.0.0\r\n         @jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy: 5.0.0\r\n         @ngrx/eslint-plugin: 15.0.0\r\n         @storybook/angular: 6.5.14\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24401","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@types/node higher than 18.11.10 breaks import of storybook builder\" (#24401)"},{"Id":"1484512100","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-08T22:49:57","Actor":"jrdutton","Number":"24394","RawContent":null,"Title":"SCSS Debugging issue -

This obviously means that the legacy components are attempted to be rendered using the styles for the new MDC components which results in a broken UI.\r\n\r\nWith that being said I can't figure out how to incrementally migrate to the new MDC components. The legacy prebuilt theme styles are needed to have the legacy components working properly but in order to migrate one component to its MDC counterpart the styles for the MDC prebuilt theme have to be loaded and both themes can't be used at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Update an Angular 14 app to Angular 15 while keeping Angular Material 14. (works without issues as far as I can tell)\r\n`\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    **\"@angular/cdk\": \"^14.2.0\",**\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    **\"@angular/material\": \"^14.2.0\",**\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.5.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.12.0\"\r\n  },`\r\n2.

Open http://localhost:4200/homepage in Google Chrome (or Microsoft Edge)\n5. Open the chrome developer tools\n6. Open the \"Memory\" tab\n7. Take a heap snapshot\n8. Filter for \"andrew\", verify nothing is found\n9. Close the chrome developer tools\n10. Click \"Launch Standalone\"\n11. Click \"Close\" (it will navigate after a 2 second delay)\n12. Repeat steps 10 & 11 a few times\n13. Reopen the chrome developer tools\n14. Open the \"Memory\" tab\n15. Take a heap snapshot\n16. Filter for \"andrew\", notice that the DOM element has been orphaned and will not be Garbage Collected. \n\nFor larger components this ends up leaking over 50MB of RAM per navigation in our application.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/088b0baf-d795-410b-8766-efd829680f94)\n\nNow see that somehow the problem is different with a synchronous navigation:\n1. Reload the browser to clear the memory\n2. Open dev tools\n3. Click \"Launch Standalone\" again\n4. This time click \"Close Synchronously\"\n5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 a few times\n15. Take a heap snapshot\n16. Filter for \"andrew\", notice that only the last DOM element that was routed to is detached. So there is still a memory issue, but thankfully it does not grow every time we route.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586b16a5-2339-438e-8d32-9977eb49d55f)\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/arobinson/angular-router-leak\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nDetached / Leaked DOM elements and their components\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.1\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.9.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.2\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.3\n@angular/cli                    18.2.1\n@schematics/angular             19.0.3\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.2\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59238","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular router leaks components and their DOM Elements\" (#59238)"},{"Id":"2748539695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T18:59:42","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"59237","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.5 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59237","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.5 release\" (#59237)"},{"Id":"2748531344","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T18:57:22","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"59236","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.5\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59236","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.5\" with changelog.\" (#59236)"},{"Id":"2747830536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T17:37:25","Actor":"m-housni","Number":"59235","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in code example","State":"closed","Body":"``` diff\r\n@Component({\r\n/*...*/\r\n-  // Set the `disabled` property of the button based on the value of `isAccountDisabled`.\r\n+  // Set the `disabled` property of the button based on the value of `isValidUserId `.\r\n    template: `<button [disabled]=\"isValidUserId()\">Save changes</button>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class UserProfile {\r\n    isValidUserId = signal(false);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59235","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix typo in code example\" (#59235)"},{"Id":"2747171175","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T17:36:24","Actor":"sandythesand","Number":"59231","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update defer.md","State":"closed","Body":"There was an extra Z letter which I think not neccessary.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, the mechanism by which Angular does this does not seem to be able to detect that the base class is using signal inputs and the raw value is set in the base class.\n\nFor example if we do something like this - <component [context]=\"{ entity: 'job }\" />. We expect that in the base class this will be set into the input signal. However, we find this that context property is now just an object. { context: { entity: 'job' }} \n\nIt appears that the mechanism used to set the exposed inputs on components is not aware of signal inputs whilst the mechanism used for host directives is.\n\nIn my example I have included an simple inherited component and a component exposing inputs via host directives.\n\nKind Regards,\nTarek\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rrxvfhpf?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe error is form the example above.

This would make it easier to implement a \"check\" CI step that prevents making changes that should have been migrated\n\n\nHopefully, this should reduce the cognitive load for users.\n\nIt would be nice also to consider Nx compatibility. Right now, Nx does not have an \"optional\" migration concept so the `optional` flag is ignored.\nAs an additional input, here is how Nx handles migration opt-outs: https://nx.dev/recipes/tips-n-tricks/advanced-update\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nProvide a more intuitive command than `ng g @angular/core: --help` to list all available migration schematics.\nMaybe `ng update` could list them.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29178","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Streamlining the migration experience\" (#29178)"},{"Id":"2748804606","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T21:45:37","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"29176","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29176","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.6 release\" (#29176)"},{"Id":"2748777082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T21:43:52","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"29175","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.6\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29175","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.6\" with changelog.\" (#29175)"},{"Id":"2748488684","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-18T18:33:12","Actor":"AlvinChacko","Number":"29174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Avoid installing LMDB for systems that dont support","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nadd\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv15\n\n### Description\n\nIm trying to build an angular app on z/OS and it looks like @angular/build@18.2.12 uses lmdb.

I also have another repo (my-application) that depends on the library. For setting up a local development environment, I am using `npm link` to link `dist/lib-a` to the `my-application` repo, running `ng watch` in `lib-a` and `ng serve` in `my-application` when performing development. \n\nI knew that in order to make `ng serve` detect the code changes from the linked lib-a, I need to do following: \n- In angular.json, specify `architect.build.configurations.development.preserveSymlink: true`\n- In tsconfig.json, define the paths property (define prebundle.exclude: \"lib-a\" in angular.json is not helpful, cause it doesnt support glob pattern to match all of my library's sub-entries): \n```\n\"paths\": {\n      \"lib-a\": [\"./node_modules/lib-a\"],\n      \"lib-a/*\": [\"./node_modules/lib-a/*\"],\n    },\n```\n\nIn my-library (lib-a), I have these 2 sub-entry points, component-y and service-x. Basically the component-y depends on service-x to show some data that is getting from the token that injected in service-x. In my-application (app.config.ts), I will provide the value of the token. \n\nservice-x\n```\nexport const X_TOKEN = new InjectionToken('X_TOKEN');\n\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\nexport class ServiceX {\n    myXToken = inject(X_TOKEN);\n} \n\n```\n\ncomponent-y\n```\n@Component({\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n    selector: \"component-y\",\n    template: \"<p>lib-a-component works! {{ myServiceX.myXToken}}</p>\"\n})\nexport class ComponentY {\n    protected myServiceX = inject(ServiceX);\n} \n```\n\nIn my-application (app.config.ts)\n```\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }), \n    { provide: X_TOKEN, useValue: 'OTHER_VALUE'},\n    provideRouter(routes)\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### Actual Issue\nEverything is working fine when it is being built or serve in `my-library`. \n**_However, in `my-application`, the behavior is not working as I expected when running with `ng serve`._** \nIt produces following error when I navigate to the page that using the component-y: \n\n```\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(Environment Injector)[_ServiceX -> InjectionToken X_TOKEN -> InjectionToken X_TOKEN]: \n  NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken X_TOKEN!\n```\n\nObservations: \n- If I remove the paths property in tsconfig, the null injector error is not observed in the next following `ng serve`.\n- I also tested the built files that generated from ng build (development/production) in my-application with angular-http-server. Everything is working fine. \n- The above issue happens in Angular 18 as well. \n\n\n\n### Expected behavior:  \nRunning ng serve with npm link library should behave the same as running ng serve with library that installed using npm install.\nI suspect this is a bug because I cant reproduce this in the codes that generated in ng build (preserveSymlink is specified also). \n\n\n\n### Other Questions: \n1. Can we just define prebundle.exclude: [\"lib-a\"] instead of [\"lib-a/component-y\", \"lib-a/service-x\"] ? Currently, if there is any code changes done in the sub-entries, it wont detect as a change if we define as [\"lib-a\"]. As an alternative, I am doing it now in tsconfig instead.\n2. Is it valid to provide the X_TOKEN value in app.config, where the token will be injected in a root service (ServiceX)? I assume provide token in app.config is the same as providedIn: 'root' and it should not cause any race-condition issue that causes the root service not able to inject the token.\n\n\nThanks and appreciate your help on this.  \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n\nmy-library: \nhttps://github.com/kjteh/my-library-npm-link\n\nmy-application: \nhttps://github.com/kjteh/my-application-npm-link\n\nSteps: \n1.

The app-shell schematic is no longer compatible with Webpack-based builders.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/build-angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/build-angular)\n\n-   The `browserTarget` option has been removed from the DevServer and ExtractI18n builders. `buildTarget` is to be used instead.\n-   Protractor is no longer supported.\n\n    Protractor was marked end-of-life in August 2023 (see https://protractortest.org/). Projects still relying on Protractor should consider migrating to another E2E testing framework, several support solid migration paths from Protractor.\n\n    -   https://angular.dev/tools/cli/end-to-end\n    -   https://blog.angular.dev/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/core)\n\n-   The deprecated `fileBuffer` function is no longer available. Update your code to use `stringToFileBuffer` instead to maintain compatibility.\n\n    **Note:** that this change does not affect application developers.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/build](https://redirect.github.com/angular/build)\n\n-   The `@angular/localize/init` polyfill will no longer be added automatically to projects. To prevent runtime issues, ensure that this polyfill is manually included in the \"polyfills\" section of your \"angular.json\" file if your application relies on Angular localization features.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/ssr](https://redirect.github.com/angular/ssr)\n\n-   The `CommonEngine` API now needs to be imported from `@angular/ssr/node`.\n\n    **Before**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr';\n    ```\n\n    **After**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr/node';\n    ```\n\n#####

The app-shell schematic is no longer compatible with Webpack-based builders.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/build-angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/build-angular)\n\n-   The `browserTarget` option has been removed from the DevServer and ExtractI18n builders. `buildTarget` is to be used instead.\n-   Protractor is no longer supported.\n\n    Protractor was marked end-of-life in August 2023 (see https://protractortest.org/). Projects still relying on Protractor should consider migrating to another E2E testing framework, several support solid migration paths from Protractor.\n\n    -   https://angular.dev/tools/cli/end-to-end\n    -   https://blog.angular.dev/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/core)\n\n-   The deprecated `fileBuffer` function is no longer available. Update your code to use `stringToFileBuffer` instead to maintain compatibility.\n\n    **Note:** that this change does not affect application developers.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/build](https://redirect.github.com/angular/build)\n\n-   The `@angular/localize/init` polyfill will no longer be added automatically to projects. To prevent runtime issues, ensure that this polyfill is manually included in the \"polyfills\" section of your \"angular.json\" file if your application relies on Angular localization features.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/ssr](https://redirect.github.com/angular/ssr)\n\n-   The `CommonEngine` API now needs to be imported from `@angular/ssr/node`.\n\n    **Before**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr';\n    ```\n\n    **After**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr/node';\n    ```\n\n#####

The app-shell schematic is no longer compatible with Webpack-based builders.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/build-angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/build-angular)\n\n-   The `browserTarget` option has been removed from the DevServer and ExtractI18n builders. `buildTarget` is to be used instead.\n-   Protractor is no longer supported.\n\n    Protractor was marked end-of-life in August 2023 (see https://protractortest.org/). Projects still relying on Protractor should consider migrating to another E2E testing framework, several support solid migration paths from Protractor.\n\n    -   https://angular.dev/tools/cli/end-to-end\n    -   https://blog.angular.dev/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/core)\n\n-   The deprecated `fileBuffer` function is no longer available. Update your code to use `stringToFileBuffer` instead to maintain compatibility.\n\n    **Note:** that this change does not affect application developers.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/build](https://redirect.github.com/angular/build)\n\n-   The `@angular/localize/init` polyfill will no longer be added automatically to projects. To prevent runtime issues, ensure that this polyfill is manually included in the \"polyfills\" section of your \"angular.json\" file if your application relies on Angular localization features.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/ssr](https://redirect.github.com/angular/ssr)\n\n-   The `CommonEngine` API now needs to be imported from `@angular/ssr/node`.\n\n    **Before**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr';\n    ```\n\n    **After**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr/node';\n    ```\n\n#####

[`v19.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1900-2024-11-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular-cli/compare/18.2.12...19.0.0)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### [@&#8203;schematics/angular](https://redirect.github.com/schematics/angular)\n\n-   The app-shell schematic is no longer compatible with Webpack-based builders.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/build-angular](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/build-angular)\n\n-   The `browserTarget` option has been removed from the DevServer and ExtractI18n builders. `buildTarget` is to be used instead.\n-   Protractor is no longer supported.\n\n    Protractor was marked end-of-life in August 2023 (see https://protractortest.org/). Projects still relying on Protractor should consider migrating to another E2E testing framework, several support solid migration paths from Protractor.\n\n    -   https://angular.dev/tools/cli/end-to-end\n    -   https://blog.angular.dev/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular-devkit/core)\n\n-   The deprecated `fileBuffer` function is no longer available. Update your code to use `stringToFileBuffer` instead to maintain compatibility.\n\n    **Note:** that this change does not affect application developers.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/build](https://redirect.github.com/angular/build)\n\n-   The `@angular/localize/init` polyfill will no longer be added automatically to projects. To prevent runtime issues, ensure that this polyfill is manually included in the \"polyfills\" section of your \"angular.json\" file if your application relies on Angular localization features.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular/ssr](https://redirect.github.com/angular/ssr)\n\n-   The `CommonEngine` API now needs to be imported from `@angular/ssr/node`.\n\n    **Before**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr';\n    ```\n\n    **After**\n\n    ```ts\n    import { CommonEngine } from '@&#8203;angular/ssr/node';\n    ```\n\n#####

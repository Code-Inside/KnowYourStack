I probably did something wrong with my routes configuration. But here is my problem:\r\n\r\nI've got this route configuration:\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [    \r\n    {\r\n        path: \"webspaces/:webSpaceName\",\r\n        title: \"Web Spaces\",\r\n        children: [\r\n            {\r\n                path: \"\",\r\n                redirectTo: \"login\",\r\n                pathMatch: \"full\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                path: 'login',\r\n                title: 'Login',\r\n                canActivate: [isAuthenticatedGuard],\r\n                component: LoginComponent\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                path: 'dashboard',\r\n                title: 'Dashboard',\r\n                canActivate: [isAuthenticatedGuard],\r\n                component: DashboardComponent\r\n            },\r\n        ]\r\n    },    \r\n    //otherwise redirect to home\r\n    { path: '**', component: HomeComponent}\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I want an url structured this way : /webspaces/:webSpaceName/login or /dashboard. I used an empty child route to redirect to login component. If I type /webspaces/**WS1** everything works correctly an I'm redirected to the login component and once logged in to dashboard component without any issue. But if I try to type the url directly in the browser like so : /webspaces/**WS1**/login, the url is automatically rewritten in lowercase as /webspaces/**ws1**/login which can be problematic on my project where the parameter is case sensitive.\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm currently only on local dev environment accessing the app by localhost.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nA children url is rewritten as lowercase when accessed directly by typing it in the browser navigation bar.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.7\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53859","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Url rewritten in lowercase when accessing child route without redirect\" (#53859)"},{"Id":"2073268653","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T22:30:53","Actor":"atscott","Number":"53860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"refactor(router): Update integration tests to cover navigatio…","State":"closed","Body":"…n and history API (#53799)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit eb2e879a008adebe11d63f42799570ba4f053c52.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53860","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"refactor(router): Update integration tests to cover navigatio…\" (#53860)"},{"Id":"2073039606","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T19:38:52","Actor":"atscott","Number":"53857","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): node removal notifies scheduler only when animations are enabled","State":"open","Body":"Node removal is immediate and does not require change detection to run when animations are not provided.

SCSS imports.\r\nI did see that the dart-sass dependency got upgraded between ng16 and ng17, and that there was some rework related to imports, but I assume that shouldn't have broken anything.\r\nNote: I can resolve this by adding the following to angular.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n  \"includePaths\": [\r\n    \"./\"\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you

When running the command 'ng build' parts of my code get removed.\r\n\r\nIn my development library environnement (BUG): \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error:\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/carousel-library and npm i\r\n2.  (optional) Run 'ng serve -o'. Everything works as expected in development (nothing has been removed).\r\n3. Run 'ng build'\r\n![find folder dist](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/69f145b0-9849-45f8-8cad-4bc782789e39)\r\nFind the corresponding file in the compiled code in the dist folder and search for the method 'resetViewLeftDirection'. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;', which is necessary for forcing element reflow, has been removed.\r\n\r\nIn a existing project (BUG):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/Portfolio and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz (winrar) at root .\r\n2. Have a look at the ngx-carousel-ease in the node_modules/fesm2022/ngx-carousel-ease.mjs.map. 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n![inside node_modules](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/2606ab3b-67b9-426b-abcc-3138681e8e0f)\r\n3. Now run 'ng build' and find the corresponding file in the dist folder: \r\n![last line gone](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/84795623/faeee759-e62a-4f73-9f4e-c8e5ff11f1a4)\r\n'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' has been removed in the compiled code.\r\n\r\nIn a new project (WORKING):\r\n1. Git clone https://github.com/GreenFlag31/lib-carousel and npm i. The library is contained in the tarball file .tgz at root .\r\n2. Run ng build\r\n3. Have a look at the corresponding compiled file in the dist folder. The 'this.slidesContainer.offsetHeight;' is present.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why this is working in a new project, and not in my developement environnement nor in an existing project. I don't know if it's a regression bug. I expect it to be a configuration problem. I've tried to get the same tsconfig from the working project in not working ones, but was unable to find the problem. \r\n\r\nWhen shipped to npm, the code includes the missing lines. When running 'ng build'  this line got removed. Is this some aggressive optimisation from ng build ? If this line got removed, it is totally possible that other part of the application get removed by ng build as well.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26825","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Severe] V17: ng-build removes part of library author code\" (#26825)"},{"Id":"2072911445","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:20:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26824","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"build: update dependency webpack-dev-middleware to v7\"","State":"closed","Body":"Reverts angular/angular-cli#26760","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26824","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"build: update dependency webpack-dev-middleware to v7\"\" (#26824)"},{"Id":"2072768259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:58:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26821","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove daily CI run for v14.x","State":"closed","Body":"Angular v14 is EOL.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove daily CI run for v14.x\" (#26821)"},{"Id":"2072759553","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:58:07","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26820","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove daily CI run for v13.x","State":"closed","Body":"Angular v13 is EOL.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove daily CI run for v13.x\" (#26820)"},{"Id":"2071694887","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T17:43:45","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26817","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.23.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | minor | `v3.22.12` -> `v3.23.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.23.0`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.22.12...v3.23.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.22.12...v3.23.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Fix issue where <mat-error/> does not render.\r\n\r\nExisting behavior is that _ErrorStateTracker sometimes reports error state as false when there is an error. This happens because Closure Compiler renames the _ErrorStateTracker's ErrorStateMatcher. The compiler renames all the other implementations of ErrorStateMatcher, but they have different names. Causes the matcher to be null in _ErrorStateTracker. Since ErrorStateMatcher is used as a class in some situations, Closure Compiler is not aware that it is intended to be the same type as the other implementations of ErrorStateMather.\r\n\r\nFix issue by declaring ErrorStateMatcher as an interface.

I think it is happening due to the order of module loading or the order the scss gets compiled to css, and thus the order that the styles get placed in the DOM.

was\n\n15.1\n\n### Description\n\nI have a table with 12 columns defined that I am defining CSS using .scss files.\r\nTwo of the columns have CSS that is not showing up in the compiled app.\r\n\r\n.mat-column-description and .mat-column-status-field css definitions are not showing up in rendered page\r\nwhile the 10 others do show up when defining .mat-column-{columnName}\r\n\r\nI do see the .mat-column-description and mat-column-status-field classes in the dev console, but there is no corresponding style entries.\r\n\r\nFor instance a column that works has:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-column-arrowKey[_ngcontent-ng-cli-universal-c1662717251] {\r\n    white-space: pre;\r\n    min-width: 100px;\r\n    max-width: 100px;\r\n    background-color: khaki;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut there is no such entries for .mat-column-description or mat-column-status-field...\r\n\r\nIt is annoying, because the description and status-field columns are collapsing if the browser is made narrow, rather than staying at a minimum width.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\n  public displayedColumns: string[] = [\r\n    'actions', 'arrowKey', 'fromLocation', 'toLocation',

Documentation says this is optional but code makes it required as reported in https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26270.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the mat-tab-nav-bar is wrapped in some other component, e.g. an AppHeaderComponent, but the MatTabNavPanel is outside this component, we need to pass the reference to the MatTabNavPanel via Input into the wrapper component like AppHeaderComponent and then use it in the template. This is the only way I can think of, but it throws a ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError (quite obvious for everyone who understand Angular's CD resolution algorithm really good, but hard to understand for everyone else), for example \r\n\r\n> ERROR Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked.

When the user types into the keyboard, the observable does not fire, thus the suggestions do not filter.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ea5mfd?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-display-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Focus on the input in the example.\r\n2. Start typing. You'll notice that the list does not filter, and the `pre` element below the input still has a value of null\r\n3. Select a value from the list with the keyboard or the mouse. You'll see that the `valueChanges` trigger, and the `pre` element contains our \"complex object\"\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect typing in the input would trigger `valueChanges` with the text that's been input, similar to how it works when the `requireSelection` property is set to false. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would expect that entering a value that is not present in the list would result in no changes to the selected value, as documented by the `requireSelection` documentation, even when it's used in conjunction with `displayWith`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen using `displayWith` in conjunction with `requireSelection`, the input `valueChanges` are only triggered by selecting a value from the list manually. Typing changes into the input _does not_ fire the observable. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatAutocomplete): When setting `MatAutocomplete.requireSelection = true`  and using the `MatAutocomplete.displayWith` input parameter, the `MatInput`'s `FormControl.valueChanges` observable does not emit values on text input, only on value selection\" (#28378)"},{"Id":"2067437291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T14:31:40","Actor":"maxime1992","Number":"28377","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe code I've got:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    importProvidersFrom(MatDialogModule),\r\n    {\r\n      provide:APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      multi:true,\r\n      useFactory: (dialog:MatDialog) => {\r\n        dialog.open(DialogComponent, {\r\n          data: {\r\n            helloWorld: true,\r\n          },\r\n        });\r\n        return () => true\r\n      },\r\n      deps:[MatDialog]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my dialog component looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./dialog.component.css'],\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule],\r\n})\r\nexport class DialogComponent {\r\n  @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public dialogData: any;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log({ dialogData: this.dialogData }); // this is always `undefined`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hbwckt?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nThen look at the console or the view where I've put a `| json` to debug.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBeing able to access the data passed to a dialog.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nData is always undefined.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `17.0.8`\r\n- CDK/Material: `17.0.4`\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatDialog): When creating a dialog from APP_INITIALIZER the MAT_DIALOG_DATA is always undefined\" (#28377)"},{"Id":"2067068880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-05T10:06:24","Actor":"webmichelle","Number":"28376","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-progress-spinner): stroke-width of svg circle not calculated properly for some diameter + strokeWidth values","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe `circle` element of the `mat-progress-spinner`'s SVG does not fill up to the whole space of it's container.

When the inheritance strategy is \"emptyOnly\", this isn't necessarily the root of the tree, but some point along the way (it stops once it reaches an ancestor route with a component).\r\n\r\nInstead, this commit updates parameter inheritance to only inherit data directly from the parent route (again, instead of recomputing all inherited data back to the inheritance root). The only requirement for making this work is that the parent route data has already calculated and updated its own inherited data. This was really already a requirement -- parents need to be processed before children.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the update to the inheritance algorithm in this commit requires more of an understanding that a resolver running higher up in the tree has to propagate inherited data downwards. The previous algorithm hid this knowledge because resolvers would recompute inherited data from the root when run. However, routes that did not have resolvers rerun or never had resolvers at all would not get the updated resolved data.\r\n\r\nfixes #51934\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52167","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): Ensure newly resolved data is inherited by child routes\" (#52167)"},{"Id":"1938311009","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-11T17:19:41","Actor":"atscott","Number":"52166","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v17.1.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the feature-freeze phase.

  migrating from the previously used ==. NgSwitch expressions and / or\n    individual condition values need adjusting to this stricter equality\n    check. The added warning message should help pinpointing NgSwitch\n    usages where adjustements are needed.\n\n##### core\n\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, …newItem]);\n    ```\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, …newItem]);\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The `withNoDomReuse()` function was removed from the public API. If you need to disable hydration, you can exclude the `provideClientHydration()` call from provider list in your application (which would disable hydration features for the entire application) or use `ngSkipHydration` attribute to disable hydration for particular components. See this guide for additional information: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#how-to-skip-hydration-for-particular-components.\n\n##### router\n\n-   Routes with `loadComponent` would incorrectly cause\n    child routes to inherit their data by default. The default\n    `paramsInheritanceStrategy` is `emptyOnly`. If parent data should be\n    inherited in child routes, this should be manually set to `always`.\n\n##### benchpress\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [2da3551a70](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2da3551a703ebef401d76a8e88e388437e851d85) | feat | report gc and render time spent in script ([#&#8203;50771](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/50771)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [da056a1fe2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/da056a1fe2816299319fb3f87416316be2029479) | fix | add missing types field for @&#8203;angular/common/locales of exports in package.json ([#&#8203;52080](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52080)) |\n| [85843e8212](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/85843e8212e99deb8b70f3d3f8dfe002b978cbb1) | fix | allow to specify only some properties of `DatePipeConfig` ([#&#8203;51287](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51287)) |\n| [28a5925f53](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/28a5925f53790067d45f1f68d204a36088dbf5e3) | fix | use === operator to match NgSwitch cases ([#&#8203;51504](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51504)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [1934524a0c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1934524a0c673fb65cd927c55c712f59446f9c93) | feat | add docs extraction for type aliases ([#&#8203;52118](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52118)) |\n| [7bfe20707f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7bfe20707fedff7290e12356a1545644b436d41c) | feat | extract api for fn overloads and abtract classes ([#&#8203;52040](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52040)) |\n| [7dbd47fb30](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7dbd47fb3015117c420f984181bfcb48e533525a) | fix | allow newlines in track and let expressions ([#&#8203;52137](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52137)) |\n| [9d19c8e317](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9d19c8e31752d211f575246282358b83afe90969) | fix | don't allocate variable to for loop expression ([#&#8203;52158](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52158)) |\n| [16ff08ec70](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/16ff08ec70bfa192041ba050e550676e8d505a05) | fix | narrow the type of expressions in event listeners inside if blocks ([#&#8203;52069](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52069)) |\n| [ac0d5dcfd6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ac0d5dcfd6015ec4283ed1a5cf241f130f4c5cf5) | fix | narrow the type of expressions in event listeners inside switch blocks ([#&#8203;52069](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52069)) |\n| [17078a3fe1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/17078a3fe1e9b90e48952b6c12b6e6b774b97810) | fix | pipes used inside defer triggers not being picked up ([#&#8203;52071](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52071)) |\n| [861ce3a7c5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/861ce3a7c574340a6164ad0de13f49bda3e172da) | fix | pipes using DI not working in blocks ([#&#8203;52112](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52112)) |\n| [386e1e9500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/386e1e950033ad98661e5077a4f119df0e7b3008) | fix | work around TypeScript bug when narrowing switch statements ([#&#8203;52110](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52110)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [11bb19cafc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/11bb19cafcf447b7ce6ade146d431a43c3e2c682) | fix | handle nested qualified names in ctor injection in local compilation mode ([#&#8203;51947](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51947)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [50275e58b8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/50275e58b80acfc52239908a6c61523e99f6731c) | feat | Add schematic to migrate control flow syntax ([#&#8203;52035](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52035)) |\n| [048f400efc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/048f400efc75011e888ea25d214a0211f91b96d4) | feat | add warnings for oversized images and lazy-lcp ([#&#8203;51846](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51846)) |\n| [4427e1ebc2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4427e1ebc29f5541cfe6a404f212de4359441812) | feat | create function to assert not running inside reactive context ([#&#8203;52049](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52049)) |\n| [5b88d136af](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5b88d136affdaa35e7015c00281b86cae040321b) | feat | mark core signal APIs as stable ([#&#8203;51821](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51821)) |\n| [8eef694def](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8eef694def3dc660779168925a380179c7e30993) | feat | Provide a diagnostic for missing Signal invocation in template interpolation.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0-next.8`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next8-2023-10-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/17.0.0-next.7...17.0.0-next.8)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   the NgSwitch directive now defaults to the === equality operator,\n    migrating from the previously used ==. NgSwitch expressions and / or\n    individual condition values need adjusting to this stricter equality\n    check. The added warning message should help pinpointing NgSwitch\n    usages where adjustements are needed.\n\n##### core\n\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, …newItem]);\n    ```\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, …newItem]);\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The `withNoDomReuse()` function was removed from the public API. If you need to disable hydration, you can exclude the `provideClientHydration()` call from provider list in your application (which would disable hydration features for the entire application) or use `ngSkipHydration` attribute to disable hydration for particular components. See this guide for additional information: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#how-to-skip-hydration-for-particular-components.\n\n##### router\n\n-   Routes with `loadComponent` would incorrectly cause\n    child routes to inherit their data by default. The default\n    `paramsInheritanceStrategy` is `emptyOnly`.

However, exposing it would be not a good solution as this would require us to have knowledge of the internals of the component to implement the solution.

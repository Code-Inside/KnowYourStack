This works around a unique limitation of Closure, where it will **always** inline string literals at **every** usage, regardless of how large the string literal is or how many times it is used.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use a function rather than a string literal. Closure has differently inlining semantics for functions, where it will check the length of the function and the number of times it is used before choosing to inline it. By using a function, `ngtsc` makes Closure more conservative about inlining large strings, and avoids blowing up the bundle size.\r\n\r\nThis optimization is only used if the constant is a large string. A wrapping function is not included for other use cases, since it would just increase the bundle size and add unnecessary runtime performance overhead.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nAngular Material button component is almost twice as large in Ivy as View Engine. This appears to be because it shares styles across two components (`MatButton` and `MatAnchor`), which are deduplicated in View Engine but not in Ivy. This is partially because Closure compiler will **always** inline string constants at **every** usage. This causes strings to be duplicated, and large strings (such as CSS styling) get duplicated.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: http://b/161849099\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe Angular compiler will generate large string constants as being wrapped in a function and invoked where needed. This tricks Closure into **not** inlining the large strings and prevents the bundle size duplication.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nAlso see http://b/162106151 for additional context and a response from the Closure compiler team.\r\n\r\nI'm also not totally sure what implication this will have on Terser.

This type-constructor call\r\nserves two purposes:\r\n\r\n1. Infer any generic types for the directive instance from the inputs\r\n   that are passed in.\r\n2. Type check the inputs that are passed into the directive's inputs.\r\n\r\nThe first purpose is only relevant when the directive actually has any\r\ngeneric types and using a type-constructor for these cases inhibits\r\na type-check performance penalty, as a type-constructor's signature is\r\nquite complex and needs to be generated for each directive.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the generated type-check blocks to only generate\r\na type-constructor call for directives that have generic types. Type\r\nchecking of inputs is achieved by generating individual statements for\r\nall inputs, using assignments into the directive's fields.\r\n\r\nEven if a type-constructor is used for type-inference of generic types\r\nwill the input checking also be achieved using the individual assignment\r\nstatements. This is done to support the rework of the language service,\r\nwhich will start to extract symbol information from the type-check\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nAs a future optimization, it may be possible to reduce the number of\r\ninputs passed into a type-constructor to only those inputs that\r\ncontribute the the type-inference of the generics.

Examples of such requests (actually, reported as bugs) would be #38043 or #38087 (but I'm sure that there are more as I've seen similar issues reported in the past.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the current Angular behaviour is the result of *deliberate design choices* and not a simple bug / omission that we can \"just fix\". The current design of taking lifecycle hooks from a prototype is based on the following:\r\n* performance considerations;\r\n* inheritance support.\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\n\r\nAs of today Angular assumes that all directives created from a given class have the same set of lifecycle functions (taken from a prototype). This assumptions allows us to make 2 significant optimisations:\r\n* store lifecycle hooks only once for a given directive class, regardless of how many times it is instantiated (imagine a ngFor loop over hundreds of components / directives - as of today we need to store info about lifecycle hooks only one, regardless of the number of instances - if each instance could have different lifecycle hooks we would have to allocate memory for each instance, adding to GC pressure, consuming more memory and making the app slower overall);\r\n* invoke lifecycle hooks on all instances without worrying about checking if a given hook exists - basically we _know_ that all components / directives share the same set so we can iterate over all instances and call hooks, without doing any checks.\r\n\r\nThose things might sound like micr-optimisations but when you profile applications it has significant impact. Angular always worked this way as we made the assumption that the user experience (performance of a final app for the users) is more important that the developers experience here. \r\n \r\n### Inheritance\r\n\r\nWith the assumptions of a fixed set of lifecycle hooks for a directive it is easy for us to compute a new set of lifecycle hooks in the directives inheritance tree.  Again, we can do those calculations only once (per directive class), without checking each individual instance.\r\n\r\n## Possible work-arrounds \r\n\r\n@petebacondarwin [suggested](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38043#issuecomment-663475929) that one might work-arround the current design choices like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-root', template: ''})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  title = 'test-app';\r\n}\r\n\r\n(AppComponent.prototype as any).ngOnInit = () => {\r\n  console.log('init!');\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue as a feature request, mostly to track interest and ideas for another implementation that wouldn't negatively impact performance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow lifecycle hooks to be defined on a directive instance and not only on a prototype\" (#38241)"},{"Id":"665982791","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-27T05:19:45","Actor":"devpato","Number":"38240","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pr template","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This takes around a minute. Since I wish to automatically test that my schematic outputs valid code, I don't need code to be generated, merely know if the code compiles. Thus, I want to only execute the first stages of the angular compilation process.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd a commandline flag to build which prevents it from outputting any code. For similarity with typescript, I would call it `--noEmit`, after the typescript flag which does the same thing.\r\n\r\nThus,\r\n```\r\nng build --noEmit\r\n```\r\nwould run all stages of compilation up to the point where it is clear that the code will successfully build. This would be the parsing and typechecking phases most likely, though I am not familiar enough with the angular compiler to know for sure\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI thought maybe `ng lint --type-check`  would do what I want. However, `ng lint --type-check` does not catch type errors. \r\n\r\nI could build a system which watches the output of the angular builder and then kills the process as soon as it enters the code generation phase. However, this seems a kludgy solution. \r\n\r\nAdding '\"noEmit\":true' to `tsconfig.base.json` suppresses the typescript generation, thereby saving ~30s of the ~60s build time, but angular cares on its marry way attempting to bundle anyway, leading to the console filling with erroneous warnings of unnecessary files included in the build. While the best alternatives  I have found, it seems that suppressing output on an angular level would still be superior as this would save even more time, and cause no erroneous warnings.

However, in prod mode, code is minified and the above code is minified to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst {...clone} = originalObject;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the property is not removed from the object and the code is broken.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not an angular issue, but it took me a while to figure out what was the problem and why it worked in dev mode, but failed in prod mode. \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[Link to the repo with repro app](https://github.com/dima716/repro-app)\r\n\r\nJust run ```ng serve``` and then ```ng serve --prod``` and compare the results.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.29\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.29\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.29\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.29\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.29\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.29\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.29\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.29\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.29\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.29\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.29\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ES7 Object Rest Operator to Omit Properties fails in prod mode\" (#18361)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"666771240","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-28T05:04:51","Actor":"howardjing","Number":"20112","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/scrolling): Documentation for using cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport is incorrect ","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe API reference for Angular CDK scrolling (https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/api) only mentions `CdkScrollableModule` and does not mention `ScrollingModule`. `ScrollingModule` should be mentioned in the documentation -- for example it is required to use `cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport`.\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAPI reference for Angular CDK scrolling\r\nimport {CdkScrollableModule} from '@angular/cdk/scrolling';\r\n```\r\nIn order to use `cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport`, I need to import `ScrollingModule` from `@angular/cdk/scrolling` instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

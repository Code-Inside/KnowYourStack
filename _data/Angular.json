Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWanted to get a sense of whether this feature would be considered at all, but happy to participate in the design phase if it's given the green light.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNot using `HttpClientModule`: I'm not very familiar with the Angular ecosystem, so I'm not sure whether it would be acceptable to use plain `fetch` (meaning without the added benefits of `HttpClientModule`) for this use case or what the tradeoffs would be.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52494","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow consumers to read individual `ReadableStream` chunks when using `FetchBackend`\" (#52494)"},{"Id":"1972881881","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-02T18:06:28","Actor":"clydin","Number":"52485","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: additional application builder SSR conversion information","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The method in question can be found [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/delete-output-dir.ts#L15). If we used something like fs-extra's `emptyDirSync` (see [here](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/a277cbbdf630424482b1e7418749ccaac0db98fe/lib/empty/index.js#L20)) instead, we could just empty the output directory rather than deleting it. This would make it a lot more usable and should have theoretically the same impact without running into lock errors or permission errors on the file.\r\n\r\nI would put in a PR, but I'm not currently on a machine where that's easy to do!\r\n\r\nIf this would be considered a breaking change, another thought would be to add another flag.

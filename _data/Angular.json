I have an app with a just common lazy loaded module which uses HttpClientModule (and HttpClient). While it compiles and works locally (!), when I deploy it and go to that specific route __*nothing happens*__. I mean you click on a button but really nothing happens. There are no errors in the console either!\r\n\r\nIt's good I have a global error handler which logs all of the errors. So, I found out the error was:\r\n> Error: Uncaught (in promise): ReferenceError: Cannot access 'P' before initialization\r\n\r\nFirst, I thought I had a cyclic reference somewhere... so I checked everything and no, I didn't have it. Then I just added HttpClientModule to my module's `imports` and published the app again. Voila! It works now!\r\n\r\nI have to add my app uses i18n, so I build it for different languages. And for default locale it works, but for others it DOES NOT.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis must be reported at least in the console.

The reason why that button is hard to find is because the button gets hidden when the user scrolls down, and the button blends in very well to the rest of the page, meaning that the user has to be actively looking for the button, which can be hard for people, including me, with low vision or who are legally blind.\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/docs\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nI found a typo in the CLI Builder docs (see PR #48129), and I was having trouble finding the edit button.

Essentially, I had to find a needle in the haystack, and I found a broken affordance.\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\nI know that Angular can do better with its docs with better utilization of Angular Material. I know that UIs written in Material are of high quality because I have interacted with Google's G Suite apps, including Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Slides, since 2019. Although there are many ways to update the UI, I would like to give the following suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Make the button's position fixed relative to the browser window; this will make the button easier to see no matter where the user is at on the page.\r\n2. Either add a shadow, an outline, or a contrasting fill to the button for better visibility.\r\n3.

However, a longstanding bug caused the method to not fire when an *enabled* control was attached. This bug was fixed in v15.\r\n\r\nThis had a side effect: previously, it was possible to instantiate a reactive form control with `[attr.disabled]=true`, even though the the corresponding control was enabled in the model. (Note that the similar-looking property binding version `[disabled]=true` was always rejected, though.) This resulted in a mismatch between the model and the DOM. Now, because `setDisabledState` is always called, the value in the DOM will be immediately overwritten with the \"correct\" enabled value.\r\n\r\nUsers should instead disable the control directly in their model. (There are many ways to do this, such as using the `{value: 'foo', disabled: true}` constructor format, or immediately calling `FooControl.disable()` in `ngOnInit`.)\r\n\r\nIf this incompatibility is too breaking, you may also opt out using `FormsModule.withConfig` or `ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig` at the time you import it, via the `callSetDisabledState` option.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an exceptional case: radio buttons. Because Reactive Forms models the entire group of radio buttons as a single `FormControl`, there is no way to control the disabled state for individual radios, so they can no longer be configured as disabled.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we have special cased radio buttons to ignore their first call to `setDisabledState` when in `callSetDisabledState: 'always'` mode.

See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+import.meta.url+\r\n\r\nThis issue, which describes the problem well: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388 was closed bcause it's actually Webpack's fault and Webpack *used* to unconditionally rewrite `import.meta.url` to something useless in the absence of a loader.  But now we can stop Webpack from doing that, using the `parser.javascript.importMeta` option: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/15246\r\n\r\n... except that to do this in Angular requires a custom webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nSince we are not supposed to have webpack-specific configuration in the angular config, it would be nice if the default behaviour of Angular was non-broken.  Obviously it would have to be done while conserving the (arguably broken and inconsistent) policy of *sometimes* using loaders and *sometimes* not using them.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSomething about not being able to access local content\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.1.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\nwebpack                         5.75.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24616","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular should disable webpack's import.meta.url parsing by default\" (#24616)"},{"Id":"1559233507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-27T06:14:22","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24618","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.20.7` -> `7.20.14`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.20.7/7.20.14) |\n| [@babel/generator](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-generator) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.20.7` -> `7.20.14`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.20.7/7.20.14) |\n| [bazel_skylib](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib) | http_archive | minor | `1.3.0` -> `1.4.0` |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | optionalDependencies | patch | [`0.17.4` -> `0.17.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.17.4/0.17.5) |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.17.4` -> `0.17.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.17.4/0.17.5) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | dependencies | patch | [`0.17.4` -> `0.17.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.17.4/0.17.5) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.17.4` -> `0.17.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.17.4/0.17.5) |\n| [eslint](https://eslint.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.32.0` -> `8.33.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/eslint/8.32.0/8.33.0) |\n| [tslib](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/tslib)) | dependencies | minor | [`2.4.1` -> `2.5.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/tslib/2.4.1/2.5.0) |\n| [tslib](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/tslib)) | devDependencies | minor | [`2.4.1` -> `2.5.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/tslib/2.4.1/2.5.0) |\n| [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)) | devDependencies | minor | [`5.19.1` -> `5.20.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/verdaccio/5.19.1/5.20.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel</summary>\n\n### [`v7.20.14`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v72014-2023-01-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.20.7...v7.20.14)\n\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n-   `babel-plugin-transform-block-scoping`\n    -

You can now add the `const` modifier on a type parameter of a function, method, or class like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <const T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] });\n    ```\n\n    The type of `names` in the above example is `readonly [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"]`. Marking the type parameter as `const` behaves as if you had written `as const` at every use instead. The above code is equivalent to the following TypeScript, which was the only option before TypeScript 5.0:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] } as const);\n    ```\n\n    You can read [the announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/#const-type-parameters) for more information.\n\n-   Make parsing generic `async` arrow functions more strict in `.tsx` files\n\n    Previously esbuild's TypeScript parser incorrectly accepted the following code as valid:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T> () => {};\n    ```\n\n    The official TypeScript parser rejects this code because it thinks it's the identifier `async` followed by a JSX element starting with `<T>`. So with this release, esbuild will now reject this syntax in `.tsx` files too. You'll now have to add a comma after the type parameter to get generic arrow functions like this to parse in `.tsx` files:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T,> () => {};\n    ```\n\n-   Allow the `in` and `out` type parameter modifiers on class expressions\n\n    TypeScript 4.7 added the `in` and `out` modifiers on the type parameters of classes, interfaces, and type aliases. However, while TypeScript supported them on both class expressions and class statements, previously esbuild only supported them on class statements due to an oversight. This release now allows these modifiers on class expressions too:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare let Foo: any;\n    Foo = class <in T> { };\n    Foo = class <out T> { };\n    ```\n\n-   Update `enum` constant folding for TypeScript 5.0\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 contains an [updated definition of what it considers a constant expression](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/50528):\n\n    > An expression is considered a *constant expression* if it is\n    >\n    > -   a number or string literal,\n    > -   a unary `+`, `-`, or `~` applied to a numeric constant expression,\n    > -   a binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `|`, `&`, `^` applied to two numeric constant expressions,\n    > -   a binary `+` applied to two constant expressions whereof at least one is a string,\n    > -   a template expression where each substitution expression is a constant expression,\n    > -   a parenthesized constant expression,\n    > -   a dotted name (e.g. `x.y.z`) that references a `const` variable with a constant expression initializer and no type annotation,\n    > -   a dotted name that references an enum member with an enum literal type, or\n    > -   a dotted name indexed by a string literal (e.g. `x.y[\"z\"]`) that references an enum member with an enum literal type.\n\n    This impacts esbuild's implementation of TypeScript's `const enum` feature. With this release, esbuild will now attempt to follow these new rules. For example, you can now initialize an `enum` member with a template literal expression that contains a numeric constant:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original input\n    const enum Example {\n      COUNT = 100,\n      ERROR = `Expected ${COUNT} items`,\n    }\n    console.log(\n      Example.COUNT,\n      Example.ERROR,\n    )\n\n    // Old output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    var Example = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Example2) => {\n      Example2[Example2[\"COUNT\"] = 100] = \"COUNT\";\n      Example2[Example2[\"ERROR\"] = `Expected ${100 /* COUNT */} items`] = \"ERROR\";\n      return Example2;\n    })(Example || {});\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      Example.ERROR\n    );\n\n    // New output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      \"Expected 100 items\" /* ERROR */\n    );\n    ```\n\n    These rules are not followed exactly due to esbuild's limitations. The rule about dotted references to `const` variables is not followed both because esbuild's enum processing is done in an isolated module setting and because doing so would potentially require esbuild to use a type system, which it doesn't have. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    // The TypeScript compiler inlines this but esbuild doesn't:\n    declare const x = 'foo'\n    const enum Foo { X = x }\n    console.log(Foo.X)\n    ```\n\n    Also, the rule that requires converting numbers to a string currently only followed for 32-bit signed integers and non-finite numbers. This is done to avoid accidentally introducing a bug if esbuild's number-to-string operation doesn't exactly match the behavior of a real JavaScript VM. Currently esbuild's number-to-string constant folding is conservative for safety.\n\n-   Forbid definite assignment assertion operators on class methods\n\n    In TypeScript, class methods can use the `?` optional property operator but not the `!` definite assignment assertion operator (while class fields can use both):\n\n    ```ts\n    class Foo {\n      // These are valid TypeScript\n      a?\n      b!\n      x?() {}\n\n      // This is invalid TypeScript\n      y!() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly allowed the definite assignment assertion operator with class methods. This will no longer be allowed starting with this release.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.33.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.33.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.32.0...v8.33.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`2cc7954`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2cc7954cdb1fed44e8a5d3c9b3ea1deceadb5e00) feat: add `restrictDefaultExports` option to no-restricted-exports rule ([#&#8203;16785](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16785)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`17f4be2`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/17f4be2b66deb81f4e9ffb3d6bdfb79f3fcf85a2) docs: Fix examples in no-multiple-empty-lines rule ([#&#8203;16835](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16835)) (jonz94)\n-   [`9c7cfe3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9c7cfe33c4a39cf2c23529afe02030ea7f8acf70) docs: 'Source Code' content in 'Set up Development Environment' page ([#&#8203;16780](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16780)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ede5c64`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ede5c6475469a905da4f559ab55f0ee73168a9d7) docs: Custom processors page ([#&#8203;16802](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16802)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`2620614`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2620614f525de13f2e3ab0a7cd92abe89dae4897) docs: Code of Conduct page ([#&#8203;16781](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16781)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`50a8efd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/50a8efd957c70c9978a8ed25744a24193b00e078) docs: report a sec vulnerability page ([#&#8203;16808](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16808)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ed60afd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ed60afd4450e769a975447178299446f4439d926) docs: Update page titles, section landing pages, and side TOC ([#&#8203;16760](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16760)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`333c712`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/333c71243537966930e9ab8178bc98c37949b5f2) docs: add background to code-path-diagrams for dark-mode ([#&#8203;16822](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16822)) (Tanuj Kanti)\n-   [`f5f7b9b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f5f7b9b8b512f5c6a5b4a1037f81bb3f5a7311e0) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2aa4f5f`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2aa4f5fb2fdb1c4a1734093c225e5c6251b0ee0f) docs: no-constant-condition: Add multi-comparison example ([#&#8203;16776](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16776)) (Sebastian Simon)\n-   [`40287db`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/40287dbe7407934a69805f02ece07491778c3694) docs: Remove Google Group icon ([#&#8203;16779](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16779)) (Nicholas C.

You are damned if you do and damned if you don't!  If you do what is suggested in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22351 and try to use the `assets` option, the actually generated code will *not* reference this asset because `import.meta.url` got rewritten to some path on your build filesystem.\r\n\r\nBut if you then disable `module.parser.java.importmeta` manually in a custom webpack config, then you end up with `import.meta.url` in the output code, which utterly breaks testing with karma (since karma does not do ES6 modules, because that's like not groovy, man) and of course also any possibility of targeting a non-ES6-aware browser.\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of webpack's perfectly good and sane defaults.  A reasonable workaround is to create a custom webpack config which *enables* `module.parser.java.url`, like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  module: {\r\n    parser: {\r\n      javascript: {\r\n        url: true,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nFrom an Angular app, try to load an ES6 module (like https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundswallower?activeTab=explore) that has an accompanying WASM file, or any kind of asset that is loaded with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`.  The relevant code output by Emscripten is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n wasmBinaryFile = new URL(\"soundswallower.web.wasm\", import.meta.url).href;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No

With this release, esbuild's serve mode will also respond to HTTP `HEAD` requests, which are just like HTTP `GET` requests except that the body of the response is omitted.\n\n-   Permit top-level await in dead code branches ([#&#8203;2853](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2853))\n\n    Adding top-level await to a file has a few consequences with esbuild:\n\n    1.  It causes esbuild to assume that the input module format is ESM, since top-level await is only syntactically valid in ESM. That prevents you from using `module` and `exports` for exports and also enables strict mode, which disables certain syntax and changes how function hoisting works (among other things).\n    2.  This will cause esbuild to fail the build if either top-level await isn't supported by your language target (e.g. it's not supported in ES2021) or if top-level await isn't supported by the chosen output format (e.g. it's not supported with CommonJS).\n    3.  Doing this will prevent you from using `require()` on this file or on any file that imports this file (even indirectly), since the `require()` function doesn't return a promise and so can't represent top-level await.\n\n    This release relaxes these rules slightly: rules 2 and 3 will now no longer apply when esbuild has identified the code branch as dead code, such as when it's behind an `if (false)` check. This should make it possible to use esbuild to convert code into different output formats that only uses top-level await conditionally. This release does not relax rule 1. Top-level await will still cause esbuild to unconditionally consider the input module format to be ESM, even when the top-level `await` is in a dead code branch. This is necessary because whether the input format is ESM or not affects the whole file, not just the dead code branch.\n\n-   Fix entry points where the entire file name is the extension ([#&#8203;2861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2861))\n\n    Previously if you passed esbuild an entry point where the file extension is the entire file name, esbuild would use the parent directory name to derive the name of the output file. For example, if you passed esbuild a file `./src/.ts` then the output name would be `src.js`. This bug happened because esbuild first strips the file extension to get `./src/` and then joins the path with the working directory to get the absolute path (e.g. `join(\"/working/dir\", \"./src/\")` gives `/working/dir/src`). However, the join operation also canonicalizes the path which strips the trailing `/`. Later esbuild uses the \"base name\" operation to extract the name of the output file. Since there is no trailing `/`, esbuild returns `\"src\"` as the base name instead of `\"\"`, which causes esbuild to incorrectly include the directory name in the output file name. This release fixes this bug by deferring the stripping of the file extension until after all path manipulations have been completed. So now the file `./src/.ts` will generate an output file named `.js`.\n\n-   Support replacing property access expressions with inject\n\n    At a high level, this change means the `inject` feature can now replace all of the same kinds of names as the `define` feature. So `inject` is basically now a more powerful version of `define`, instead of previously only being able to do some of the things that `define` could do.\n\n    Soem background is necessary to understand this change if you aren't already familiar with the `inject` feature. The `inject` feature lets you replace references to global variable with a shim. It works like this:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as the name of the global variable you intend to replace\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected.js\n    let processShim = { cwd: () => '/' }\n    export { processShim as process }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process` with the `processShim` variable, which will cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'`. This feature is sort of abusing the ESM export alias syntax to specify the mapping of global variables to shims. But esbuild works this way because using this syntax for that purpose is convenient and terse.\n\n    However, if you wanted to replace a property access expression, the process was more complicated and not as nice. You would have to:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as some random name\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n    4.  Use esbuild's `define` feature to map the property access expression to the random name you made in step 2\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected2.js --define:process.cwd=someRandomName`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected2.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as someRandomName }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which this time will not mess with other references to `process`, which might be desirable).\n\n    With this release, using the inject feature to replace a property access expression is now as simple as using it to replace an identifier. You can now use JavaScript's [\"arbitrary module namespace identifier names\"](https://togithub.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2154) feature to specify the property access expression directly using a string literal. For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected3.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected3.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as 'process.cwd' }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will now replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which will also not mess with other references to `process`).\n\n    In addition to inserting a shim for a global variable that doesn't exist, another use case is replacing references to static methods on global objects with cached versions to both minify them better and to make access to them potentially faster. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Injected file\n    let cachedMin = Math.min\n    let cachedMax = Math.max\n    export {\n      cachedMin as 'Math.min',\n      cachedMax as 'Math.max',\n    }\n\n    // Original input\n    function clampRGB(r, g, b) {\n      return {\n        r: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, r)),\n        g: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, g)),\n        b: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, b)),\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function clampRGB(a,t,m){return{r:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,a)),g:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,t)),b:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,m))}}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    var a=Math.min,t=Math.max;function clampRGB(h,M,m){return{r:t(0,a(1,h)),g:t(0,a(1,M)),b:t(0,a(1,m))}}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But like `mat-card-header` or `mat-card-content`, a `mat-card-primary-action` directive could be nice and avoid direct usage of MDC\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n#### Actual\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-card>\r\n  <div class=\"mdc-card__primary-action\" tabindex=\"0\" matRipple>\r\n    <!-- content -->\r\n  </div>\r\n</mat-card>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-card>\r\n  <div mat-card-primary-action>\r\n    <!-- content -->\r\n  </div>\r\n</mat-card>\r\n\r\n<mat-card>\r\n  <mat-card-primary-action>\r\n    <!-- content -->\r\n  </mat-card-primary-action>\r\n</mat-card>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26497","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(card): Add primary action directive/component\" (#26497)"},{"Id":"1556774752","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-25T14:44:11","Actor":"angelaki","Number":"26496","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-slider): `value` updated on slide","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen sliding, the value is updated several times on sliding now.

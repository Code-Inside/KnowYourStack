The\r\nprimary difference between basic and full modes is that basic mode only\r\nchecks the top-level template, whereas full mode descends into nested\r\ntemplates (embedded views like ngIfs and ngFors). Ivy applies this approach\r\nto all of its template type-checking, including the DOM schema checks which\r\nvalidate whether an element is a valid component/directive or not.\r\n\r\nView Engine has both the basic and the full mode, with the same distinction.\r\nHowever in View Engine, DOM schema checks happen for the full template even\r\nin the basic mode.\r\n\r\nIvy's behavior here is technically a \"fix\" as it does not make sense for\r\nsome checks to apply to the full template and others only to the top-level\r\nview. However, since g3 relies exclusively on the basic mode of checking and\r\ndevelopers there are used to DOM checks applying throughout their template,\r\nthis commit re-enables the nested schema checks even in basic mode only in\r\ng3. This is done by enabling the checks only when Closure Compiler\r\nannotations are requested.\r\n\r\nOutside of g3, it's recommended that applications use at least the full mode\r\nof checking (controlled by the `fullTemplateTypeCheck` flag), and ideally\r\nthe strict mode (`strictTemplates`).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38943","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): perform DOM schema checks even in basic mode in g3\" (#38943)"},{"Id":"706120089","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-22T16:55:28","Actor":"edwin042","Number":"38934","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error in fetching API with Bearer Token Header","State":"closed","Body":"Access to XMLHttpRequest at '['api url]' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38934","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error in fetching API with Bearer Token Header\" (#38934)"},{"Id":"706511492","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-22T16:05:22","Actor":"johncrim","Number":"38940","RawContent":null,"Title":"Spell out tree-shaking, sideEffects: false, and polyfills","State":"open","Body":"# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo obtain the benefits of [webpack tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), the recommendation is to correctly set the `sideEffects:` property in package.json files for libraries and apps.\r\n\r\nIn [a recent Angular.io blog post about strict mode and improving build size](https://blog.angular.io/angular-cli-strict-mode-c94ba5965f63), it's recommended that `sideEffects: false` be set in the app package.json.

However, checkboxes or select inputs are inherently different from text inputs in one specific way: frequency of value changes, with the latter receiving significantly more.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be nice if individual form controls could easily be debounced such that their valueChange emits less frequently. This is opposed to debouncing the entire FormGroup's valueChange which would unnecessarily debounce these other controls as well.\r\n\r\nI maintain a library, [ngqp](https://github.com/TNG/ngqp) which uses the forms infrastructure to wire up form controls with query parameters, and there I have this feature implemented and got the inspiration from to make this feature request.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAn addition to AbstractControlOptions such that this can be done:\r\n\r\n```\r\nformBuilder.control('', {debounceTime: 100});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTechnically this can already be achieved by splitting the valueChange observable using distinctUntilChanged etc. and merging it back, but that requires quite a bit of effort.

See:\r\nhttps://jsonlint.com/\r\nhttps://www.json.org/json-en.html\r\n\r\n### Detailed description:\r\nThe `post()` method of `HttpClient` (and other request methods) accept a body method argument of type `any`. When the HTTP request is about to execute, `HttpClient` will determine the content type of `body`, so that it can set the `Content-Type` header to for example `application/json` or `text/plain`.\r\n\r\nWhen an object is used as `body`, HttpClient will send it as `application/json` as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen a plain number is used as `body` (e.g. `123`, without quotes), HttpClient will also send it as `application/json`, because even a plain number (without curly braces and without quotes) is valid JSON.\r\n\r\nWhen a TypeScript string is used as `body` argument (e.g. `\"abc\"`), HttpClient will send it as `text/plain` because it will be send without quotes in the HTTP request body, and thus isn't valid JSON. So it will use `text/plain` as expected.\r\n\r\nBut when boolean is used, this behavior is different. When a plain boolean (e.g. `true`) is used as `body` argument, HttpClient will send it as `text/plain` even though a simple plain boolean is valid JSON.\r\n\r\nThe code where this problems is caused is:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2686219fcee938fbb4359aa6318ffd97f91b0240/packages/common/http/src/request.ts#L295\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Arrays, objects, and numbers will be encoded as JSON.\r\n    if (typeof this.body === 'object' || typeof this.body === 'number' || Array.isArray(this.body)) {\r\n      return 'application/json';\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlain objects, numbers, booleans and arrays values are all [valid JSON code](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Whereas a plain string without quotes it not valid JSON.\r\nSo plain objects, numbers, booleans and arrays values should be send as `application/json` and strings as `text/plain`. But in HttpClient this behavior unexpectedly differs for booleans.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-umexba?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, VERSION } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendObject()\">Send object</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendNumber()\">Send number</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendBoolean()\">Send boolean</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendString()\">Send string</button>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent  {\r\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  sendObject() {\r\n    // 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", {x: 1}).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendNumber() {\r\n    // 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", 123).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendBoolean() {\r\n    // `text/plain`, but should be 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", true).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendString() {\r\n    // `text/plain`\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", \"abc\").subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>10.1.2</pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38924","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpClient - incorrect ContentType for boolean\" (#38924)"},{"Id":"705801305","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T17:55:17","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"38922","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): update docs examples to Angular v10 (and related changes)","State":"open","Body":"WIP","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38922","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): update docs examples to Angular v10 (and related changes)\" (#38922)"},{"Id":"705767538","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T17:00:37","Actor":"adrianlafond","Number":"38921","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-content API docs are missing","State":"open","Body":"# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNo API page for `ng-content` exists. `ng-content` is mentioned on several pages, almost in passing (eg, https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks), but searching brings up no dedicated page with API info.

possibly regret that choice (or resent the default they didn't realise they could change).\r\n\r\nI think we should stop steering people in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think it would be preferable to either ship with a tool that is actively maintained or to ship without a default tool at all and just provide documentation on how to configure the tool of their choice (just the Angular specific docs, they can get tool specific docs from the tool they choose).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf I'm wrong about the maintenance status of protractor, then a possible alternative is that it becomes an actively maintained, \r\n user friendly solution that's worthy of the default tool

new plugin API, `node_modules` size reduction, better source map support, and CSS parser improvements.\n\nCheck out [a day-by-day diary](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936) of PostCSS 8.0 development process.\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n-   `postcss-cli` need to be updated PostCSS to run new plugins\n-   `gulp-postcss` need to be updated PostCSS to run new plugins\n-   `postcss-load-plugins` (used by some environments) can’t load new plugins\n\n#### Thanks to Sponsors\n\nWith more than [100 M downloads per month](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=postcss), it becomes hard to support PostCSS in free time. For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The structural styles are close to what we have in the current paginator, while the theming and typography are implemented on top of MDC's mixins. Furthermore, we're using the MDC versions of `mat-select` and `mat-button` inside the paginator.\r\n\r\nThere are the following gotchas in this implementation:\r\n1. The `mat-form-field` inside the paginator is set to always use the densest layout possible. This is necessary, because the MDC form field is too tall by default.\r\n2. We hide one internal element from the form field, because it throws off the vertical alignment and is only used for hints and error messages which the paginator doesn't have.\r\n3. I had to duplicate the `MatPaginatorDefaultOptions` interface, because the appearance of the MDC form field doesn't support the `legacy` and `standard` values.\r\n\r\n**Note:** doesn't include a test harness, because it depends on #20603.

By pushing the `AbstractControl` container type into the helpers, we can explicitly include `null` in the failure cases (but *not* in the success cases), allowing us to have more correct types:\r\n\r\n* If the control is known to be present, `null` can be excluded.\r\n* If the control is known to be absent, we can fail to just `null` instead of `AbstractControl<never>`, which is more correct\r\n* For indeterminate cases (e.g. non-const arrays), we fail to `AbstractControl<any>|null`, which is exactly the same as before\r\n\r\nThis comes at the cost of a slightly messier `ɵNavigate`, which is OK since it's an internal type anyway.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the improvement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fg = new FormGroup({\r\n  foo: new FormControl('bar'),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Before: an exclamation point is required\r\nconst val = fg.get('foo')!.value;\r\n\r\n// After: the compiler knows the control exists and is non-null\r\nconst val = fg.get('foo').value;\r\n\r\n// Before: `AbstractControl<never>`\r\nconst val = fg.get('oops');\r\n\r\n// After: `null`\r\nconst val = fg.get('oops');\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspired by [this YAQS question](https://yaqs.corp.google.com/eng/q/1033305634621095936), as well as feedback from @cexbrayat.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): Tighten up the typing of `.get`.\" (#46115)"},{"Id":"1245748736","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T22:09:12","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"46114","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): improve error for non-exported non-standalone","State":"open","Body":"improve the error message for non-standalone components which are not\r\nexported from their module, and that are also imported directly as if\r\nthey were standalone\r\n\r\nthis change simply adds the suggestion to the developer to import the\r\nngModule instead\r\n\r\nresolves #46004\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is a really rare use case where we are enlarging the size of the System Under Test a bit.\r\nI am covering this here because if we find a solution for this issue, it has to be compatible with this second use case too. Even though it should be super rare.\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\n\r\nThe issue with Standalone Components is that we can't do this anymore because declaring the component in the test bed's module, doesn't work producing the following error:\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/yjaaidi/ng-experiments/blob/angular-standalone-shallow-testing-issue/src/app/app.component.spec.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: Unexpected \"AppComponent\" declaration in \"DynamicTestModule\" NgModule. \"AppComponent\" is marked as standalone and can't be declared in any NgModule - did you intend to import it?\r\n            at verifySemanticsOfNgModuleDef (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/core.mjs:24462:15)\r\n            at Function.get (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/core.mjs:24388:21)\r\n            at R3TestBedCompiler.applyProviderOverridesToModule (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1084:39)\r\n            at R3TestBedCompiler.compileTestModule (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1351:14)\r\n            at R3TestBedCompiler.finalize (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:935:14)\r\n            at TestBedRender3.testModuleRef (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1858:49)\r\n            at TestBedRender3.inject (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1781:29)\r\n            at TestBedRender3.createComponent (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1821:44)\r\n            at Function.createComponent (node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2020/testing.mjs:1660:37)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.0-rc.1\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.11 \r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.0-rc.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.0-rc.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThe main alternative I can quickly think of is some internal option that allows module to declare a standalone component in a module.\r\n\r\nThis internal option should be set by `TestBed.configureTestingModule()`:\r\n1. by default but this will not signal invalid declarations of standalone components for users who meant importing the standalone component.\r\n2. behind an explicit option `TestBed.configureTestingModule({allowStandaloneDeclaration: true})`\r\nDX wouldn't be great but can easily wrapped by commonly use shallow testing functions or libraries.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46110","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Standalone components are nearly impossible to shallow test\" (#46110)"},{"Id":"1245358745","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T16:35:59","Actor":"vilarneto","Number":"46108","RawContent":null,"Title":"[routerLink] does not get updated with Observable / async","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen `[routerLink]` is configured to read values from an Observable with `| async` pipe it only resolves to the first value, and only if a value is readily emitted at subscription.\r\n\r\nOther issues seem to report the same or related bugs (see #13865, #13075, #18469, #9825); unfortunately they were all closed without an actual fix and the bug is still present.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n(The resulting project is publicly available at https://github.com/vilarneto/angular-routerlink-bug.)\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Angular project with `ng new`. Add routing when asked.\r\n2. (optional) Strip the contents of `app.component.html` to:\r\n```html\r\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n```\r\n3. Create a test component with `ng generate component test`.\r\n4. Add this component to the routing table in `app-routing.module.ts`:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {path: \":id\", component: TestComponent}\r\n];\r\n```\r\n5. In `test.component.ts` create the following getter:\r\n```javascript\r\n  get linkRoute(): Observable<string[]> {\r\n    // [1] This one gives the correct link\r\n    // return of([\"/\", \"2\"]);\r\n\r\n    // [2] This one gives an inactive link\r\n    // (notice that the only difference is that the value is not ready at subscription)\r\n    return of([\"/\", \"2\"]).pipe(delay(0));\r\n\r\n    // [3] This one does create a link to /1 but does not update it to /2:\r\n    // return concat(\r\n    //   of([\"/\", \"1\"]),\r\n    //   of([\"/\", \"2\"]).pipe(delay(0)));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n6. Replace the contents of `test.component.html` with:\r\n```html\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"linkRoute | async\">Link</a>\r\n```\r\n7. Run `ng serve` and open the browser at `http://localhost:4200/1`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAt the end of the page there must be an active link to `/2` for all provided versions of `get linkRoute()` source code.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIf the return value of `get linkRoute()` is at version `[1]` then the link works as expected.\r\n\r\nIf the return value of `get linkRoute()` is at version `[2]` then the link is not active; in fact the generated `<a>` element does not contain the `href` attribute.\r\n\r\nIf the return value of `get linkRoute()` is at version `[3]` then the link is active, but `href` is not updated (it stays at `/1`).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/vilarneto/angular-routerlink-bug\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception nor console error, but the link does not work as expected.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.3.6\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.6\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46108","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[routerLink] does not get updated with Observable / async\" (#46108)"},{"Id":"1245413478","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T16:14:34","Actor":"leo6104","Number":"46109","RawContent":null,"Title":"unintended duplicate imports can cause rendering error in standalone component life cycle.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler-cli, compiler, core\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n   template: `\r\n    <mat-form-field>\r\n      <input matInput [matDatepicker]=\"picker\">\r\n      <mat-datepicker #picker [startAt]=\"startAt\"></mat-datepicker>\r\n    </mat-form-field>\r\n   `,\r\n   standalone: true,\r\n   imports: [\r\n      MatFormFieldModule, // It caused mat-form-field initializing error.\r\n      MatInputModule,\r\n      MatDatepickerModule,\r\n   ],\r\n})\r\nexport class StandaloneComponent {\r\n   @ViewChild(MatDatepicker, { static: true }) picker: MatDatepicker<any>;\r\n   startAt = new Date(); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeveloper expect that cause i use `mat-form-field` `matInput` directive so put MatFormFieldModule, MatInputModule in standalone component imports. But, it can cause an error for now. When i remove MatFormFieldModule in `StandaloneComponent.imports`, it doesn't occur errors. The reason is that MatInputModule already import-export MatFormFieldModule. It seems angular life-cycle handler trigger without duplicate check. Developers cannot consider all module+component dependencies when they use 3rd party library (it can be changed in the future). \r\n\r\nIt is not only NgModule-only problem in standalone component. I found it can be caused by  duplicate imports of `Component` / `NgModule` both case. \r\n\r\nDuplicate component imports can cause error too. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\ninstrument.js:109 ERROR TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'ngIf')\r\n    at setInputsForProperty (core.mjs:13015:13)\r\n    at elementPropertyInternal (core.mjs:12026:9)\r\n    at Module.ɵɵproperty (core.mjs:14906:9)\r\n    at MatFormField_Template (form-field.mjs:683:3057)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.mjs:11621:9)\r\n    at refreshView (core.mjs:11484:13)\r\n    at detectChangesInternal (core.mjs:12873:9)\r\n    at ViewRef$1.detectChanges (core.mjs:21935:9)\r\n    at MatFormField.ngAfterViewInit (form-field.mjs:460:33)\r\n    at callHook (core.mjs:2576:22)\r\n    at callHooks (core.mjs:2545:17)\r\n    at executeInitAndCheckHooks (core.mjs:2496:9)\r\n    at refreshView (core.mjs:11555:21)\r\n    at refreshComponent (core.mjs:12688:13)\r\n    at refreshChildComponents (core.mjs:11274:9)\r\n    at refreshView (core.mjs:11534:13)\r\n    at renderComponentOrTemplate (core.mjs:11601:9)\r\n    at tickRootContext (core.mjs:12864:13)\r\n    at detectChangesInRootView (core.mjs:12890:5)\r\n    at RootViewRef.detectChanges (core.mjs:21974:9)\r\n    at ComponentLoader.show (ngx-bootstrap-component-loader.mjs:125:65)\r\n    at BsModalService._showModal (mapiacompany-ngx-bootstrap-modal.mjs:500:1)\r\n    at BsModalService.show (mapiacompany-ngx-bootstrap-modal.mjs:378:1)\r\n    at TagEditModalComponent.openTagFeaturedModal (tag-edit-modal.component.ts:537:35)\r\n    at TagEditModalComponent_div_2_mp_button_3_Template_mp_button_click_0_listener (template.html:34:9)\r\n    at executeListenerWithErrorHandling (core.mjs:15474:16)\r\n    at wrapListenerIn_markDirtyAndPreventDefault (core.mjs:15509:22)\r\n    at HTMLElement.<anonymous> (platform-browser.mjs:459:38)\r\n    at HTMLElement.sentryWrapped (helpers.js:74:23)\r\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:406:1)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.mjs:26304:33)\r\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:405:1)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone.js:178:1)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invokeTask [as invoke] (zone.js:487:1)\r\n    at invokeTask (zone.js:1648:1)\r\n    at globalCallback (zone.js:1691:1)\r\n    at HTMLElement.globalZoneAwareCallback (zone.js:1712:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.0-rc.1\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.0 \r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.0-rc.1\r\n... animations, bazel, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.0-rc.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.0.0-rc.0\r\n@angular/material               14.0.0-rc.0\r\n@angular/youtube-player         13.3.1\r\n@nguniversal/common             13.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.0-rc.1\r\nng-packagr                      14.0.0-rc.0\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe use ngx-bootstrap modal to open these standalone component. \r\n```\r\n show(opts = {}) {\r\n        ... \r\n        if (!this._componentRef) {\r\n            this._componentRef = this._componentFactory.create(injector, this._contentRef.nodes);\r\n            this._applicationRef.attachView(this._componentRef.hostView);\r\n            ... \r\n            \r\n            if (this._contentRef.componentRef) {\r\n                this._innerComponent = this._contentRef.componentRef.instance;\r\n                this._contentRef.componentRef.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck();\r\n                this._contentRef.componentRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();

Ask in the official discussion thread: [#&#8203;1767](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1767)\n\n**Added**\n\n-   Added support for `module=NodeNext`, `module=Node16`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs` file extensions ([#&#8203;1414](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1414), [#&#8203;1694](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1694), [#&#8203;1744](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1744), [#&#8203;1745](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1745), [#&#8203;1727](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1727), [#&#8203;1717](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1717), [#&#8203;1753](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1753), [#&#8203;1757](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1757)) [@&#8203;cspotcode](https://togithub.com/cspotcode)\n    -   For best results, enable `experimentalResolver` ([docs](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/options#experimentalresolver))\n    -   See TypeScript's official documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html\n    -   enables mixed-mode projects with both ESM and CommonJS\n    -   enables all supported file extensions in TypeScript 4.7\n    -   Obeys package.json \"type\"\n-   Added ability to include file extensions in CommonJS imports ([#&#8203;1727](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1727), [#&#8203;1753](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1753)) [@&#8203;cspotcode](https://togithub.com/cspotcode)\n    -   Enables consistency with ESM, where file extensions are often mandatory\n-   Resolves from emitted to source file extensions ([#&#8203;1727](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1727), [#&#8203;1753](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1753)) [@&#8203;cspotcode](https://togithub.com/cspotcode)\n    -   Must enable `experimentalResolver`, will be enabled by default in a future version ([docs](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/options#experimentalresolver))\n    -   Typechecker requires importing the *emitted* file extension; ts-node resolves correctly to the *source* file.  E.g. `import \"./foo.js\"` will execute `foo.ts` See also: [TypeScript issue #&#8203;37582](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37582)\n    -   If typechecking is disabled, you can also use *source* file extensions.  E.g. `import \"./foo.ts\"`\n-   Added `experimentalSpecifierResolution` ([#&#8203;1727](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1727), [#&#8203;1753](https://togithub.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1753)) [@&#8203;cspotcode](https://togithub.com/cspotcode)\n    -

Users can't select / see the available migrations with their details before executing `ng update`\n2. Optional migrations that may be available won't be executed and listed. In fact users that doesn't know about such probably very helpful but optional migrations aren't able to find and execute them.\n\nOne example for this which can be found at update.angular.io only when selecting 'medium' or 'advanced' option:\n\n```bash\nng update @angular/cli@12 --migrate-only production-by-default\n```\n\nIdentifying and executing such optional migrations can be tricky if there isn't a way to list/select them.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally during the execution, `ng update` should list the migrations with their default execution state and also include all available optional migrations with a non-preselected state like this:\n\n```bash\n> ng update\nWhich migrations do you want to execute:\n[x] migration1Name: migration1Description\n[x] migration2Name: migration1Description\n[ ] optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\n```\n\nAfter a user made the selection, all selected migrations will be executed including the selected optional ones.\nThis will cause a better developer experience as it's more clear what will happen during the update process before actually running the migrations.\n\nIt should be considered, that tools like renovate or dependabot can't handle such interactive selections.\nTherefore a flag could be helpful to deactivate the prompt and switch back to the current behavior (only executing the pre-selected non-optional migrations):\n\n```bash\nng update --no-interactive\n```\n\nAs users may have already executed migrations previously or want to know what migrations are available at another point of time, a separate migration command/option could be helpful:\n\n```bash\n> ng update --list-migrations\n- migration1Name: migration1Description\n- migration2Name: migration1Description\n- optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\n\nTo execute a migration run: ng update --migrate-only <migration-name>\n```\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAn alternative would be to implement a \"small\" solution that would at least list possible optional migrations at the end of the `ng update` log to give users a hint about possibly further migration they can execute manually\n\n```bash\n> ng update\n\n...\n\nFurther optional migrations are available:\n\n- migration1Name: migration1Description\n- migration2Name: migration1Description\n- optionalMigration1Name: optionalMigration1Description\n\nTo execute a migration run: ng update --migrate-only <migration-name>\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"List available migrations and let users choose on `ng update` (including optional migrations)\" (#23205)"},{"Id":"1243889349","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T17:12:24","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"23192","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/upload-artifact action to v3.1.0","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/upload-artifact](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact) | action | minor | `v3.0.0` -> `v3.1.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/upload-artifact</summary>\n\n### [`v3.1.0`](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/releases/tag/v3.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Bump [@&#8203;actions/artifact](https://togithub.com/actions/artifact) to v1.1.0 ([https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/327](https://togithub.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/327))\n    -   Adds checksum headers on artifact upload ([https://github.com/actions/toolkit/pull/1095](https://togithub.com/actions/toolkit/pull/1095)) ([https://github.com/actions/toolkit/pull/1063](https://togithub.com/actions/toolkit/pull/1063))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I have done too little for it to be possible that I've done something wrong. And if I did, the error is not telling me what it was. \r\n- This is preventing me from seeing the output that tells me what port the server is listening to, so I don't even know whether or not it's working regardless of the error\r\n- flooding the terminal with this many repetitions of the same error is stupid\r\n- the error message is unclear. What is `, watch /path/to/file` supposed to mean? Is that an imperative? Are you telling me to watch that file? What do you mean by that? Or does it mean that there were already too many files open _while attempting to_ watch that file (whatever that means)? Because there's no way the message conveys that, but my previous interpretation is so nonsensical that I'm trying to second-guess it.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWatchpack Error (watcher): Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch '/home/teo/...../node_modules/typescript/lib'\r\nWatchpack Error (watcher): Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch '/home/teo/...../node_modules/typescript'\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.3.6\r\nNode: 17.0.1 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.6\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis form REQUIRES to answer the question **\"Is this a regression\"** and there is no \"I don't know\" option.

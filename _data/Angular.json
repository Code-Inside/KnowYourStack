Let's use the example from the blog post and modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-foo',\r\n  template: `\r\n   <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"tpl\" [ngTemplateOutletInjector]=\"injector\"></ng-template>\r\n  `,\r\n  providers: [{ provide: 'name', useValue: 'Ariel' }]\r\n})\r\nexport class FooComponent {\r\n  @Input() tpl!: TemplateRef<any>;\r\n\r\n  constructor(public injector: Injector) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-bar',\r\n  template: `{{ name }}`\r\n})\r\nexport class BarComponent {\r\n  constructor(@Inject('name') public name: string) {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  template: `\r\n      <app-foo [tpl]=\"tpl\"></app-foo>\r\n\r\n        <ng-template #tpl>\r\n          <app-bar></app-bar>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n\r\n   `,\r\n  providers: [{ provide: 'name', useValue: 'app' }]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see `app` on the screen if you run the code. I expected `Ariel` because I provided the Foo component injector, which should be stronger than the App injector. If you remove the provider from the app component you will get `Ariel`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44791","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ngTemplateOutletInjector - component injector should be stronger the wrapping component injector\" (#44791)"},{"Id":"1113235732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-24T23:05:09","Actor":"atscott","Number":"44811","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): compute correct offsets when interpolations have HTML entities","State":"open","Body":"When parsing interpolations, the input string is _decoded_ from what was\r\nin the original template.

[`v0.14.13`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01413)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.12...v0.14.13)\n\n-   Be more consistent about external paths ([#&#8203;619](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/619))\n\n    The rules for marking paths as external using `--external:` grew over time as more special-cases were added. This release reworks the internal representation to be more straightforward and robust. A side effect is that wildcard patterns can now match post-resolve paths in addition to pre-resolve paths. Specifically you can now do `--external:./node_modules/*` to mark all files in the `./node_modules/` directory as external.\n\n    This is the updated logic:\n\n    -   Before path resolution begins, import paths are checked against everything passed via an `--external:` flag. In addition, if something looks like a package path (i.e. doesn't start with `/` or `./` or `../`), import paths are checked to see if they have that package path as a path prefix (so `--external:@&#8203;foo/bar` matches the import path `@foo/bar/baz`).\n\n    -   After path resolution ends, the absolute paths are checked against everything passed via `--external:` that doesn't look like a package path (i.e. that starts with `/` or `./` or `../`). But before checking, the pattern is transformed to be relative to the current working directory.\n\n-   Attempt to explain why esbuild can't run ([#&#8203;1819](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1819))\n\n    People sometimes try to install esbuild on one OS and then copy the `node_modules` directory over to another OS without reinstalling. This works with JavaScript code but doesn't work with esbuild because esbuild is a native binary executable. This release attempts to offer a helpful error message when this happens. It looks like this:\n\n        $ ./node_modules/.bin/esbuild\n        ./node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild:106\n                  throw new Error(`\n                  ^\n\n        Error:\n        You installed esbuild on another platform than the one you're currently using.\n        This won't work because esbuild is written with native code and needs to\n        install a platform-specific binary executable.\n\n        Specifically the \"esbuild-linux-arm64\" package is present but this platform\n        needs the \"esbuild-darwin-arm64\" package instead. People often get into this\n        situation by installing esbuild on Windows or macOS and copying \"node_modules\"\n        into a Docker image that runs Linux, or by copying \"node_modules\" between\n        Windows and WSL environments.\n\n        If you are installing with npm, you can try not copying the \"node_modules\"\n        directory when you copy the files over, and running \"npm ci\" or \"npm install\"\n        on the destination platform after the copy. Or you could consider using yarn\n        instead which has built-in support for installing a package on multiple\n        platforms simultaneously.\n\n        If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both this platform and the\n        other platform in your \".yarnrc.yml\" file using the \"supportedArchitectures\"\n        feature: https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures\n        Keep in mind that this means multiple copies of esbuild will be present.\n\n        Another alternative is to use the \"esbuild-wasm\" package instead, which works\n        the same way on all platforms. But it comes with a heavy performance cost and\n        can sometimes be 10x slower than the \"esbuild\" package, so you may also not\n        want to do that.\n\n            at generateBinPath (./node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild:106:17)\n            at Object.<anonymous> (./node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild:161:39)\n            at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1101:14)\n            at Object.Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1153:10)\n            at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:981:32)\n            at Function.Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:822:12)\n            at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:81:12)\n            at node:internal/main/run_main_module:17:47\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve</summary>\n\n### [`v1.22.0`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.1...v1.22.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.1...v1.22.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.5.0`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.4.0...v5.5.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n-   Upgrade [@&#8203;verdaccio-ui-theme](https://togithub.com/verdaccio-ui-theme)  ([d36b8b1](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/d36b8b1e00ed4180424af160dcf0d53697d8a905))\n-   Use backward compatible UI from v6 on v5 ([#&#8203;2912](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/2912)) ([b79266d](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b79266d54e7310ed879e80e0beda95ebbeb2470c))\n-   Update dependencies, include 🔒 security flagged ones.\n\n##### Web User Interface Improvements\n\nThe current user interface for this version is exactly the same used on the next major release, the [verdaccio/ui](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/ui) **repository has been archived**, one single UI is much easier to maintain and also to share features between the future major release and the stable one.\n\nThe translations were migrated from the source code to the [crowdin platform](https://translate.verdaccio.org/) for the User interface which ensure repeated words are not translated twice and also crowding provides a nice interface for contributions, the latest translations are pulled on every release automcatically.\n\n-   Add new options to the web disable login and pkg managers ([#&#8203;2947](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/2947)) ([1a7b1ee](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/1a7b1ee8ad79c0a164f8bae7160b55919c18c0f1))\n\n    -

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel</summary>\n\n### [`v7.16.11`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/releases/v7.16.11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.16.10...v7.16.11)\n\n#### v7.16.11 (2022-01-20)\n\nThis empty releases force-publishes a new version of `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods` (which was not published in v7.16.10 because it didn't have any actual change) and of `@babel/preset-env`.\n\nThis solves [an incompatibility](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/pull/14169#issuecomment-1016948723) between `@babel/preset-env@7.16.10` and `@babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin@7.16.7`, by making sure that `@babel/preset-env` transitively depends on `@babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin@^7.16.10`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v10.2.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1021-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribcopy-webpack-plugincomparev1020v1021-2022-01-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/compare/v10.2.0...v10.2.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.12`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01412)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.11...v0.14.12)\n\n-   Ignore invalid `@import` rules in CSS ([#&#8203;1946](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1946))\n\n    In CSS, `@import` rules must come first before any other kind of rule (except for `@charset` rules). Previously esbuild would warn about incorrectly ordered `@import` rules and then hoist them to the top of the file. This broke people who wrote invalid `@import` rules in the middle of their files and then relied on them being ignored. With this release, esbuild will now ignore invalid `@import` rules and pass them through unmodified. This more accurately follows the CSS specification. Note that this behavior differs from other tools like Parcel, which does hoist CSS `@import` rules.\n\n-   Print invalid CSS differently ([#&#8203;1947](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1947))\n\n    This changes how esbuild prints nested `@import` statements that are missing a trailing `;`, which is invalid CSS. The result is still partially invalid CSS, but now printed in a better-looking way:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .bad { @&#8203;import url(\"other\") }\n    .red { background: red; }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    .bad{@&#8203;import url(other) } .red{background: red;}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    .bad{@&#8203;import url(other);}.red{background:red}\n    ```\n\n-   Warn about CSS nesting syntax ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    There's a proposed [CSS syntax for nesting rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/) using the `&` selector, but it's not currently implemented in any browser. Previously esbuild silently passed the syntax through untransformed. With this release, esbuild will now warn when you use nesting syntax with a `--target=` setting that includes a browser.\n\n-   Warn about `}` and `>` inside JSX elements\n\n    The `}` and `>` characters are invalid inside JSX elements according to [the JSX specification](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) because they commonly result from typos like these that are hard to catch in code reviews:\n\n    ```jsx\n    function F() {\n      return <div>></div>;\n    }\n    function G() {\n      return <div>{1}}</div>;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The TypeScript compiler already [treats this as an error](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36341), so esbuild now treats this as an error in TypeScript files too. That looks like this:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] The character \">\" is not valid inside a JSX element\n\n            example.tsx:2:14:\n              2 │   return <div>></div>;\n                │               ^\n                ╵               {'>'}\n\n          Did you mean to escape it as \"{'>'}\" instead?\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] The character \"}\" is not valid inside a JSX element\n\n            example.tsx:5:17:\n              5 │   return <div>{1}}</div>;\n                │                  ^\n                ╵                  {'}'}\n\n          Did you mean to escape it as \"{'}'}\" instead?\n\n    Babel doesn't yet treat this as an error, so esbuild only warns about these characters in JavaScript files for now. Babel 8 [treats this as an error](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/issues/11042) but Babel 8 [hasn't been released yet](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/issues/10746). If you see this warning, I recommend fixing the invalid JSX syntax because it will become an error in the future.\n\n-   Warn about basic CSS property typos\n\n    This release now generates a warning if you use a CSS property that is one character off from a known CSS property:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] \"marign-left\" is not a known CSS property\n\n            example.css:2:2:\n              2 │   marign-left: 12px;\n                │   ~~~~~~~~~~~\n                ╵   margin-left\n\n          Did you mean \"margin-left\" instead?\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve</summary>\n\n### [`v1.21.1`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.0...v1.21.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.0...v1.21.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This defeat the use of `@Optional` because in the end the injection isn't optional.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement a new `@Required(message: string)` decorator, the framework should be able to print the friendly message instead of the not friendly _\"ERROR NullInjectorError ... No provider for <token>!\"_.\r\n\r\nIf Angular is unable to do the injection, use the friendly message. The use of `@Optional()` is a [common pattern](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2f9a59a24c0464cbed7f54cbeb5cba73e6007715/src/material/sort/sort-header.ts#L202).\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using the proposed decorator is that the production compiling phase could be able to remove these message strings and use the generic message, in order to not add extra messages to the output.

Now, `_r3Injector.resolveInjectorInitializers();` is called instead and the actual creation of the `Router` instance is deferred.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it appears to be deferred to `initComponent` in `createComponent`, which is run inside of a zone with the `isAngularZone` property set to `true`: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8340da92bb75f62961d6cc99bc223a9138929688/packages/core/testing/src/test_bed.ts#L562-L567\r\n\r\nThis ultimately causes `router.isNgZoneEnabled` to evalulate to `true` (here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8340da92bb75f62961d6cc99bc223a9138929688/packages/router/src/router.ts#L582 ), triggering the warning when calling navigate.\r\n\r\nThe reason not including the `Router` as a dependency of the component fixes the problem appears to be because the initialization of the `Router` service is deferred to the `TestBed.inject` call, which is not inside an Angular zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/JoshuaEN/angular-14-router-unit-test-log-warning\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n`console.warn:` Navigation triggered outside Angular zone, did you forget to call 'ngZone.run()'?\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"Navigation triggered outside Angular zone\" warning in unit tests\" (#47236)"},{"Id":"1348393119","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T18:41:49","Actor":"sashaqred","Number":"47234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add possibility to update particular validator","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently in angular is tough to update validators dynamically.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a component with `FromControl` and `@Input()` which contain settings for some validator. The component could update validator settings by combining the cache of validator and manual call of `removeValidators` and `addValidators`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MyCustomComponent {\r\n  @Input() set range(range: null | {min: number, max: number}) {\r\n    this.formControl.removeValidators(this.currentRangeValidator)\r\n    if (range) {\r\n      this.currentRangeValidator = customRangeValidator(range)\r\n      this.formControl.addValidators(this.currentRangeValidator);\r\n    }\r\n    this.formControl.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n  }\r\n  private currentRangeValidator: ValidatorFn | null = null;\r\n\r\n  protected formControl = new FromControl();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor if there are too many such inputs, then it could be extracted to some function with a whole override of validators:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MyCustomComponent {\r\n  @Input() set range(range: null | {min: number, max: number}) {\r\n    this.updateValidators('range', range ? customRangeValidator(range) : null)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input() set required(required: boolean) {\r\n    this.updateValidators('required', required ? Validators.required : null)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected formControl = new FromControl();\r\n\r\n  private validatorsCache = {};\r\n  private updateValidators(key: string, validator: ValidatorFn | null) {\r\n    this.validatorsCache[key] = validator;\r\n    const filteredValidators = Object.values(this.validatorsCache[key]).filter(Boolean);\r\n    this.formControl.setValidators(filteredValidators);\r\n    this.formControl.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut both ways look complicated and probably have performance issues.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nPassing validators as object (`{}`) or `Map` and work with validators by key could be a better solution:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport MyCustomComponent implements ControlValueAccessor, Validator {\r\n  @Input() set required(required: false) {\r\n    if (required) {\r\n      this.formControl.addValidators({requiredValidator: Validators.required});\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Imaginary new function for deleting validator by key\r\n      this.formControl.removeValidatorsByKey('requiredValidator');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input() set range(range: null | {min: number, max: number}) {\r\n    this.formControl.addValidators({rangeValidator: range ? customRangeValidator(range) : null });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected formControl = new FromControl();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nPossible workarounds were suggested in the description","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47234","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add possibility to update particular validator\" (#47234)"},{"Id":"1348312468","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T17:42:03","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"47233","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(animations): fix stagger timing not handling params","State":"open","Body":"prior to this change the stagger timing was being built during the\r\nast building instead of dynamically when visiting the stagger animation,\r\nthus it could not handle params correctly, this change makes it so that\r\nduring ast building a timing ast is built instead and that ast is used\r\ndynammically to build animations which can handle params correctly\r\n\r\n(this PR reinstates the changes done in #47208 which have been reverted\r\nbecause negative non-parametrized stagger values were not handled\r\ncorrectly, alongside the original changes the current commit also\r\nhandles corretly negative non-parametrized values and improves unit\r\ntesting)\r\n\r\nresolves #19786\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Split up into the following commits:\r\n\r\n## refactor(core): generate initial inputs from inputs map\r\nWe have some logic that generates the `InitialInputs` data structure by taking the static attributes of a node and looking them up in the `DirectiveDef.inputs` map to determine if they correspond to an input.\r\n\r\nThis works fine at the moment, but it will make it trickier to generate the correct `InitialInputs` for host directives, because the `DirectiveDef.inputs` entries might be aliased under a different name.\r\n\r\nThese changes rework the existing `generateInitialInputs` function so that it does its lookup on the remapped inputs that have accounted for the aliasing process already.\r\n\r\n\r\n## refactor(core): reshuffle directive resolution logic\r\nThese changes don't have any functional impact on the `resolveDirectives` function, but they will make implementing host directives easier and will allow us to save some memory.\r\n\r\nCurrently `resolveDirectives` can be split up into two parts: directive matching (implemented in `findDirectiveDefMatches`) and directive application (implemented inline inside `resolveDirectives`). This will be problematic for host directives, because the logic from `findDirectiveDefMatches` will have to return two pieces of information instead of one: the list of matched directives and the host directive input/output mapping. We could make it work with the current code structure, but we'd have to return a tuple type from `findDirectiveDefMatches` which will consume more memory.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by moving the logic from `findDirectiveDefMatches` into `resolveDirectives`, while the directive application logic that was previously inline inside `resolveDirectives` has now been moved out into a new `applyDirectives` function.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47228","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Host directives runtime refactors\" (#47228)"},{"Id":"1347355941","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T07:41:01","Actor":"Dev-ashraf-ali","Number":"47224","RawContent":null,"Title":"string type variable asking for initialize.

These tweaks also fix `exports` map resolution with Yarn PnP for non-empty subpaths, which wasn't previously working.\n\n### [`v0.15.4`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0154)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.3...v0.15.4)\n\n-   Consider TypeScript import assignments to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;2468](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2468))\n\n    TypeScript has a [legacy import syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html#aliases) for working with TypeScript namespaces that looks like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    import { someNamespace } from './some-file'\n    import bar = someNamespace.foo;\n\n    // some-file.ts\n    export namespace someNamespace {\n      export let foo = 123\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Since esbuild converts TypeScript into JavaScript one file at a time, it doesn't know if `bar` is supposed to be a value or a type (or both, which TypeScript actually allows in this case). This is problematic because values are supposed to be kept during the conversion but types are supposed to be removed during the conversion. Currently esbuild keeps `bar` in the output, which is done because `someNamespace.foo` is a property access and property accesses run code that could potentially have a side effect (although there is no side effect in this case).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now consider `someNamespace.foo` to have no side effects. This means `bar` will now be removed when bundling and when tree shaking is enabled. Note that it will still not be removed when tree shaking is disabled. This is because in this mode, esbuild supports adding additional code to the end of the generated output that's in the same scope as the module. That code could potentially make use of `bar`, so it would be incorrect to remove it. If you want `bar` to be removed, you'll have to enable tree shaking (which tells esbuild that nothing else depends on the unexported top-level symbols in the generated output).\n\n-   Change the order of the banner and the `\"use strict\"` directive ([#&#8203;2467](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2467))\n\n    Previously the top of the file contained the following things in order:\n\n    1.  The hashbang comment (see below) from the source code, if present\n    2.  The `\"use strict\"` directive from the source code, if present\n    3.  The content of esbuild's `banner` API option, if specified\n\n    This was problematic for people that used the `banner` API option to insert the hashbang comment instead of using esbuild's hashbang comment preservation feature. So with this release, the order has now been changed to:\n\n    1.  The hashbang comment (see below) from the source code, if present\n    2.  The content of esbuild's `banner` API option, if specified\n    3.  The `\"use strict\"` directive from the source code, if present\n\n    I'm considering this change to be a bug fix instead of a breaking change because esbuild's documentation states that the `banner` API option can be used to \"insert an arbitrary string at the beginning of generated JavaScript files\". While this isn't technically true because esbuild may still insert the original hashbang comment before the banner, it's at least more correct now because the banner will now come before the `\"use strict\"` directive.\n\n    For context: JavaScript files recently allowed using a [hashbang comment](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang), which starts with `#!` and which must start at the very first character of the file. It allows Unix systems to execute the file directly as a script without needing to prefix it by the `node` command. This comment typically has the value `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Hashbang comments will be a part of ES2023 when it's released next year.\n\n-   Fix `exports` maps with Yarn PnP path resolution ([#&#8203;2473](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2473))\n\n    The Yarn PnP specification says that to resolve a package path, you first resolve it to the absolute path of a directory, and then you run node's module resolution algorithm on it. Previously esbuild followed this part of the specification. However, doing this means that `exports` in `package.json` is not respected because node's module resolution algorithm doesn't interpret `exports` for absolute paths. So with this release, esbuild will now use a modified algorithm that deviates from both specifications but that should hopefully behave more similar to what Yarn actually does: node's module resolution algorithm is run with the original import path but starting from the directory returned by Yarn PnP.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.6.2`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1362-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1361v1362-2022-08-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.6.1...v13.6.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   linting ([#&#8203;187](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/187)) ([cf1c5ed](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/cf1c5ed47810d98568cfdbd2c4b06b51e6fccd32))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Nevertheless, I wonder if there's really no way to mitigate the potential problems coming from it by throwing some sort of errors (at least at dev time). \n\nHere is a minimal example: \n```ts\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class Store {\n  private readonly state = signal({ value: 0 });\n\n  readonly counter = computed(() => this.state());\n  readonly frozenCounter = computed(() => Object.freeze(this.state()));\n\n  increase() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value + 1 }));\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    this.state.update((v) => ({ ...v, value: v.value - 1 }));\n  }\n}\n\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <h3>App</h3>\n    <p>Computed: {{ value() }}</p>\n    <p>Store: {{ store.counter().value }}</p>\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {\n  protected readonly store = inject(Store);\n  protected readonly value = computed(() => this.store.counter().value);\n\n  increase() {\n    // this.store.increase(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value++; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value++; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n\n  decrease() {\n    // this.store.decrease(); // ✅ correct\n    this.store.counter().value--; // ❌ wrong, but no error\n    // this.store.frozenCounter().value--; // ✅ fine: throws an error\n  }\n}\n```\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bqez6f1y\n\nA service acting as a store is just a popular use case, but essentially any signal having an object is potentially affected by the same problem. In all such cases, exposing / passing `computeds` or `readonly` signals don't make 100% sure the state cannot be accidentally mutated. At least, I'm not aware of any \"ng-way\" to achieve it. \n\nSo I wonder: would be freezing / deepFreezing signals something the team has considered? For example as an opt-in in dev mode... [as recently done by ngrx-store team](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1). Alternatively, any other suggestion in userland to address the problem? \n\nI understand this might favour a more \"strictly immutable approach\" to the data flow... and in general, it might make the signal implementation more complicated. \n\nI hope I haven't missed anything trivial (in case sorry). \nThanks a lot! \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThat I'm aware of: \n- Opt-in freeze / deepFreeze for all signals (at least in dev mode) + runtime errors, \n- expose a `read` / `transform` / ... option for signal / computed and cherry-pick the cases to freeze: `const state = signal({ value: 0 }, {read: Object.freeze})` + runtime errors, \n- purely at ts level (likely impossible => breaking change + I'm for sure missing something else 😅): \n```ts\n// freeze case, deepFreeze likely more complicated (if DeepReadonly possible 😅)\ntype Readonly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };\n\ndeclare function computed<T>(computation: () => T, options?: CreateComputedOptions<T>): Signal<Readonly<T>>;\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(signal): better guardrails to avoid wrong signal object mutations\" (#59287)"},{"Id":"2754729306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:13:56","Actor":"jossephus","Number":"59286","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page","State":"open","Body":"simple PR :-)\r\nIt fixes missing code annotation in  routing-with-urlmatcher page.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59286","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: fix missing code annotation in routing-with-urlmatcher page\" (#59286)"},{"Id":"2754724132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-22T16:01:39","Actor":"Meehdi","Number":"59285","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix mermaid polygon node text visibility in dark mode","State":"open","Body":"Fix visibility issue with text inside polygon nodes in mermaid diagrams when using dark mode theme to ensure proper contrast and readability\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Though there are a couple of higher level libraries for the web, I want to stick to the rather proven stack using Envoy (which we're using in other apps anyway).\n\nI've started with https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/tree/master/net/grpc/gateway/examples/helloworld example client.

The Service Worker is registered in Angular `main.ts` like\n\n```ts\n if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker\n    .register('/grpc-service-worker.js')\n    .then((registration) => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n      navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((sw) => {\n        sw.active?.postMessage({ type: 'INIT', ready: true }); // Initial message to the service worker\n      });\n    })\n    .catch((error) => console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error));\n}\n```\n\nHere's the `public/grpc-service-worker.js`\n\n```js\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n  const { type, payload } = event.data;\n\n  console.log(\"NGSW\", type) // doesn't get printed on built asset or non-localhost addresses\n\n  switch (type) {\n    case 'cpu_utilization':\n      broadcastMessage('cpu_utilization', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'cpu_clock':\n      broadcastMessage('cpu_clock', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'hwmon':\n      broadcastMessage('hwmon', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'stream_error':\n      broadcastMessage('stream_error', payload);\n      break;\n    case 'stream_end':\n      broadcastMessage('stream_end');\n      break;\n  }\n});\n\n// Broadcast data to all clients (Angular app)\nfunction broadcastMessage(type, payload = null) {\n  self.clients.matchAll({ includeUncontrolled: true }).then((clients) => {\n    clients.forEach((client) => {\n      client.postMessage({ type, payload });\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIn dev mode service worker does execute `console.log(\"NGSW\", type)`, but not in built/non-localhost addresses.\n|                                            |                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| ![dev](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmoazzem/guardian/refs/heads/main/gui/public/grpc-web-dev-ngsw-log.png) | ![built](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmoazzem/guardian/refs/heads/main/gui/public/grpc-web-built-ng-dist-logs.png) |\n\nNotice the grpc-web-client prints received data length in both cases.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/hmoazzem/guardian/tree/main/gui\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nservice worker in Angular doesn't seem to get (and console.log) events in prod mode, or non-localhost addresses in dev mode\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.5\nNode: v22.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm\nOS: Linux x64\n\npackage.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"gui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"watch\": \"ng build --watch --configuration development\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\"\n  },\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.0.3\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.0.3\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@electric-sql/pglite\": \"^0.2.15\",\n    \"ace-builds\": \"^1.37.0\",\n    \"echarts\": \"^5.5.1\",\n    \"grpc-web\": \"^1.5.0\",\n    \"ngx-echarts\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.0\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.0.5\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@grpc/grpc-js\": \"^1.12.4\",\n    \"@grpc/proto-loader\": \"^0.7.13\",\n    \"@types/google-protobuf\": \"^3.15.12\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"async\": \"^3.2.6\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.20\",\n    \"google-protobuf\": \"^3.21.4\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~5.1.0\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~2.1.0\",\n    \"lodash\": \"^4.17.21\",\n    \"ng-packagr\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.4.49\",\n    \"protoc-gen-js\": \"^3.21.4\",\n    \"protoc-gen-ts\": \"^0.8.7\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.17\",\n    \"ts-loader\": \"^9.5.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.6.2\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.97.1\",\n    \"webpack-cli\": \"^5.1.4\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59278","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"grpc-web works in dev mode and localhost only;

E.g.:\n\n```ts\nresource.set({});\nresources.reload();\nresource.set(undefined); // cancels the reload\n\n\nresource.set(undefined);\nresources.reload();\nresource.set(undefined); // does not cancel the reload\n```\n\n**Example reproduction**\n\nIn the following component, click the \"Load it\" button to trigger the reload, then click the \"Cancel it\" button to set the resource explicitly to `undefined` before the async load operation has completed.\n\n```ts\nimport {Component, resource, ResourceStatus} from '@angular/core';\nimport {JsonPipe} from '@angular/common';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [JsonPipe],\n  template: `\n    <p>\n      @if (something.value()) {\n        {{something.value() | json}}\n      } @else if (something.isLoading()) {\n        Loading...\n      } @else {\n        Load it?\n      }\n    </p>\n    @if (something.isLoading()) {\n      <p><button type=\"button\" (click)=\"cancelIt()\">Cancel it</button></p>\n    } @else {\n      <p><button type=\"button\" (click)=\"loadIt()\">Load it</button></p>\n    }\n  `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  readonly something = resource({\n    loader: async ({previous, abortSignal}) => {\n      if (previous.status === ResourceStatus.Idle) {\n        return undefined;\n      }\n      return await someLongRunningTask(abortSignal);\n    }\n  });\n\n  loadIt() {\n    this.something.reload();\n  }\n\n  cancelIt() {\n    // Setting a value after reload is called that is the same as the value\n    // which was set before reload was called does not cancel the reload action\n    this.something.set(undefined);\n\n    // whereas setting a different value to the previous one always aborts in-progress reload operations\n    // this.something.set({});\n  }\n}\n\nfunction someLongRunningTask(abortSignal: AbortSignal) {\n  return new Promise<unknown>((resolve, reject) => {\n    if (abortSignal.aborted) {\n      reject(abortSignal.reason);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    let timeout: number | undefined = undefined;\n    const abort = () => {\n      clearTimeout(timeout);\n      reject(abortSignal.reason);\n    };\n    abortSignal.addEventListener('abort', abort);\n    timeout = setTimeout(() => {\n      abortSignal.removeEventListener('abort', abort);\n      resolve({success: true});\n    }, 2_000)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59272","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Calling resource.set(value) does not abort in-progress loaders if the given value is equal to the value before the resource was reloaded\" (#59272)"},{"Id":"2753591884","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-20T23:14:34","Actor":"qbr-dude","Number":"59270","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adjusting the `ProviderToken` to `contentChildren`","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI wanted to do **general form management**: there is a component where it is pushed. Controls (**CVA**) are inserted through **`ng-content`** (marked through a directive), automatic button processing is immediately performed, etc. So I decided to get the components through **`contentChildren`** to link to the form, but it didn't work out. I tried different ways, but nothing.\n\n**In general, the idea is to access all the components through a directive search.**\n\nIf search only through the directive, then the result will be only the directive. Searching through the base class does not work (more on this below). In general, I had to look at the source code:\n\n1) I decided to take a look at why there is _no search through the base class_. [**I got to here**](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/di.ts#L700-L707), the tokens are compared here, and the values are really the ones I need. But the class token is compared with the inherited one (which is the target here), so the verification fails. Maybe there is an idea to add an additional basic check?\n\n2) And then I started going back up, and I got to ([**first here**](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/query.ts#L257-L268), [**then here**](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/query.ts#L503)], and I thought, why not pass **the `ProviderToken` array**. But **`contentChildren`** expects a single token, so I made a type cast via unknown. **And it worked**. [**Here is an example**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-vzdztjvv?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform%2Fform.component.ts).\n\nTherefore, it looks like **the type needs to be adjusted**. \nOr there is some other way, but I've tried, probably everything. Maybe you didn't think of such a thing, but I do not know why.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-vzdztjvv?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform%2Fform.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.0\n@schematics/angular          19.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59270","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Adjusting the `ProviderToken` to `contentChildren`\" (#59270)"},{"Id":"2753528496","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-20T21:51:03","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59269","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): tree-shake `ApplicationRef.warnIfDestroyed`","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we replace `private warnIfDestroyed` with a `warnIfDestroyed` function that can be completely removed in production.

However, when the same functionality is moved to an imported function in a separate file, the build fails with the error: **\"An error occurred while extracting routes.\"**\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**1. Create an API route directly in server.ts(works fine during build):**\n\n```\napp.get('/api/ping', (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  return res.json({\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    message: 'Ok'\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Refactor the response logic into a separate file, ping.controller.ts:**\n\n```\nexport default () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        uptime: process.uptime(),\n        message: 'Ok'\n      });\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**3. Import and use the ping.controller.ts function in server.ts(throws error during build)**\n\n```\nimport pingResponse from './controllers/ping.controller';\n\napp.get('/api/ping', async (_req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp: any = await pingResponse();\n  return res.json(resp);\n});\n\n```\n\n**4. Generate build using:**\n\n`npm run build`\n\n**5. angular.json config**\n\n```\n\"server\": \"src/main.server.ts\",\n\"outputMode\": \"server\",\n\"ssr\": {\n  \"entry\": \"src/server.ts\"\n}\n\n```\nI cannot move all the functions internally as all my routes rely on repository-based database queries, which are modular and imported from separate files. How to resolve this issue and ensure the Angular SSR build works with these imported functions?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

Even though `import` is normally a keyword that can't be used as an identifier, ES modules special-case the `import.meta` expression to behave like an identifier anyway. This change fixes the regression.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://redirect.github.com/sapphi-red).\n\n### [`v0.24.1`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0241)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.24.0...v0.24.1)\n\n-   Allow `es2024` as a target in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;4004](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4004))\n\n    TypeScript recently [added `es2024`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7/#support-for---target-es2024-and---lib-es2024) as a compilation target, so esbuild now supports this in the `target` field of `tsconfig.json` files, such as in the following configuration file:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES2024\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    As a reminder, the only thing that esbuild uses this field for is determining whether or not to use legacy TypeScript behavior for class fields. You can read more in [the documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#tsconfig-json).\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;billyjanitsch](https://redirect.github.com/billyjanitsch).\n\n-   Allow automatic semicolon insertion after `get`/`set`\n\n    This change fixes a grammar bug in the parser that incorrectly treated the following code as a syntax error:\n\n    ```ts\n    class Foo {\n      get\n      *x() {}\n      set\n      *y() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The above code will be considered valid starting with this release. This change to esbuild follows a [similar change to TypeScript](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/60225) which will allow this syntax starting with TypeScript 5.7.\n\n-   Allow quoted property names in `--define` and `--pure` ([#&#8203;4008](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4008))\n\n    The `define` and `pure` API options now accept identifier expressions containing quoted property names. Previously all identifiers in the identifier expression had to be bare identifiers. This change now makes `--define` and `--pure` consistent with `--global-name`, which already supported quoted property names. For example, the following is now possible:\n\n    ```js\n    // The following code now transforms to \"return true;\\n\"\n    console.log(esbuild.transformSync(\n      `return process.env['SOME-TEST-VAR']`,\n      { define: { 'process.env[\"SOME-TEST-VAR\"]': 'true' } },\n    ))\n    ```\n\n    Note that if you're passing values like this on the command line using esbuild's `--define` flag, then you'll need to know how to escape quote characters for your shell. You may find esbuild's JavaScript API more ergonomic and portable than writing shell code.\n\n-   Minify empty `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks ([#&#8203;4003](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4003))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now attempt to minify empty `try` blocks:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    try {} catch { foo() } finally { bar() }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    try{}catch{foo()}finally{bar()}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    bar();\n    ```\n\n    This can sometimes expose additional minification opportunities.\n\n-   Include `entryPoint` metadata for the `copy` loader ([#&#8203;3985](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3985))\n\n    Almost all entry points already include a `entryPoint` field in the `outputs` map in esbuild's build metadata. However, this wasn't the case for the `copy` loader as that loader is a special-case that doesn't behave like other loaders. This release adds the `entryPoint` field in this case.\n\n-   Source mappings may now contain `null` entries ([#&#8203;3310](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3310), [#&#8203;3878](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3878))\n\n    With this change, sources that result in an empty source map may now emit a `null` source mapping (i.e. one with a generated position but without a source index or original position). This change improves source map accuracy by fixing a problem where minified code from a source without any source mappings could potentially still be associated with a mapping from another source file earlier in the generated output on the same minified line. It manifests as nonsensical files in source mapped stack traces. Now the `null` mapping \"resets\" the source map so that any lookups into the minified code without any mappings resolves to `null` (which appears as the output file in stack traces) instead of the incorrect source file.\n\n    This change shouldn't affect anything in most situations. I'm only mentioning it in the release notes in case it introduces a bug with source mapping. It's part of a work-in-progress future feature that will let you omit certain unimportant files from the generated source map to reduce source map size.\n\n-   Avoid using the parent directory name for determinism ([#&#8203;3998](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3998))\n\n    To make generated code more readable, esbuild includes the name of the source file when generating certain variable names within the file. Specifically bundling a CommonJS file generates a variable to store the lazily-evaluated module initializer. However, if a file is named `index.js` (or with a different extension), esbuild will use the name of the parent directory instead for a better name (since many packages have files all named `index.js` but have unique directory names).\n\n    This is problematic when the bundle entry point is named `index.js` and the parent directory name is non-deterministic (e.g. a temporary directory created by a build script). To avoid non-determinism in esbuild's output, esbuild will now use `index` instead of the parent directory in this case. Specifically this will happen if the parent directory is equal to esbuild's `outbase` API option, which defaults to the [lowest common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) of all user-specified entry point paths.\n\n-   Experimental support for esbuild on NetBSD ([#&#8203;3974](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3974))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now has a published binary executable for [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) in the [`@esbuild/netbsd-arm64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;esbuild/netbsd-arm64) npm package, and esbuild's installer has been modified to attempt to use it when on NetBSD. Hopefully this makes installing esbuild via npm work on NetBSD. This change was contributed by [@&#8203;bsiegert](https://redirect.github.com/bsiegert).\n\n    ⚠️ Note: NetBSD is not one of [Node's supported platforms](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform), so installing esbuild may or may not work on NetBSD depending on how Node has been patched. This is not a problem with esbuild. ⚠️\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve (resolve)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.22.10`](https://redirect.github.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.9...v1.22.10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.22.9...v1.22.10)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.5`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small605-2024-12-20-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v6.0.4...v6.0.5)\n\n-   fix: esbuild regression (pin to 0.24.0) ([#&#8203;19027](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/19027)) ([4359e0d](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4359e0d5b33afd6259a4dcef787cc2670e963126)), closes [#&#8203;19027](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/19027)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

These options can be passed by developers on the command line when invoking the Angular CLI.\r\nTo mitigate this problem, the `execArgv` option is now only filtered and used if the SSR import argument is present in the array.

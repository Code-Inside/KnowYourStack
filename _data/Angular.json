In addition, working on the zoneless fixture revealed oddities in the behavior of the zone-based fixture, or behaviors that we felt were counterintuitive. The most consequential difference is how change detection works: `detectChanges` goes through ApplicationRef.tick in zoneless while it is `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges` in the zone fixture.\r\n\r\nWe felt that running change detection through `ApplicationRef.tick` was important for several reasons:\r\n* Aligning application behavior more closely with the test behavior (almost all views are attached to application ref in reality)\r\n* Ensuring that afterRender* hooks are executed when calling `fixture.detectChanges`\r\n* Ensuring that the change detection runs again if render hooks update state\r\n\r\nThis change, however, has some noticeable consequences that will break some tests, mostly around how errors are handled. `ApplicationRef.tick` catches errors that happen during change detection and reports them to the ErrorHandler from DI. The default error handler only logs the error to the console. This will break tests which have `expect(() => fixture.detectChanges()).toThrow()`. In addition, it allows tests to pass when there are real errors encountered during change detection.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that errors from `ApplicationRef.tick` are rethrown and will fail the test. We should also do a follow-up investigation to determine whether we can/should also do this for the zone-based `ComponentFixture`.\r\n\r\nfixes #56977\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56993","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): errors during ApplicationRef.tick should be rethrown for zoneless tests\" (#56993)"},{"Id":"2405895586","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T18:17:49","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"56968","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): fix common module removal","State":"closed","Body":"This fixes the case that common module is removed on a second run of the migration.

The presence of the import attribute takes precedence over all other loading behavior including JS/TS and any `loader` build option values. This allows per file control over loading behavior. For general loading for all files of an otherwise unsupported file type, the `loader` build option is recommended.\r\n\r\nFor the import attribute, the following loader values are supported:\r\n* `text` - inlines the content as a string\r\n* `binary` - inlines the content as a Uint8Array\r\n* `file` - emits the file and provides the runtime location of the file\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this time, TypeScript does not support type definitions that are based on import attribute values. The use of `@ts-expect-error` or the use of individual type definition files (assuming the file is only imported with the same loader attribute) is currently required.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TypeScript `module` option must be set to `esnext` to allow TypeScript to successfully build the application code.\r\n\r\nAs an example, an SVG file can be imported as text via:\r\n```\r\n// @ts-expect-error TypeScript cannot provide types based on attributes yet\r\nimport contents from './some-file.svg' with { loader: 'text' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the development server and a file that is referenced from a Node.js package with a loader attribute, the package must be excluded from prebundling via the development server `prebundle` option. This does not apply to relative file references.\r\n\r\nThis feature provides the bundling aspects of #26575. TypeScript type definition support would provide the full feature set for that issue but is currently blocked on TypeScript upstream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28040","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/build): support import attribute based loader configuration\" (#28040)"},{"Id":"2408028960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T07:13:36","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28052","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The dropdown does not open or interact correctly on initial page load. However, once I resize the browser window, the dropdown appears and stays open, but I cannot select any options or close it. After attempting to interact with the dropdown, the entire application hangs, requiring a hard refresh to recover.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nReproduction:\r\nHere’s a specific example of the problematic dropdown within a larger form using Angular reactive forms:\r\n```\r\n<ng-container *ngIf=\"brands()\">\r\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\r\n    <mat-form-field appearance=\"outline\">\r\n      <mat-label>Brand</mat-label>\r\n      <mat-select formControlName=\"productBrandId\" (selectionChange)=\"onTypeSelected($event.value!)\"\r\n          placeholder=\"product brands\">\r\n        <mat-option *ngFor=\"let brand of brands()\" [value]=\"brand.id\">\r\n          {{brand.name}}\r\n        </mat-option>\r\n      </mat-select>\r\n    </mat-form-field>\r\n  </div>\r\n</ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, ChangeDetectorRef, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { EMPTY } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { catchError, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { ProductService, StorageService } from 'src/app/core/services';\r\nimport { IProduct, IBrand, IProductType, ISizeClassification } from 'src/app/shared/models';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-edit-product',\r\n  templateUrl: './edit-product.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./edit-product.component.scss'],\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class EditProductComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  productForm!: FormGroup;\r\n  // Initialization and methods...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\nI recently removed zone.js and switched to using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush. Before these changes, my project worked well. Here’s how my main.ts is configured:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n  enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, { ngZone: 'noop' })\r\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n```\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nI discovered that this might be a known issue with Angular Material when running in a zoneless configuration.

Thank you for your assistance.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Angular Material dropdown should open, allow selection of options, and close properly on initial page load without needing to resize the browser window. The application should not hang after interacting with the dropdown.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Angular Material dropdown does not open or display on initial load.\r\nResizing the browser window causes the dropdown to appear and stay open.\r\nOnce open, I cannot select any options or close the dropdown.\r\nClicking on the dropdown or trying other interactions causes the entire app to hang.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular: 18.1.0\r\nAngular Material: 18.1.0\r\nAngular CDK: 18.1.0\r\nng-bootstrap: 17.0.0\r\nTypeScript: 5.5.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29432","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(material/select): Dropdown not interactive in zoneless Angular 18 until browser resize\" (#29432)"},{"Id":"2407550606","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-14T18:37:18","Actor":"whynotavailable","Number":"29431","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Theming Angular Material): theme overrides vs css variables","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThere exists seemingly two ways to implement MDC (or MAT) tokens in scss.

Also I have a master checkbox to select everything in the current filter scope. To support large datasets I also have an option for `virtual scrolling`.\r\n\r\nSince I allow filtering, the source set of the list is constantly changing which clears the selection if an option is filtered out. To prevent this, I use the angular `SelectionModel` and the callbacks of the mat-list-options. But here is the problem:\r\n\r\nSince the options are destroyed and recreated while scrolling through the viewport, the `selectedChange` event of the option is triggered with the initial unselected state of an option, so an option deselects itself when being recreated. But since this does not happen all the time, it seems there is a race between `(selectedChange)` and `[selected]`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-iidbcx\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Trigger the master check-box\r\n2. scroll\r\n3. see the master changes to indeterminate since check-boxes deselect themself\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the inital `selected = false` when creating the component is not emitted as an event\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInital `selected = false` when creating the component is emitted as an event and selected itself. But not always --> race\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.0.7\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.6\r\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, common, compiler\r\n... compiler-cli, core, forms, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-selection-list): mat-list-option deselecting itself when recreated in virtual-scroll-viewport\" (#29426)"},{"Id":"2403689410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T21:54:42","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29423","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update getting started","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the Getting Started guide:\r\n- Change links from angular.io to angular.dev\r\n- Update guidance on importing the components (default to standalone guidance)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29423","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update getting started\" (#29423)"},{"Id":"2404074340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T20:36:37","Actor":"urugator","Number":"29425","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/coercion): `coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` has invalid implementation or signature","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` works the same way as `coerceNumberProperty(thing)`, so it yields `0` if the `thing` isn't coercible to number.

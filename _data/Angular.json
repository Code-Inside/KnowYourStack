This is confusing and might cause subtle bugs (see for example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bvs1rn?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\nAn additional consideration is to not expose `.subscribe` publicly. Conceptually aligning with signal inputs,\r\nwhere you can only write to outputs, while subscription is only possible for consumers via the template. A difficult question will be dynamically created components as those currently have no way to subscribe, unlike with signal inputs where users could reach for `ComponentRef#setInput`.

In the last comment linked, it was said that 'By keeping the ivy internals private we can be more agile going forward.' Does the same situation still apply in 16+? Must we have no API such that full Ivy may be used when publishing libraries?\r\n\r\nIf all libraries must be compiled in `partial` mode forever, `full` mode being only available through workarounds, why are there multiple modes? Why make an option available if it will never be allowed?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis is more of a question than a critique. Ivy compilation was obviously designed to be more efficient, so if possible, the option should be made available.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`partial` mode can be used in perpetuity.

The development server now has a specific `prebundle` option to allow more control over prebundling while still allowing other forms of caching within the Angular CLI. The `prebundle` option can be a boolean value of `true` or `false` that will enable or disable prebundling, respectively. Additionally, the option also has an object long-form. This long-form enables prebundling and currently contains one property named `exclude`. The `exclude` property supports cases where a package should not be prebundled and rather should be bundled directly into the application code. These cases are not common but can happen based on project specific requirements. If the `prebundle` option is enabled when using the `browser` builder or any other Webpack-based builder, it will be ignored as the Webpack-based development server does not contain such functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow control of Vite-based development server

I prepared a simple repo here: https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss . The crucial part is here https://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss/blob/master/src/app/scss/utils.scss .`utils.css` is file that is being imported into `app.component.scss`. Relative path from `utils.scss` to `angular.png` is `../../angular.png` and when it is directly used inside `url()` function, it works. However if i define SCSS variable with the same path-value I'm getting error (path can't be resolved), also when it is changed to path relative to app.component.scss (`../angular.png`) it works again. \r\n\r\nIs the new behaviour intentional? \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/piozygmunt/angular-scss\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Path declared in SCSS variable is incorrectly resolved\" (#27007)"},{"Id":"2108979638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-31T16:51:03","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27000","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support using custom postcss configuration with application builder","State":"closed","Body":"When using the `application` builder, the usage of a custom postcss configuration is now supported. The builder will automatically detect and use specific postcss configuration files if present in either the project root directory or the workspace root. Files present in the project root will have priority over a workspace root file. If using a custom postcss configuration file, the automatic tailwind integration will be disabled. To use both a custom postcss configuration and tailwind, the tailwind setup must be included in the custom postcss configuration file.\r\n\r\nThe configuration files must be JSON and named one of the following:\r\n* `postcss.config.json`\r\n* `.postcssrc.json`\r\n\r\nA configuration file can use either an array form or an object form to setup plugins. An example of the array form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"tailwindcss\",\r\n        [\"rtlcss\", { \"useCalc\": true }]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same in an object form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plugins\": {\r\n        \"tailwindcss\": {},\r\n        \"rtlcss\": { \"useCalc\": true }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using a custom postcss configuration may result in reduced build and rebuild\r\nperformance.

Setup tailwind https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular\r\n3. replace app.component.html content with: \r\n\r\n`<h1 class=\"underline\">Hello Angular</h1>`\r\n\r\n4. create headers.css file with the following content:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@layer base {\r\n    h1 {\r\n        @apply text-red-100;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. import it in the styles.css like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */\r\n@import \"./assets/headers.css\";\r\n\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/142388200/90cc0587-2787-430b-8ff4-a004758e067a)\r\n\r\nNote: this worked without errors in Angular version 14.

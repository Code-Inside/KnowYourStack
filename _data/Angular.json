This results in `import(...)` expressions\r\nappearing in typings files.  For example in `@ngrx/data` there is a\r\nclass with a getter that has an implicit type:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport declare class EntityCollectionServiceBase<...> {\r\n  ...\r\n  get store() {\r\n    return this.dispatcher.store;\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the d.ts file for this we get:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nget store(): Store<import(\"@ngrx/data\").EntityCache>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that this file is within the `@ngrx/data` package already,\r\nthis caused ngcc to believe that there was a circular dependency,\r\ncausing it to fail to process the package - and in fact crash!\r\n\r\nThis commit resolves this problem by ignoring `import()` expressions\r\nwhen scanning typings programs for dependencies. This ability was\r\nonly introduced very recently in a 10.0.0 RC release, and so it has\r\nlimited benefit given that up till now ngcc has been able to process\r\nlibraries effectively without it. Moreover, in the rare case that a\r\npackage does have such a dependency, it should get picked up\r\nby the sync ngcc+CLI integration point.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37503","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ngcc): do not scan import expressions in d.ts files\" (#37503)"},{"Id":"635767383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-10T18:51:04","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"37515","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(language-service): Remove HTML entities autocompletion","State":"closed","Body":"This commit removes the autocompletion feature for HTML entities.\r\nHTML entites are things like `&amp;`, `&lt;` etc.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons for the decision:\r\n\r\n1.

This commit exposes this as public API as\r\ndevelopers already rely on this functionality but currently use\r\nworkarounds to satisfy the type constraints (e.g. `as any`).\r\n\r\nWe intend to make this public as it's low-effort to support, and\r\nit's a significant key part for the use of light-weight tokens as\r\ndescribed in the upcoming guide: #36144.\r\n\r\nIn concrete, applications might use injection tokens over classes\r\nfor both optional DI and queries, because otherwise such references\r\ncause classes to be always retained. This was also an issue in View\r\nEngine, but now with Ivy, this pattern became worse, as factories are\r\ndirectly attached to retained classes (ultimately ending up in the\r\nproduction bundle, while being unused).\r\n\r\nMore details in the light-weight token guide and in: angular/angular-cli#16866.\r\n\r\nCloses #21152.

While I don't agree with this magic, this issue is not about the presence of such behavior, but about its correctness.  The correct way to anchor a regular expression also includes **enclosing the contents in a subexpression**, which the current algorithm doesn't do.\r\n\r\n[MDN says about [pattern]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern):\r\n> The pattern's regular expression, when matched against the value, must have its start anchored to the start of the string and its end anchored to the end of the string, which is slightly different from JavaScript regular expressions: in the case of pattern attribute, we are matching against the entire value, not just any subset, as if  a `^(?:` were implied at the start of the pattern and `)$` at the end.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-j258mq\r\n\r\nAlthough pattern is `yes|no`, other values like `yes, and...`, `lol, no` etc. are considered valid by Angular.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nangular-cli: 1.0.0-beta.28.3\r\nnode: 10.20.1\r\nos: win32 x64\r\n@angular/animations: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/cdk: 7.3.7\r\n@angular/common: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/compiler: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/core: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/forms: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/platform-browser: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 7.2.15\r\n@angular/router: 7.2.15\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37501","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Validators.pattern anchoring doesn't work as expected\" (#37501)"},{"Id":"635229226","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T08:33:54","Actor":"kroeder","Number":"37500","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bazel: ng build --leaveBazelFilesOnDisk throws multiple errors","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nI don't know\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nRunning `ng build --leaveBazelFilesOnDisk` in an existing large Angular mono-repo leads to multiple errors. \r\n\r\n**What I did**\r\n- `ng add @angular/bazel` \r\n  - works as intended without any further configuration.

I have to kill the \"ng serve\" and relaunch it to be able to see the library changes  .\r\nWhat's weird is that when I made change in library, the app watcher still detects that something has changed somewhere and rebuild the app.\r\nAlso changes made in the library controller are shown immediately, only changes in html and css will not show, and needs a kill + relaunch ng serve.\r\n\r\nI've searched in the node_module/library_folder (which is a symlink) and I do see the html/css changes in the sources.\r\n\r\nI do have the  \"preserveSymlinks\": true property in app's angular.json\r\nIvy is disabled for now.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 9.1.7\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.6\r\nNode: 13.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                       9.1.6\r\n@angular/flex-layout               9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                  9.2.3\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   9.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.6\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

an object, you should change `new CopyPlugin(patterns, options)` to `new CopyPlugin({ patterns, options })`\n-   migrate on `compilation.additionalAssets` hook\n-   the `ignore` option was removed in favor `globOptions.ignore`\n-   the `test` option was removed in favor the `transformPath` option\n-   the `cache` option was renamed to the `cacheTransform` option, `cacheTransform` option should have only `directory` and `keys` properties when it is an object\n-   global `context` and `ignore` options were removed in favor `patten.context` and `pattern.globOptions.ignore` options\n-   the missing file error is now an error, before it was a warning\n-   the `from` option now can only be a string, if you use `{ from: { glob: 'directory/**', dot: false } }` changed it to `{ from: 'directory/**', globOptions: { dot: false } }`\n-   the `copyUnmodified` was removed without replacements\n-   the `2` version of `webpack-dev-server` is not supported anymore\n-   the `logLevel` was removed in favor the `infrastructureLogging.level` option, please read the [documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/other-options/#infrastructurelogginglevel)\n\n##### Features\n\n-

As context of how i got on this, I'm trying to do a merge between ASP .Net Boilerplate but replaing the front with ngx-admin.\r\n\r\nOriginal project uses only main tsconfig.json file in source. Ngx-admin uses tsconfig.json main folder and tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.spec.json in src folder. As well as tsconfig.e2e.json in e2e folder.\r\nAll was perfect until i started merging this files.\r\n\r\nSo, I created and attached a smaill brand new repro project: \r\n\r\nSTEPS TO DUPLICATE\r\n1. Download the attached project\r\n2. Run npm install\r\n3. Open src/AppPreBootstrap.ts file\r\n4. BUG: You will see that the import to AppConsts class does not work as @shared/AppConsts is not recognized.\r\n5.

This is the case for chromium on macOS, so when\r\nthe browser test inputs are extracted from the remote cache, the test action inputs will\r\nbe incomplete on disk, so that the later remote cache `SpawnResult` lookup for existing\r\ntest results fails with an IO exception (as an input file is missing on disk).\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why this doesn't surface with RBE then. This is most likely\r\n(not confirmed) because the remote containers are linux based, and do not fail writing\r\nthese paths with a space when Bazel opens a file descriptor through a JNI wrapper.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: This fixes an issue where chromium tests cannot be run in macOS.\r\nHence marked as P2 to unblock impeded local development\r\n\r\nRelated sources for later

I cound't find a way to determine when date range selection is completed via calendar selection. This is important for me to know this since I have two sources of date range changes:\r\n- custom header when user clicks on date range preset(dates need to be set according to selected preset which causes unwanted (dateChange) event to be fired on date input)\r\n- regular date range selection using calendar(preset needs to be cleared)\r\n\r\nWhen I use (dateChange) event on matEndDate input like this:\r\n```\r\n    <mat-date-range-input [rangePicker]=\"picker\">\r\n          <input [(ngModel)]=\"startDate\" matStartDate matInput>\r\n          <input [(ngModel)]=\"endDate\" (dateChange)=\"handle($event)\" matEndDate matInput>\r\n    </mat-date-range-input>\r\n```\r\nI noticed the following issues:\r\n\r\n- my IDE(IntelliJ 2020.1) complains about (dateChange) event: `Event dateChange is not emitted by any applicable directives nor by input element `\r\n- dateChange event gets fired twice during date range selection via calendar: first time with null value and second time with the selected value.\r\n\r\nsince dateChange gets fired whenever date input changes no matter where this change comes from I wonder if it is possible to have something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       <mat-date-range-picker #picker (dateRangeSelected)=\"handleDateRangeSelected($event)\">\r\n       </mat-date-range-picker>\r\n```\r\n, where (dateRangeSelected) gets fired when user completes range selection using calendar only?\r\n\r\nCurrenly I subscribe to calendar.selectedChange event and bypass this event through my custom header to workaround this issue.\r\n\r\n2. I do believe that class MatDateRangePicker<D> must support DateRange selection, but currently it allows only single selection which comes from it's parent class:     \r\n```\r\n/** Selects the given date */\r\nselect(date: D): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.1.9\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.0.0-rc.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome v83.0.4103.97\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 64bit\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19589","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"help(MatDatePicker): Implementing range date picker with custom header: problems and suggestions\" (#19589)"},{"Id":"636134307","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-10T10:31:26","Actor":"ahimik","Number":"19588","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDatePicker): Range end date fails to be set correctly when chaning end date value directly from component","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-9-material-starter-shtplo\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

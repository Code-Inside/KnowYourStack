(ExE-Boss)\n\nOther changes:\n\n-   Added support for `<input type=image>` submitting forms. (jenseng)\n-   Added the `location` setter to the `Window` object, which forwards to the `location.href` setter. Setting the URL is still only implemented for fragment navigations, however. (ExE-Boss)\n-   Fixed `defer=\"\"` `<script>` elements that are added after `DOMContentLoaded` to execute, instead of being skipped.\n-   Fixed `selectElement.selectedOptions` being incorrect when `optionElement.selected` is set. This was a regression introduced in v20.0.1. Unfortunately this also reverts the performance improvement when appending `<option>` elements that was introduced then. (eps1lon)\n-   Fixed the `self`, `locationbar`, `menubar`, `personalbar`, `scrollbars`, `statusbar`, `toolbar`, `frames`, `parent`, `external`, `length`, and `screen` properties of `Window` to be replaceable: that is, setting them will override their values, instead of having the new value be ignored. (ExE-Boss)\n-   Fixed a few issues with `JSOM.fromURL()` in the browser build of jsdom.

Determining this would require manual diffing of the router's current `ActivatedRoute` and the future `ActivatedRoute` of a pending navigation.  Knowing when a route might be deactivated by a pending navigation would make it easier to implement a [loading spinner](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/42489) during a navigation for only the outlets that would get new components. Knowing exactly when an `ActivatedRoute` gets deactivated would also likely make it easier to write resolvers which continue to be subscribed and publish new information until the relevant route is deactivated (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10556). There are almost certainly more use-cases, but these are the first two that come to mind and are some of the more upvoted feature requests.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd observables/lifecyle methods/signals to the `ActivatedRoute` and/or `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` that indicate when a route _would_ be deactivated by a navigation and when a route _is_ deactivated by a committed navigation (after guards & resolvers finish).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManually diff pending and current `ActivatedRoute` instances and children by writing similar logic to what's in [`createRouterState`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/create_router_state.ts)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48673","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make it easier to tell when a route will be deactivated by a navigation\" (#48673)"},{"Id":"1526243771","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-09T20:56:53","Actor":"EranKT","Number":"48672","RawContent":null,"Title":"npm install doesn't catch dependency with vulnerability CVE-2021-35065","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe latest version of compiler-cli (version 15.0.4) includes in the package.json the  a dependency \r\nchokidar version 3.5.1.\r\nthis package is dependant on the glob-parent package version 5.1.2 which has a vulnerability in versions prior of 6.0.1\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is not catch by the npm install.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cj88-88mr-972w\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI have tried to build to production without the compiler-cli but of course that it generated errors.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n\r\nThe compiler-cli is listed under the devDependencies in the package.json of the project, but when excluding the devDependencies from the npm install -

Starting with Angular 14 this changed. Now, I can still specify an option with this name in my builder's schema, but it must not have an `enum` property. Otherwise, the builder fails in what seems to be the `yargs` validation in the `angular-cli`'s `command-runner`. Note that there is also other unexpected behavior when using a type of `boolean` for the `target` option, which throws a seemingly unrelated error.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find anything regarding this in the changelog of `angular` or `angular-cli`, so it seems like it's an accidental breaking change. Instead of renaming the option in our builder(s), we figured out that it's enough to just remove the `enum` property from the `schema.json`, but eventually, it would be nice to be able to use `enum` again.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI prepared a reproduction repository [here](https://github.com/fischeversenker/ng-target-builder-option).

project (https://github.com/johncrim/repro-ng15-compile) - I've tried tweaking dependencies eg the typescript version and tsconfig setting to match my upgraded project, but no luck generating the failure. However if I move the same code into my project I am seeing the compile output described above.\r\n\r\nI have a fix (in tsconfig set \"module\": \"ES2022\" and \"useDefineForClassFields\": false) which is easy to apply, though I'm not done testing it everywhere. Since those tsconfig settings weren't changed by migrations I'm raising the issue for the benefit of the community.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24507","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng15 compiler output broken this in async field functions, with \"useDefineForClassFields\" unset\" (#24507)"},{"Id":"1521464737","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-09T19:58:42","Actor":"DariuszOstolski","Number":"24491","RawContent":null,"Title":"Infinite recompilation in ng serve","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAfair\n\n### Description\n\nWhen `outputPath` is defined outside directory(.e.g. ../public) where project files are located dev server keeps recompiling project even though no changes are made.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- Clone repository: https://github.com/DariuszOstolski/angular-ng-serve-bug\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/DariuszOstolski/angular-ng-serve-bug ng-serve-bug\r\ncd ng-serve-bug/client-workspace\r\nnpm install\r\nnpx ng serve --poll 5000 --verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nModify global styles.scss file.

The outermost parentheses were incorrectly removed for the following syntax forms, which then introduced syntax errors:\n\n    ```js\n    (/* comment */ { x: 0 }).x;\n    (/* comment */ function () { })();\n    (/* comment */ class { }).prototype;\n    ```\n\n    This regression has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.16.15`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01615)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.14...v0.16.15)\n\n-   Add `format` to input files in the JSON metafile data\n\n    When `--metafile` is enabled, input files may now have an additional `format` field that indicates the export format used by this file. When present, the value will either be `cjs` for CommonJS-style exports or `esm` for ESM-style exports. This can be useful in bundle analysis.\n\n    For example, esbuild's new [Bundle Size Analyzer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/) now uses this information to visualize whether ESM or CommonJS was used for each directory and file of source code (click on the CJS/ESM bar at the top).\n\n    This information is helpful when trying to reduce the size of your bundle. Using the ESM variant of a dependency instead of the CommonJS variant always results in a faster and smaller bundle because it omits CommonJS wrappers, and also may result in better tree-shaking as it allows esbuild to perform tree-shaking at the statement level instead of the module level.\n\n-   Fix a bundling edge case with dynamic import ([#&#8203;2793](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2793))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild's bundler could produce incorrect output. The problematic edge case involves the entry point importing itself using a dynamic `import()` expression in an imported file, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    // src/a.js\n    export const A = 42;\n\n    // src/b.js\n    export const B = async () => (await import(\".\")).A\n\n    // src/index.js\n    export * from \"./a\"\n    export * from \"./b\"\n    ```\n\n-   Remove new type syntax from type declarations in the `esbuild` package ([#&#8203;2798](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2798))\n\n    Previously you needed to use TypeScript 4.3 or newer when using the `esbuild` package from TypeScript code due to the use of a getter in an interface in `node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.d.ts`. This release removes this newer syntax to allow people with versions of TypeScript as far back as TypeScript 3.5 to use this latest version of the `esbuild` package. Here is change that was made to esbuild's type declarations:\n\n    ```diff\n     export interface OutputFile {\n       /** \"text\" as bytes */\n       contents: Uint8Array;\n       /** \"contents\" as text (changes automatically with \"contents\") */\n    -  get text(): string;\n    +  readonly text: string;\n     }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.21`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8421)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.20...8.4.21)\n\n-   Fixed `Input#error` types (by Aleks Hudochenkov).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.19.1`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/tag/v5.19.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.19.0...v5.19.1)\n\n##### [5.19.1](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.19.0...v5.19.1) (2023-01-07)\n\n> ℹ️ TS types were added in `v5.18.0` but weren't included in the package, this change might be a minor in some cases, if you have troubles report it.\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   include ts types and systemd into the published package ([#&#8203;3556](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3556)) ([a774e29](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/a774e2971528aaa59155f271595588d4c945840d))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Ts, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and.spec.ts files must therefore be manually renamed and changed.\r\n\r\nI frequently use the Angular CLI, and I believe that having this option would be useful since sometimes we merely construct angular components and then need to rename them. The produced angular component, directive, etc. must be deleted and the procedure to create the component must be executed again because there is no rename command.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHere is some additional commentary. It has the advantage of adhering to the newly developed style guide when CLI builds new components and other components. Maybe the style guide truly needs to hear this comment. That much duplication and naming is unquestionably produced. We receive N copies of each item's name across various folders and files when we add something using this tools, and we also receive N copies of each item's name in two separate ways. This causes a lot of friction when it's time to rename, which happens frequently in actual applications. There doesn't seem to be anything that can be done about it as it has already been decided that each name will be used twice as an official style (or more).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nIn VSCode, for instance, you can see error messages in the files explorer pane on the left when something is wrong (imported file that isn't there, non-existent component, etc.). Therefore, when I wanted to rename a component, I simply changed the names of its folder and internal files. After that, I simply followed all the error cues and changed the component's name appropriately.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24489","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Rename a component in Angular CLI\" (#24489)"},{"Id":"1520973517","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-05T15:56:31","Actor":"StephenFluin","Number":"24488","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tell users what migrations were actually performed instead of what was considered","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently `ng update` does  a good job of telling you which migrations the CLI is attempting to apply, but you don't know which migrations actually _were_  applied.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd love it if the migrations reports / logs actually logged what changes were made.

Prior to this, the release builds were performed using a custom build script that programmatically invoked TypeScript APIs. The Bazel build and discovery process for the releasable packages is performed by a script that is based on the scripts from components and framework repositories. Several small modifications were performed to match the behavior and structure of the cli repository:\r\n* Use of `packages` as the source root in the bazel query\r\n* Use of `pkg_npm` rule in the bazel query\r\n* Partial transition to native Node.js `fs` APIs instead of `shelljs`\r\n* Directory creation per package when copying output (supports multiple package scopes)\r\n* Copying of archives (tgz) for each package\r\n\r\nThe snapshot and local build capabilities are not modified as part of this change but will be merged in a followup as part of a larger transition to use bazel throughout the package build process.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24483","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: use bazel to perform release builds\" (#24483)"},{"Id":"1518375548","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T16:06:12","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24485","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v4.9.4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.9.3` -> `4.9.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/4.9.3/4.9.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/TypeScript</summary>\n\n### [`v4.9.4`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v4.9.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/compare/v4.9.3...v4.9.4)\n\nFor release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9).\n\nFor the complete list of fixed issues, check out the\n\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v4.9.4](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+4.9.4%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n-   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)\n\n##### Changes:\n\n-   [`e286821`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e2868216f637e875a74c675845625eb15dcfe9a2) Bump version to 4.9.4 and LKG.\n-   [`eb5419f`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/eb5419fc8d980859b98553586dfb5f40d811a745) Cherry-pick [#&#8203;51704](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51704) to release 4.9 ([#&#8203;51712](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51712))\n-   [`b4d382b`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/b4d382b9b12460adf2da4cc0d1429cf19f8dc8be) Cherry-pick changes for narrowing to tagged literal types.\n-   [`e7a02f4`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e7a02f43fce47e1a39259ada5460bcc33c8e98b5) Port of [#&#8203;51626](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51626) and [#&#8203;51689](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51689) to release-4.9 ([#&#8203;51627](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51627))\n-   [`1727912`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/1727912f0437a7f367d90040fc4b0b4f3efd017a) Cherry-pick fix around `visitEachChild` to release-4.9.

In [Enabled tab vs Disabled tab demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-4shdxw-rygzeb?file=src/app/tab-group-animations-example.html), when we place the focus indicator on \"Enabled tab 1\" and use left/right arrow keys to navigate, we can see that \"Disabled tab 1\" is bypassed. \r\n\r\nThis is fine for most cases, however, if there is a tooltip attached to the disabled tab which announces the reason why the tab is disabled, it would be hard for screen reader users to focus on it and read the message out. Because of that, [6.7 Focusability of disabled controls](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_disabled_controls) encourages developers to keep \"Tab elements in a set of Tabs\" focusable when being disabled, for the purpose of accessibility.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nWe expect disabled tabs to be keyboard focusable, in details, \r\n- We want focus indicators to render appropriately on disabled tabs with [appropriate contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum).\r\n- We should consider making similar changes to other components mentioned in [6.7 Focusability of disabled controls](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_disabled_controls) if applicable.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26395","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatTab): Allow MatTab to be focusable when being disabled\" (#26395)"},{"Id":"1525226840","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-10T18:12:18","Actor":"webmichelle","Number":"26387","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(theming): Custom typography not applied to all typography levels","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen defining a custom typography with `mat.define-typography-config` and adding a default font-family for all levels it won't be properly applied to all levels.\r\n\r\nI've created a reproduction in [this](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-2ejcd4?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts) Stackblitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a custom typography config with `mat.define-typography-config`\r\n2. Define a custom default font-family like so:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$custom-typography-config: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n  $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n  $headline-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-3:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-4:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-5:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-6:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 34px,\r\n      $line-height: 41px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $subtitle-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 28px,\r\n      $line-height: 36px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $subtitle-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 22px,\r\n      $line-height: 29px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $body-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 14px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $body-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 14px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n      $font-weight: bold,\r\n    ),\r\n  $caption:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 12px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $button:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-size: 12px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n3. Add `mat-select` with a view options to your application and wrap it in a `mat-form-field`\r\n4. Now the font-family won't be applied to the select's label and option labels.\r\n5. When adding `$font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\"` to every single `mat.define-typography-level` (like in the code below) it works.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$custom-typography-config: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n  $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n  $headline-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-3:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-4:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-5:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 42px,\r\n      $line-height: 46px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $headline-6:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 34px,\r\n      $line-height: 41px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $subtitle-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 28px,\r\n      $line-height: 36px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $subtitle-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 22px,\r\n      $line-height: 29px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $body-1:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 14px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $body-2:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 14px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n      $font-weight: bold,\r\n    ),\r\n  $caption:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 12px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n  $button:\r\n    mat.define-typography-level(\r\n      $font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\",\r\n      $font-size: 12px,\r\n      $line-height: 22px,\r\n    ),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe default `$font-family` config should be applied on all other typography levels\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe default `$font-family` config is not applied to all typography levels\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26387","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(theming): Custom typography not applied to all typography levels\" (#26387)"},{"Id":"1527154699","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-10T18:12:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26394","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): default font family not applied to custom typography levels","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes the following regressions with the new typography config:\r\n* After #25789, the top-level font family wasn't being applied to the individual levels anymore.\r\n* Custom typography levels were defaulting to a `null` font family while the default ones were defaulting to `Roboto` which was inconsistent.

Every new component created is automatically standalone. But, we still see 'standalone: true' flag in the `@component` metada, because its default value is false. So, what if the default value for this flag were TRUE and if the user wanted to create an ngModule component for some reason, he put 'standalone: false' in the metada?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA standalone component should look like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet],\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn ngModule component should look like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: false,\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though the standalone component boilerplate code is auto generated, is less code to see and it's easier to explain for new developers that is starting with Angular.

This solution does not seems very good, because when a user change language (and our translation pipe is fired and we correctly have our content translated), we have to re process all data and update the table datasource accordly.\r\n\r\nThere is a better approach?

This comes with a couple of problems:\r\n1. We generate template instructions for the blocks which ends up causing an error at runtime in some situations (e.g. block nested in a translated element.\r\n2. Blocks aren't shown in the extracted message string which can cause it to misrepresent the meaning since blocks can change the structure of the message.\r\n\r\nThese changes address the issue by fully integrating blocks into the i18n pipeline. Blocks are represented as a new node called `BlockPlaceholder` in the i18n AST, with the one exception being `@switch` which is still a `Container` while the separate cases are treated as `BlockPlaceholder`.\r\n\r\nIncludes the following commits:\r\n\r\n### fix(compiler): produce placeholder for blocks in i18n bundles\r\nWhen blocks were initially implemented, they were represented as containers in the i18n AST. This is problematic, because block affect the structure of the message.\r\n\r\nThese changes introduce a new `BlockPlaceholder` AST node and integrate it into the i18n pipeline.

A file with the defined extension can then used within the application code via an import statement or dynamic import expression, for instance.\r\nThe available loaders that can be used are:\r\n* `text` - inlines the content as a string\r\n* `binary` - inlines the content as a Uint8Array\r\n* `file` - emits the file and provides the runtime location of the file\r\n* `empty` - considers the content to be empty and will not include it in bundles\r\n\r\nThe loader option is an object-based option with the keys used to define the file extension and the values used to define the loader type.\r\n\r\nAn example to inline the content of SVG files into the bundled application would be as follows:\r\n```\r\nloader: {\r\n    \".svg\": \"text\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAn SVG file can then be imported:\r\n```\r\nimport contents from './some-file.svg';\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, TypeScript needs to be aware of the module type for the import to prevent type-checking errors during the build. This can be accomplished with an additional type definition file within the application source code (`src/types.d.ts`, for example) with the following or similar content:\r\n```\r\ndeclare module \"*.svg\" {\r\n  const content: string;\r\n  export default content;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe default project configuration is already setup to use any type definition files present in the project source directories. If the TypeScript configuration for the project has been altered, the tsconfig may need to be adjusted to reference this newly added type definition file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26371","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow configuring loaders for custom file extensions in application builder\" (#26371)"},{"Id":"1997321823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T17:00:13","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26381","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update Angular version to v17.1 prerelease","State":"open","Body":"Angular package dependency versions and the version used to generate a new project have been updated to use 17.1.0-next.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26381","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update Angular version to v17.1 prerelease\" (#26381)"},{"Id":"1997130387","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T16:08:52","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26380","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): normalize paths in ssr sourcemaps to posix when using vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nPath normalization that fixes a tests on windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26380","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): normalize paths in ssr sourcemaps to posix when using vite\" (#26380)"},{"Id":"1997102881","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T15:16:54","Actor":"toddhd","Number":"26379","RawContent":null,"Title":"File 'src\\main.ts' is missing from the TypeScript compilation.","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n16\n\n### Description\n\n I am running Node v18.17.1 and Angular 17 which I just downloaded yesterday.

Read the [announcement blog post here](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5)\n\n[![Announcing Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/og-image-announcing-vite5.png)](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5)\n\nToday, we mark another big milestone in Vite's path. The Vite [team](https://vitejs.dev/team), [contributors](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/graphs/contributors), and ecosystem partners, are excited to announce the release of Vite 5. Vite is now using [Rollup 4](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/pull/14508), which already represents a big boost in build performance. And there are also new options to improve your dev server performance profile.\n\nVite 5 focuses on cleaning up the API (removing deprecated features) and streamlines several features closing long-standing issues, for example switching `define` to use proper AST replacements instead of regexes. We also continue to take steps to future-proof Vite (Node.js 18+ is now required, and [the CJS Node API has been deprecated](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration#deprecate-cjs-node-api)).\n\nQuick

When we make a simple code change, it takes 280+ seconds for esbuild to rebuild.\r\n\r\nThe esbuild build story is GREAT. Working with esbuild and TailwindCSS on a daily basis is a completely different story.\r\n\r\nWondering what's possible here. The current situation is not tenable.\r\n\r\nFYI Before we used Nx's incremental webpack build and that worked in an \"acceptable\" way. If the change was in the \"top most\" part of the application, a rebuild was snappy. If the change was made in the \"lower part\" of the app, the dev server would have to work its way up to the top by compiling everything in between.\r\n\r\nYou definitely see a delay when having to pre-process the CSS in a larger application in comparison to an Angular app that runs with SCSS / Bootstrap for example.\r\n\r\nThoughts from the Team Angular highly requested 🍺\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n@vbraun said that it works fine for him with a static SCSS TailwindCSS solution here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25130#issuecomment-1814106769 but that the CSS doesn't get pruned.\r\n\r\nWondering if we can have TailwindCSS classes be configured to be pruned on a production build but use the entire TailwindCSS library during development (serve).\r\n\r\nIf we can define a development configuration that sucks in TailwindCSS in its entirety and a build configuration that kicks off post-processing of TailwindCSS in standalone component libraries and does the pruning, we might have ourselves a working solution.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: ✨ Improve Angular / TailwindCSS developer story\" (#26378)"},{"Id":"1996860204","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T13:30:11","Actor":"fengnian7","Number":"26377","RawContent":null,"Title":"Compared with the earlier version, the chunk-xxx.js file is added after the \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\" configuration is used.

just silently ignores the file replacements defined by the `ghpages` configuration.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe would ideally like to build our application using the following commands:\r\n\r\n`ng build --configuration=ghpages,fr` or `ng build --configuration=ghpages,moh` or `ng build --configuration=ghpages,fr` or `ng build --configuration=netlify,moh` depending on where we are deploying and how we want to configure our application.\r\n\r\nHowever, as has been raised in multiple other issues (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22424, https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11149, https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16688), merging `fileReplacements` across multiple configurations is not supported. \r\n\r\nI would strongly prefer (and indeed our entire team expected) the functionality to be as described [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16688#issuecomment-603714485). But, in the absence of that being supported - I think there should be a warning produced by Angular CLI since currently running `ng build --configuration=ghpages,moh` just silently ignores the file replacements defined by the `ghpages` configuration.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nCurrently we have to create different configurations for each combination which has quickly led to a dozen configurations in some projects which is frustrating to manage and not very DRY. I hope there is a better solution in the future, but a warning when certain configurations are being ignored would also be better than the current implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI should warn when configurations are being overriden.\" (#26361)"},{"Id":"1993299757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-15T08:05:38","Actor":"jsloyer","Number":"26357","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bring back --deploy-url","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nWith Angular 16 you could build your app with `ng build --build-href=/my/awesome/app --deploy-url=/my/awesome/app`, this was incredibly useful for SSR and Universal.

The explanation at https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23765#issuecomment-1225508049 makes sense for a CSR app but not a SSR or SSG app.  The docs mention using `APP_BASE_HREF` and `base-href` but those URI's together do not move assets like `main.js`, `polyfills.js`, and `styles.js` to `/my/awesome/app`.\r\n\r\nI understand if this was intentional but would love some documentation on a path forward here.

There is a `:before` pseudo element which has an empty string as content, and I believe the purpose of this element is to set the height of the title element with the `mat-dialog-title` directive.  Is this correct?  This implementation seems very hacky to me and flexbox `justify-content` does not work property because this pseudo element is considered an element within a flex container, and therefore the developer either needs to create a new flex container within the `mat-dialog-title` or remove the content from the `:before` psuedo element.  Am I not not thinking of this correctly and is there another way to use `justify-content` which works with this psuedo element?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the `mat-dialog-title` container is a flex container, `justify-content: space-between` works correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`justify-content: space-between` adds space between the psuedo element which has an empty string as content and the next element within the `mat-dialog-title`\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.10\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.9\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28129","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"hacky(COMPONENT): Dialog title :before psuedo element\" (#28129)"},{"Id":"1994762207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-15T13:17:04","Actor":"rpanadero","Number":"28128","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(theming): view encapsulation and theming own Angular components?","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nI don't find clear information about how to theme my own Angular components. I have just found this documentation: \r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components\r\n\r\nIn the next example, image I'm creating a custom carousel Angular component which has a theming scss file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel-button {\r\n    // Read the 500 hue from the primary color palette.\r\n    color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 500);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel {\r\n    // Get the headline font from the theme.\r\n    font: mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin theme($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, color) {\r\n    @include color($theme);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, typography) {\r\n    @include typography($theme);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n@use './path/to/carousel-theme' as carousel;\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n\r\n$my-primary: mat.define-palette(mat.$indigo-palette, 500);\r\n$my-accent: mat.define-palette(mat.$pink-palette, A200, A100, A400);\r\n\r\n$my-theme: mat.define-light-theme((\r\n color: (\r\n   primary: $my-primary,\r\n   accent: $my-accent,\r\n ),\r\n typography: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n    $font-family: serif,\r\n  );\r\n));\r\n\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);\r\n@include carousel.theme($my-theme);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach doesn't take into account Angular view encapsulation at component level since 'my-carousel' class styles are global after '@include' them in 'styles.scss' file. Therefore, if I use 'my-carousel' CSS class in some HTML element of my application, apart from 'carousel' Angular component, the theming is applied.\r\n\r\nCould you provide me with best practices to deal with this scenario?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, is it a good practice to use `mat-*` classes in component html? I don't find docs on this, so I guess not.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to everyone!\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28128","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): view encapsulation and theming own Angular components?\" (#28128)"},{"Id":"1994424572","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-15T09:51:07","Actor":"Burgov","Number":"28127","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Dialog): cannot use material components within dialogs","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOur application used to be an AppModule, I'm now rebuilding it to a standalone AppComponent and using the modern way of bootstrapping applications.\r\n\r\nI'm running into a weird issue though.

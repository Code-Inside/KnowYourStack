should point to a bloom filter` when using interpolation bindings on Kendo Angular Grid inputs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nAfter an upgrade to Angular 21, template syntax that worked in earlier versions now triggers an ASSERTION ERROR: LContainer must be defined.\n\nThe issue appears when interpolation syntax is used on component input bindings in the Kendo Angular Grid.\n\nExample that previously worked in Angular 20:\n\n```html\n<kendo-grid [kendoGridBinding]=\"data\">\n  <kendo-grid-column field=\"{{ 'date' }}\" title=\"{{ 'Date' }}\"></kendo-grid-column>\n</kendo-grid>\n```\nThe above will not work in Angular 21 unless optimization is set to true.\n\nThis will also work in Angular 21, but if you add a second Grid it will throw the error:\n\n```html\n      <kendo-grid [kendoGridBinding]=\"data\">\n        <kendo-grid-column title=\"{{ 'bar' }}\" field=\"{{ 'name' }}\"></kendo-grid-column>\n      </kendo-grid>\n```\n\nIf[ build optimization](https://angular.dev/reference/configs/workspace-config#optimization-configuration) is enabled in the `angular.json`, the error will not be thrown.\n\nExample where the error is reproduced and additional information in comment form:\n[grid-angular21.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24193447/grid-angular21.zip)\n\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nERROR Error: ASSERTION ERROR:

I have noticed unusual behavior during the initial page load involving application initializers and component lifecycle hooks.\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n* **Angular Version:** 20.x.x\n* **SSR:** Enabled with Client Hydration (`provideClientHydration()`)\n* **Data Fetching:** A required HTTP request is initiated inside a function provided via `provideAppInitializer()` (or inside the `AppComponent`'s `constructor`/`ngOnInit`).\n* **State Transfer:** Configured correctly (the client is successfully reusing the first server response).\n\n**The Observed Behavior:**\n\nOn a fresh page load, my logging shows that the root component's `constructor`, `ngOnInit`, and the `provideAppInitializer` callback are executed **three times** in the following sequence:\n\n| Execution Event | Environment | HTTP Request Made? | Expected Behavior? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1st Hook Run** | Server (Node.js) | **YES** | **Expected:** Initial Server Render |\n| **2nd Hook Run** | Browser (Client) | **NO** (Transferred) | **Expected:** Client Hydration |\n| **3rd Hook Run** | **Server (Node.js)** | **YES** | **UNEXPECTED** |\n\n**The Anomaly:**\n\nThe most confusing part is the **third execution, which occurs on the server again** *after* the client has started the hydration process. This third execution triggers a second, redundant HTTP request from the server, causing unnecessary load.\n\n* **Total Hook/Initializer Runs:** 3 (Server, Client, Server)\n* **Total HTTP Requests:** 2 (Both from the Server)\n\n**My Question:**\n\nIs this triple execution and the resulting extra server-side HTTP call a known issue, or does it indicate an incorrect configuration or a deeper problem with how I am utilizing `provideAppInitializer` alongside modern Angular SSR and Hydration?\n\nThank you for any insight or guidance!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32125","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular SSR/Hydration: Unexplained Third Execution of Initializer/Hooks on Server\" (#32125)"},{"Id":"3730422276","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T13:37:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32126","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/ssr): skip SSR processing for well-known non-Angular URLs like favicon.ico","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nSkip processing of well known non Angular files.\r\n\r\nCloses: #32125\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32126","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/ssr): skip SSR processing for well-known non-Angular URLs like favicon.ico\" (#32126)"},{"Id":"3724612545","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T12:10:06","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32118","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/architect-cli): remove unused progress bar functionality","State":"closed","Body":"The progress bar functionality within the Angular builders was not utilized, making the 'progress' dependency unnecessary.

If no element is active, it must be set to an empty string.\n\nCause:\nThe `aria-activedescendant` is entirely absent from the composite UI element.\n\nEffect:\nScreen readers may provide inaccurate information, leading to difficulties for keyboard and screen reader users in navigating and interacting with the component.\n\nSuggested Solution:\nEnsure that the `aria-activedescendant` attribute is pointing to the ID of an appropriate child element, according to the role of the composite UI element. When users navigate between children using the arrow keys, the `aria-activedescendant` attribute should be updated accordingly.\n\nSelector: mat-chip-grid\n\nHTML Snippet:\n```HTML\n <!--NOTE: snippet was trimmed due to its size--><mat-chip-grid _ngcontent-ng-c4270193721=\"\" aria-label=\"Fruit selection\" class=\"mat-mdc-chip-set mat-mdc-chip-grid mdc-evolution-chip-set\" aria-hidden=\"false\" role=\"grid\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\"><div role=\"presentation\" class=\"mdc-evolution-chip-set__chips\"><mat-chip-row _ngcontent-ng-c4270193721=\"\" class=\"mat-mdc-chip mat-mdc-chip-row mdc-evolution-chip mat-primary mdc-evolution-chip--with-trailing-action mat-mdc-standard-chip mat-mdc-chip-with-trailing-icon ng-star-inserted\" mat-ripple-loader-uninitialized=\"\" mat-ripple-loader-class-name=\"mat-mdc-chip-ripple\" mat-ripple-loader-disabled=\"\" id=\"mat-mdc-chip-0\" role=\"row\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"mat-mdc-chip-focus-overlay ng-star-inserted\"></span><span role=\"gridcell\" matchipaction=\"\" class=\"mdc-evolution-chip__action mat-mdc-chip-action mdc-evolution-chip__cell mdc-evolution-chip__cell--primary mdc-evolution-chip__action--primary\" aria-describedby=\"mat-mdc-chip-0-aria-description\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-disabled=\"false\"><span cl\n```\n\nComponent: undefined\nKnowledge Base: https://knowledge.evinced.com/system-validations/missing-active-descendant\nWCAG Violations: [1.3.1 Info and Relationships  (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)\nEvinced Severity: CRITICAL\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[Mat Chip Grid connected to input](https://material.angular.dev/components/chips/overview#chips-connected-to-an-input-field)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

The interaction with `mat-chip-grid` is happening not fully through the formControl. For now the source of chips's list is `keywords` signal, not the formControl: `@for (keyword of keywords(); track keyword) {`\nIt seems we should take the formControl as the source of chips's list (not the signal): `@for (keyword of formControl.value || []; track keyword) {` \nMoreover we could get rid of the signal, because the  goal of the example is to show the interaction between the formControl and the chips in the template. \n \n2. These two examples of `chips-form-control-example` and `chips-reactive-form-example` components duplicate each other. They have the same logic inside of components classes.

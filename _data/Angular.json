This option currently controls the extraction and emit of Angular class metadata. This emitted information is only needed in AOT mode when using certain TestBed APIs. However, AOT mode is currently not available for unit testing within the Angular CLI. As a result, the metadata is not used within CLI generation applications and in particular production applications. Without this option, the CLI needs to manually perform a code transform to remove the metadata and also replicate TypeScript's import eliding. This is can be a complicated operation and must be continually kept up to date with any changes to both the Angular compiler and TypeScript. The introduction of this new option alleviates these concerns while also removing several build time actions that would otherwise need to be performed on every application build.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a bonus cleanup commit that removes some leftover ngcc related code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50604","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): add internal compiler option to control class metadata emit\" (#50604)"},{"Id":"1745233575","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-07T19:47:22","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"50600","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): error when reading compiled input transforms metadata in JIT mode","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes an error that surfaced in #50580 where the compiler was throwing an error in JIT mode when reading the result of `compileDirectiveDeclaration`.

Generate a new Angular app with `ng new`.\r\n2. Configure a `proxyConfig` in `angular.json`, proxying for example from `localhost:4200/api` to `localhost:8080/api`\r\n3. Configure the backend server to respond with more than 8 kio of HTTP headers.\r\n4. Run `ng serve`\r\n5. Run any request that triggers the proxy redirection.\r\n6. The proxy responds with an HTTP 500 and an \"HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW\" error is printed into the terminal.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[webpack-dev-server] [HPM] Error occurred while proxying request localhost:4200/api/web/diffusion-requests/search?ascending=true&orderBy=scheduledDate&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10 to http://localhost:9002/ [HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW] (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 16.0.5\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                    16.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25334","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proxy fails when HTTP response contains large HTTP headers\" (#25334)"},{"Id":"1745056312","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-07T14:08:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25326","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c017652` -> `4e1eb40` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `70dd92a` -> `c2e740e` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `036f620` -> `93c1a42` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `511fb07` -> `bc78394` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `62eb87c` -> `88d1982` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `55f6512` -> `2ac34aa` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `46f593e` -> `51308b8` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `50b5053` -> `6e89a3c` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `902b08f` -> `b67bc7d` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ed593a5` -> `31cdae5` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fa999dd` -> `b2ed7e9` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7fea3db` -> `38e4374` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b0cc61e` -> `767893f` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `1ae11ec` -> `d3f6a92` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7402961` -> `d6e3b6d` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `4c1c9cf` -> `a7851d0` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, this is not an option for style files imported from `node_modules` which will usually include shorthand imports such as the one shown above (e.g. bootstrap).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to work around this issue? It seems that preprocessor options are only defined in `angular.json`, which means I would have to run the preprocessor step manually before running `ngc` to get this working?\r\n\r\n### Proposed

To compare use the methods .equals(), .compareTo(), .isBefore() or one that is more suitable to your use case._\r\n\r\nThis happen because  the code is using `cell.rawValue` at the following line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/1da7f15ff66ce30ad9888d56760bb149c960d2a6/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#LL515C40-L515C48\r\n\r\nI think it should be using `cell.compareValue` instead.\r\n\r\nA workaround can be made monkey patching `MatCalendarBody` (remember to use your date class check if not using js-joda)\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { MatCalendarBody } from '@angular/material/datepicker';\r\n\r\nconst originalIsInRange = MatCalendarBody.prototype._isInRange;\r\nMatCalendarBody.prototype._isInRange = function(value: number) {\r\n  const badValue = value as any;\r\n  if (badValue instanceof LocalDate) {\r\n    value = new Date(badValue.year(), badValue.monthValue(), badValue.dayOfMonth()).getTime();\r\n  }\r\n  return originalIsInRange.call(this, value);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI am pointing to the exact source line with the problem\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nUsing a custom DateAdapter for js-joda should work.

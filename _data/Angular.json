On one hand it makes sense, though in practice I see a huge risk of developers accidentally introducing too many immediate subscriptions bound to Env Injectors which will never get cleaned up:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntoSignal(myObservable$)\r\n```\r\nNow if the dev doesn't know all the quirks around injector hierarchy, they might not know that e.g. a service provided-in-root might get env injector which doesn't trigger `DestroyRef`. In fact, moving that code (since it depends on `inject`/`DestroyRef`) changes the semantics significantly!\r\n\r\nRelates to #51290.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// within a component/directive OR service provided in component/directive\r\nconst signal = toSignal(observable$) // ✅ no runtime error\r\n// no additional params needed\r\n// runtime check makes sure that a NodeInjector spits out a NodeInjectorDestroyRef\r\n\r\n// within a global service\r\nconst signal = toSignal(observable$) // ❌ safety error: Env Injector was used when only node injectors are allowed (whatever message...)\r\n// expected: toSignal(observable$, { onlyInNodeInjectors: false })\r\n\r\n// within a global service\r\nconst signal = toSignal(observable$, { onlyInNodeInjectors: false }) // ✅ no runtime error\r\n// the developer is doing it ON THEIR OWN RISK\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nThis _proposal_ aims to make potentially unsafe usage explicit (like with requireSync default is `false`). I.e. revert the current API (thankfully, toSignal is still within `developerPreview`) whenever **ENV injector** would get passed: from \"_implicit env injector_\" into \"_explicit env injector_\" (doesn't matter if node injector gets used).\r\n\r\nSlightly change the toSignal function signature and/or overloads.\r\n\r\nCurrent options:\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface ToSignalOptions {\r\n  initialValue?: unknown;\r\n  requireSync?: boolean;\r\n  injector?: Injector;\r\n  manualCleanup?: boolean;\r\n  rejectErrors?: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that specific `onlyInNodeInjectors` name of the option is less relevant at the moment... 😉\r\n\r\nProposed:\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface ToSignalOptions {\r\n  ...\r\n  onlyInNodeInjectors?: boolean // default true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRuntime check:\r\n- angular has internal access to all classes that represent injectors (env, node) or destroy refs (node)\r\n- depending on what is simpler (checking the injectors OR destroyRefs - ultimately it's all about destroyRefs anyway), use the `instanceOf` operator to find out whether the allowed\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// either injectors:\r\n- class NodeInjector\r\n- abstract class EnvironmentInjector / class R3Injector extends EnvironmentInjector\r\n\r\n// or:\r\n- class NodeInjectorDestroyRef\r\n```\r\n\r\nMechanics:\r\n- in compile-time we don't know whether the injector is going to be **node** or **env** one\r\n- the default (true) allows to only use node injectors, and since node injectors get removed along with components, the risk of memory leaks drops significantly\r\n- if devs want to go with env injectors, they shall do that explicitly.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n# 1. enum\r\n\r\nchange `manualCleanup`'s boolean with an `cleanup` **enum** with:\r\n- `NODE_ONLY` (default) -> destroyRef can be taken ONLY from node injectors\r\n- `MANUAL_CLEANUP` -> no destroyRef\r\n- `ALL_INJECTORS` -> (unrecommended) although both node and env injectors might be used to fetch destroyRef\r\n\r\nagain, better names could be provided.\r\n\r\n# 2. toSignal overloads\r\n\r\nupdate the overloads:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Base case: no options -> `undefined` in the result type.\r\nexport function toSignal<T>(source: Observable<T>|Subscribable<T>): Signal<T|undefined>;\r\n// Options with `undefined` initial value and no `requiredSync` -> `undefined`.\r\nexport function toSignal<T>(\r\n    source: Observable<T>|Subscribable<T>,\r\n    options: ToSignalOptions&{initialValue?: undefined, requireSync?: false}): Signal<T|undefined>;\r\n// Options with `null` initial value -> `null`.\r\nexport function toSignal<T>(\r\n    source: Observable<T>|Subscribable<T>,\r\n    options: ToSignalOptions&{initialValue?: null, requireSync?: false}): Signal<T|null>;\r\n// Options with `undefined` initial value and `requiredSync` -> strict result type.\r\nexport function toSignal<T>(\r\n    source: Observable<T>|Subscribable<T>,\r\n    options: ToSignalOptions&{initialValue?: undefined, requireSync: true}): Signal<T>;\r\n// Options with a more specific initial value type.\r\nexport function toSignal<T, const U extends T>(\r\n    source: Observable<T>|Subscribable<T>,\r\n    options: ToSignalOptions&{initialValue: U, requireSync?: false}): Signal<T|U>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto enforce passing the injector explicitly.

[`v0.19.11`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#01911)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.10...v0.19.11)\n\n-   Fix TypeScript-specific class transform edge case ([#&#8203;3559](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3559))\n\n    The previous release introduced an optimization that avoided transforming `super()` in the class constructor for TypeScript code compiled with `useDefineForClassFields` set to `false` if all class instance fields have no initializers. The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case *and* there are `#private` instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to `super()` (since `super()` is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      public: any;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.#private = 1;\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        this.#private = 1;\n        super();\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: allow reording a primitive past a side-effect ([#&#8203;3568](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3568))\n\n    The minifier previously allowed reordering a side-effect past a primitive, but didn't handle the case of reordering a primitive past a side-effect. This additional case is now handled:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f() {\n      let x = false;\n      let y = x;\n      const boolean = y;\n      let frag = $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${boolean}\">hello world</p>`);\n      return frag;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(){const e=!1;return $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${e}\">hello world</p>`)}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(){return $.template('<p contenteditable=\"false\">hello world</p>')}\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: consider properties named using known `Symbol` instances to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;3561](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3561))\n\n    Many things in JavaScript can have side effects including property accesses and ToString operations, so using a symbol such as `Symbol.iterator` as a computed property name is not obviously side-effect free. This release adds a special case for known `Symbol` instances so that they are considered side-effect free when used as property names. For example, this class declaration will now be considered side-effect free:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Provide the `stop()` API in node to exit esbuild's child process ([#&#8203;3558](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3558))\n\n    You can now call `stop()` in esbuild's node API to exit esbuild's child process to reclaim the resources used. It only makes sense to do this for a long-lived node process when you know you will no longer be making any more esbuild API calls. It is not necessary to call this to allow node to exit, and it's advantageous to not call this in between calls to esbuild's API as sharing a single long-lived esbuild child process is more efficient than re-creating a new esbuild child process for every API call. This API call used to exist but was removed in [version 0.9.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.9.0). This release adds it back due to a user request.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.69.7`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1697)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.69.6...1.69.7)\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   In the JS Embedded Host, properly install the x64 Dart Sass executable on\n    ARM64 Windows.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

My goal is to dynamically fetch specific theme configurations based on the individual hostnames.\r\n\r\nProblem Description:\r\n\r\n**Scenario**: I have multiple Firebase hostings (e.g., test1.com, test2.com) linked to a single Firebase project. Each domain should have its own theme configuration fetched from a database on the server.\r\n\r\n**Approaches Tried**: I attempted to access the hostname using methods such as `@Inject(DOCUMENT)` for the **Document** and **PlatformLocation**, but these only work on the client side.\r\n\r\n**Server-side Code**: In the server-side code (server.ts), I added Injection Tokens within the Angular SSR's commonEngine.render() method to provide request-related data, but the retrieved data remains NULL in the component.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular SSR application with Firebase Hosting connected to multiple domains.

That is to say if I edit the HTML file I'm viewing in my browser to add or remove some content and then save the file, nothing changes in my browser. I have not tried `ng build` to see whether it considers HTML/style changes to necessitate rebuilding the app.\r\n\r\nOn to my specific problem! I'm hand-crafting some SVG (excited for `@for`), and I'm editing files with extensions like `.html` and `.scss`, as well as `.ts`. I can reproduce the problem on `app.component.*`, generated via `ng new`. When I edit a TS file, live reload works as expected. If you look at my \"exception or error\" output, you'll see the following series of events:\r\n\r\n1. The initial build, which worked\r\n2. Me editing and saving an HTML file (notice the comment), which did not actually rebuild anything (apparently) or change the content in my browser\r\n3. Me changing an SCSS file, which did the same\r\n4. Subsequent changes to HTML or SCSS files simply do nothing, as you can see. I made several changes such as adding and removing lines to both the HTML and SCSS files and saved them afterwards with no effect.\r\n\r\nI suppose you could argue this is an issue with 3rd party software, not with Angular, but then again, isn't the whole point of Angular to provide a developer-ready framework? I contend that an app created with `ng new` should fully - not partially - support tasks such as editing HTML or SCSS files.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n❯ ng serve\r\n\r\nInitial Chunk Files | Names         |  Raw Size\r\npolyfills.js        | polyfills     |  82.71 kB | \r\nmain.js             | main          |  25.46 kB | \r\nstyles.css          | styles        |  96 bytes | \r\n\r\n                    | Initial Total | 108.26 kB\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation complete.

There were a few issues that broke hydration:\r\n1. There wasn't a catch-all `ng-content` slot which meant that the comment nodes representing the table content were dropped, causing an error.\r\n2. The table needs to conditionally wrap some content with native table sections (`thead`,  `tbody` etc.) which was done with direct DOM manipulation. This breaks hydration because Angular won't know about those elements.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is easily resolved by adding an `ng-content` element. It shouldn't affect existing tables, since all the projected content is composed of comment nodes.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is a bit trickier, because we were using content queries to resolve the individual table outlets. Wrapping them in a conditional breaks the query so we have to use something else to resolve them. I've worked around it by using DI which doesn't have the exact same timing, but it appears to be close enough.\r\n\r\nFixes #28355.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28356","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/table): support hydration\" (#28356)"},{"Id":"2062874647","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-02T19:53:34","Actor":"tsenguunchik","Number":"28355","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-table): Mat Table has skip hydration attribute","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI've noticed a lot of material components have ngSkipHydration attribute present such as mat-table. \r\n\r\nThe sidenav component fixed this issue recently in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28340 and I'm very grateful.

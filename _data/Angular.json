All has been working well. The new Angular components (downgraded) work fine in the AngularJS app.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot get the HttpClient module to instantiate.\r\n\r\nI have followed the doc and examples of this, but no success.\r\n\r\nThis is the full error:\r\n\r\nNullInjectorError: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]: \r\n  StaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]: \r\n    NullInjectorError: No provider for http_HttpClient!\r\n    at NullInjector.get (core.js:11545:27)\r\n    at resolveToken (core.js:12281:24)\r\n    at tryResolveToken (core.js:12226:16)\r\n    at StaticInjector.get (core.js:12121:20)\r\n    at resolveToken (core.js:12281:24)\r\n    at tryResolveToken (core.js:12226:16)\r\n    at StaticInjector.get (core.js:12121:20)\r\n    at resolveNgModuleDep (core.js:24381:29)\r\n    at _createClass (core.js:24430:29)\r\n    at _createProviderInstance (core.js:24400:26) '<angular-feedback-component _nghost-gam-c0=\"\">'\r\n\r\nYou can see that is is actually complaining about http_HttpClient, which is strange as most cases I have seen of this report that it is HttpClient. I am not using the http_HttpClient reference anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis is app.ts:\r\n\r\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    HttpClientModule,\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    UpgradeModule,\r\n    MatDialogModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    FormsModule,\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    FeedbackComponent,\r\n    UserFeedbackComponent,\r\n  ],\r\n  entryComponents: [\r\n    FeedbackComponent,\r\n    UserFeedbackComponent,\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [\r\n    UserFeedbackService,\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\nThis is the Angular service:\r\n\r\nimport { Inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\nconstructor(@Inject(HttpClient) private http: HttpClient, private dialog: MatDialog) { }\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient, private dialog: MatDialog) { }\r\n\r\nThe service works fine without the reference to HttpClient. It is not a problem with the service as if I try to inject HttpClient into the controller I get the same error.\r\n\r\nFYI, this is how the hybrid app is bootstrapped in app.ts:\r\n\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n\r\nconstructor(private upgrade: UpgradeModule) { }\r\n\r\n// Bootstrap using the UpgradeModule\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).then(platformRef => {\r\n  console.log(\"Bootstrapping in Hybrid mode with Angular & AngularJS\");\r\n  const upgrade = platformRef.injector.get(UpgradeModule) as UpgradeModule;\r\n  upgrade.bootstrap(document.body, ['angularjsApp'], {strictDi: true});\r\n});\r\n\r\nUsing Angular 12.2.16 and AngularJS 1.8.3.\r\n\r\nSpent several days trying to resolve this so any help would be appreciated.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nWill provide later\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNullInjectorError: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]: \r\n  StaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]: \r\n    NullInjectorError: No provider for http_HttpClient!\r\n    at NullInjector.get (core.js:11545:27)\r\n    at resolveToken (core.js:12281:24)\r\n    at tryResolveToken (core.js:12226:16)\r\n    at StaticInjector.get (core.js:12121:20)\r\n    at resolveToken (core.js:12281:24)\r\n    at tryResolveToken (core.js:12226:16)\r\n    at StaticInjector.get (core.js:12121:20)\r\n    at resolveNgModuleDep (core.js:24381:29)\r\n    at _createClass (core.js:24430:29)\r\n    at _createProviderInstance (core.js:24400:26) '<angular-feedback-component _nghost-mwx-c0=\"\">'\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1202.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      12.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               12.2.17\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         12.2.17\r\n@angular/cdk                       12.2.13\r\n@angular/elements                  12.2.16\r\n@angular/localize                  12.2.16\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   12.2.13\r\n@angular/upgrade                   12.2.16\r\n@schematics/angular                12.2.17\r\nrxjs                               6.6.7\r\ntypescript                         4.7.3\r\nwebpack                            4.46.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI have followed the Angular doc on how to use ngUpgrade and downgrade a service and use HttPClient, but no luck as can't get past the above error.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46316","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"VM1689 angular.js:15697 NullInjectorError: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]:    StaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[UserFeedbackService -> http_HttpClient]:      NullInjectorError: No provider for http_HttpClient!\" (#46316)"},{"Id":"1265529155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-09T03:01:33","Actor":"khempenius","Number":"46315","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): add cloudflare loader","State":"open","Body":"Pushing up as a placeholder.

At least 90% of the time, this is so that I can describe CSS for mobile vs desktop differently. I can bind the element attribute to individual elements if necessary, but usually, multiple elements in a component need to react to changes in screen size, so I like to bind it at the `:host` level, and drill down to affected elements in CSS.\r\n\r\nIf I want to bind an element attribute to an Observable, I have to follow 3 steps:\r\n\r\n1. Do the async work somewhere.\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class SomeService {\r\n  asyncProduct$ = new BehaviorSubject('foo');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Build access to the Observable in component logic.\r\n```\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-thing'})\r\nexport class SomeComponent {\r\nproductAccess$ = this.svc.asyncProduct$.asObservable();\r\nconstructor(private svc: SomeService) {\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Bind the element attribute(s) to the access built in step 2.\r\n```\r\n<div [attr.product]=\"productAccess$ | async\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr an alternative, used more often:\r\n1. Do the async work somewhere. (Same as above.)\r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class SomeService {\r\n  asyncProduct$ = new BehaviorSubject('foo');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Build access to the Observable in component logic, this time by managing a Subscription.\r\n```\r\n@Component({selector: 'app-thing'})\r\nexport class SomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  subscriptions = new Subscription();\r\n  productAccess: ProductAccess;\r\n  constructor(private svc: SomeService) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.aubscriptions.add(\r\n      this.svc.asyncProduct$.subscribe(prod => this.productAccess = prod)\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n    this.subscriptions.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Bind the attribute to the template using @HostBinding syntax.

If this isn't something on your radar any time soon please let me know and I could create a PR when it comes time for us needing to put more priority on this.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you know of an alternative workaround to pass the config for the short term please let me know!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"support for providing esbuild options\" (#23322)"},{"Id":"1265139536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-08T19:31:22","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"23321","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): correctly print package manager name when an install is needed","State":"closed","Body":"I was testing if we supported a warning here today and noticed that it was printing \"Try installing with '[object Object] install'\".

These were denied repeatedly.\r\nWith non-trivial projects, the given workarounds lead to unmaintainable configuration spaghetti, where it would be pretty simple to separate the individual configuration facets.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to allow developers using angular-cli to manage their projects efficiently and allow Angular maintainers to not have to deal with merging logic, *I suggest adding a mechanism which allows the project developers to conduct the merging process in whatever fashion they fancy*. \r\nTo achieve this, add an optional callback from [src](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/f6f37821c892fbe476e0879877415dbadef5e359/packages/angular_devkit/architect/node/node-modules-architect-host.ts#L182) that allows the project developers to apply whatever magic they deem necessary. This will allow the community to create plugins which will achieve the most common tasks.\r\n\r\nThings needed:\r\n- add configuration property to angular.json schema to reference the external merging function\r\n- add callback invocation (if enabled) to the code where configuration options are decided on (see above)\r\n- callback method should look like\r\n  ```ts\r\n  function angularConfigurationOptionCallback(activeConfigurationNames: string[], optionsLookup: Record<string, AngularCLIOptions>): AngularCLIOptions;\r\n  ```\r\n  where `activeConfigurationNames` is an array of currently enabled configrations, eg `--configuration=a,b,c -> ['a','b','c']`\r\n  where `optionsLookup` is a lookup of all configuration options of angular.json mapped by their name\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- Hacking package.json install callbacks to monkey patch the angular-cli files in question (would need to track all minor updates for breaking changes).\r\n- Using a surrounding build tool (maven, gradle, ..) to do the monkey patching\r\n- Throw away the sophisticated configuration and use another build tool to prepare the workspace by assembling all conditional assets and file replacements beforehand\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23300","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow custom option merging wrt multiple configurations\" (#23300)"},{"Id":"1262585689","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-07T00:45:22","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23299","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: reduce use of npmrc for test npm configuration","State":"open","Body":"This way npmrc can be used for global cross-test configuration and environment variables can be overridden locally for each test case.

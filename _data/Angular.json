This function can return a string, ands acts the same as previous string redirects, or a `UrlTree`, which will act as an absolute redirect.\r\n\r\nTo be useful, the redirect function needs access to the params and data. Today, developers can access these in their redirect strings, for example `{path: ':id', redirectTo: '/user/:id'}`. Unfortunately, developers only have access to params and data on the _current route_ today in the redirect strings. The params and data in the `RedirectFn` give developers access to anything from the matched parent routes as well. This is done as the same way as param and data aggregation later on (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/897f014785578d87bc655ea6ae9e113653960f50/packages/router/src/router_state.ts#L236-L278). In order to accomplish this, we inherit params and data while matching, after the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` is created for the matched route rather than waiting until the end.\r\n\r\nThe `RedirectFunction` does not return the full\r\n`ActivatedRouteSnapshot` interface. Some things are not accurately known at the route matching phase. For example, resolvers are not run until later, so any resolved title would not be populated. The same goes for lazy loaded components. The is also true for all the snapshots up to the root, so properties that include parents (root, parent, pathFromRoot) are also excluded. And naturally, the full route matching hasn't yet happened so firstChild and children are not available either.\r\n\r\nfixes #13373\r\nresolves #28661 (though not for the redirect string - you would return a `UrlTree` from the function)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52606","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): Allow Route.redirectTo to be a function which returns a…\" (#52606)"},{"Id":"1982279191","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-07T21:41:39","Actor":"saharis9988","Number":"52605","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix ssr link in readme","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

@defer","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this feature request is to enhance the functionality of the newly proposed `@defer` syntax by introducing a contextual variable, referred to as `$resourceUrl`. This variable will be automatically populated with the import URL of the code that is marked to be deferred loaded.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for introducing the `$resourceUrl` contextual variable within the `@defer ` syntax is to streamline the management of service worker caches.\r\nThe presence of an auto-generated and easily accessible `$resourceUrl` mitigates the complexity of keeping a unique identifier refering to the unknown lazy loaded file for example in the indexedDB to identify if the service worker cache was already filled with the specific lazy loaded file.\r\n\r\nThis feature is expected to have a positive impact on the current workflow by reducing boilerplate code, minimizing errors related to manual URL handling, and standardizing the approach across the entire codebase.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the component code something like the following would be possible\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n// my-component.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  ...\r\n  template: `\r\n    <!-- the `on` condition is just exemplary -->\r\n    @defer(when isSWCached($resourceUrl); on viewport) {...}\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  private messageChannel = new MessageChannel();\r\n  \r\n  constructor() {\r\n\t  navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({\r\n\t\t    type: 'INIT_PORT',\r\n\t  }, [this.messageChannel.port2]);\r\n  \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  isSWCached(resourceUrl: string) {\r\n\t  return new Promise(resolve = >{\r\n\t\t  this.messageChannel.port1.onmessage = (event) => {\r\n\t\t    if (event.data.payload.id === resourceUrl) {\r\n\t\t\t    resolve(coerceBoolean(event.data.payload.isCached));\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t  };\r\n\t\t  this.navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({\r\n\t\t\t    type: 'CHECK_CACHE',\r\n\t\t\t    payload: {\r\n\t\t\t\t    id: resourceUrl\r\n\t\t\t    }\r\n\t\t  });\r\n\t  };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the related service-worker.js could use the `caches` API directly to respond to the `postMessage`\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// service-worker.js\r\nlet _port;\r\n\r\n// Listen to the CHECK_CACHE message\r\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\r\nif (event.data && event.data.type === 'INIT_PORT') {\r\n    _port = event.ports[0];\r\n}\r\n  \r\nif (event.data && event.data.type === 'CHECK_CACHE') {\r\n\tcaches.open(cacheName).then(async (cache) => {      \r\n\t\tconst cacheResult = await cache.match(event.data.payload.id);\r\n\t\t_port.postMessage({\r\n\t\t\tpayload: {\r\n\t\t\t\tisCached: cacheResult !== undefined\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t})\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe same can propably be achieved with using indexedDB and a custom unique identifier instead of the `$resourceUrl`, but would be much harder to implement in my opinion.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52593","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add \"contextual variables\" to the new @defer\" (#52593)"},{"Id":"1981631502","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-07T17:11:26","Actor":"samdoeswork","Number":"52583","RawContent":null,"Title":"Realistic migration path?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nupgrade\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIs there a realistic way to upgrade from Angular 12?\r\n\r\nIt's totally unworkable for *real world* apps outside of Google. (Realistically I am sure it involved a lot of hand-holding inside Google also).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease don't take this as criticism. It's a **sincere** attempt to inform you of what things are like for a typical app outside Google.\r\n\r\nFirst - with every major release ~30% of all community packages are unsupported. So every single version increment involves removing and replacing multiple packages.\r\n\r\nSecond - following the upgrade guide and running ng upgrade, it still lands on internally incompatible releases. I suspect the path from older versions became broken at some point since it was current. There's several @angular packages which all have peer-dependencies on each other and following the upgrade guide still cannot get them to compile.\r\n\r\nMany migrations fail with errors. When they fail they cannot be retried. There is no \"here's how to do this manually\" link.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 12 hours of trying to do the upgrade, there's hundreds of issues, I've manually replaced 6 dead packages, and webpack appears to completely not understand CSS any longer. It's not realistic to open dozens of individual issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this is the typical experience of an Angular user trying to upgrade. But the reason this never reaches your attention is people don't make this kind of post - they just quiet quit (and stop maintaining their packages).\r\n\r\nIf I upgrade React or Vue, nothing breaks. And it's one package. You can import parts from that package.\r\n\r\nFor the (many) people who simply cannot upgrade, is there some realistic advice (create a new app with x recommended settings, and try and copy things component-by-component, fixing issues as they arise?)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think realistically without the engineering resources & direct support which Google gets - most people are realistically unable to do the upgrades.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's some tooling to help people start with a clean-sheet app and copy & upgrade their components? The current path isn't just too painful it's flatly not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease take this in the spirit it's intended: firstly as a notice of what it's really like for a long-term user, and secondly as a plea for some kind of help. It would be really nice to be on V17 as it looks super nice. At a minimum you should consider surveying what %age of people succeed in their migration path. I suspect I am the common case & the biggest driver of abandonment on the framework is that upgrading is not possible.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nNA\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nHundreds...\r\n\r\nFailing migrations that cannot be retried. Peer dependencies between internal Angular packages which cannot resolve. Imports between Angular packages which are broken at every step.

This is confusing to users if they don't realize they need to remove focus from the chips field in order for the element to become enabled.\r\n* When a required chips component is the last field in a form, followed by a conditionally disabled submit button and a cancel button, a user may accidentally hit the cancel button if they attempt to tab to the submit button.\r\n* With chips that can be dragged and dropped, the chips field does not necessarily receive focus when chips are moved around. This results in chips being visibly moved, but the form control value does not get updated. Since order generally matters for chips that can be dragged and dropped, a user could get the desired order visually, while a different order gets persisted upon submission.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-chips-bug-f6octd?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSince version 15, very long text options in a mat-select element are no longer truncated, but break onto multiple lines.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have no white spaces in the option text, then the option will truncate.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is to have some consistency across all options, whether it be that they all truncate or they wrap onto multiple lines.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting the code it seems that options are using truncation applied to list items, with which they share the \"mdc-list-item__primary-text\" class \r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/26441392/6b36f910-0e95-470e-bcd6-2abd24e91cea)\r\n\r\nHowever, that is been overridden for options in a

to wrap if too long, but not if they don't contain any white space.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis can be reproduced in the Angular Material Documentation by changing the text in any two options in dev tools https://v15.material.angular.io/components/select/examples\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/26441392/b98b9b3c-e0b0-4f1a-ab33-190f4b94a72a)\n\n### Expected

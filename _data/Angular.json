This works fine for changes that\r\noriginate in `NgCompiler` APIs, but a client of the `TemplateTypeChecker`\r\nmay use that API in ways that create new `ts.Program`s without the\r\n`NgCompiler`'s knowledge. This caused the `NgCompiler`'s concept of the\r\n\"next\" program to get out of sync, causing incorrectness in future\r\nincremental analysis.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring cleans up the compiler's `ts.Program` management in\r\nseveral ways:\r\n\r\n* `TypeCheckingProgramStrategy`, the API which controls `ts.Program`\r\n  updating, is renamed to the `ProgramDriver` and extracted to a separate\r\n  ngtsc package.\r\n\r\n* It loses its responsibility of determining component shim filenames. That\r\n  functionality now lives exclusively in the template type-checking package.\r\n\r\n* The \"next\" `ts.Program` concept is renamed to the \"current\" program, as\r\n  the \"next\" name was misleading in several ways.\r\n\r\n* `NgCompiler` now wraps the `ProgramDriver` used in the\r\n  `TemplateTypeChecker` to know when a new `ts.Program` is created,\r\n  regardless of which API drove the creation, which actually fixes the bug.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41291","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): ensure the compiler tracks `ts.Program`s correctly\" (#41291)"},{"Id":"836389778","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-19T21:56:08","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"41290","RawContent":null,"Title":"build+ci(docs-infra): remove unused contributor images and add CI check","State":"open","Body":"This PR removes some unused contributor images and adds a check to ensure no unused images exist.\r\nSee individual commits for details.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41290","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build+ci(docs-infra): remove unused contributor images and add CI check\" (#41290)"},{"Id":"836383653","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-19T21:49:45","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"41289","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): cleanup redundant storage of reuse `ts.Program`","State":"open","Body":"In the compiler, the `NgtscProgram` is mostly a facade for `NgCompiler`\r\nwhich actually drives the compilation.

I would expect the data sorce to be properly initialized when set in the constructor.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e99ca0ac9b0088d20d5d680092cd7ea5624934c0/src/material/tree/data-source/flat-data-source.ts#L144\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTree renders as if data is empty\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 11\r\n- CDK/Material: 11\r\n- Browser(s): latest chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22282","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(tree): tree does not initialize when data is set in constructor\" (#22282)"},{"Id":"834530176","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T08:34:48","Actor":"Vitaljok","Number":"22276","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-selection-list): Model change fired twice for the selection list with [multiple]=\"false\"","State":"open","Body":"#### For the `mat-selection-list` with multiple selections disabled the model change event is fired twice.\r\n\r\nStackBlitz to reproduce: \r\n- https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-gatbrx?devtoolsheight=33&file=src/app/example-component.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

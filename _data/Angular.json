These dependencies are typically defined on parent components (or not).

This is a source of slowness in\r\nBazel sandboxed builds because many unused files will be linked/made\r\navailable for many concurrently-running actions.\r\n\r\nWe should limit the inputs only to what is assumed to be used.

Add a `package.json` to the directory and set `\"sideEffects\": [\"./index.ts\", \"./abstract-control.ts\" and \"./abstract-control.directive.ts\"]` in it\r\n    3. Add a `package.json` to the directory and set `\"sideEffects\": true` in it\r\n* specifying a rule in Webpack's `module.rules` that matches every TS file in the directory and set `sideEffects: true`\r\n\r\nDespite that, they are all excluded from the bundle. Could this be an issue with [Angular's webpack config](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/13.2.x/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/configs/common.ts) or [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack)?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproduction repository: https://github.com/amitbeck/ng-webpack-sideEffects-repro\r\nEither:\r\n1.

Essentially launching each test in a subprocess to a) not mix with the test-runner PATH, npm modules etc, b) prevent environment (vars, cwd, ...) side effects from one test effecting the next tests or the test-runner.\r\n\r\nPrefactor commits (can be merged on their own ahead of time instead of squashing):\r\n* Wait for `killAllProcesses` to actually complete before proceeding. Killing a procedure is async but was not being await-ed. This creates race conditions but once tests are run in a subprocess those are far more likely (the subprocess dies before killing subprocesses completes).\r\n* Refactor the main e2e_runner.ts into separate methods, async/await instead of `.then`.\r\n* Distinguish test setup vs tests better (in preparation for tests being launched in subprocesses, also distinguishes setup vs test better in the stdout).\r\n\r\nMain change:\r\n* A specific version of npm + yarn are installed alongside the angular-cli npm package being tested. This will be required in bazel where nothing outside the sandbox (global node/npm/yarn) is accessible. This also sets specific version numbers which could be dynamic in the future.\r\n* Tests run in a sandboxed subprocess environment using those specific npm + yarn + cli packages.\r\n* Tests no longer have access to the node_modules or environment of the test-runner, only the modules installed within that sandboxed environment. So things like `puppeteer` now need to be installed within the sandboxed test environment (previously it was using the one in the git repo node_modules). The `protractor` used in the tests is now the correct one in the test project node_modules (not the one the cli git repo node_modules), so `webdriver-manager` must now run on that test project and not only the git repo.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n* launch \"setup\" in the main process to setup the test environment (no real changes from before)\r\n* launch each \"initializer\" in subprocesses (some of the previous \"setup\" scripts are now \"initializers\" which run in the subprocess, but no big changes)\r\n* launch each test in the subprocesses","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23245","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"run e2e tests in isolated child processes\"

[`v0.14.42`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01442)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.41...v0.14.42)\n\n-   Fix a parser hang on invalid CSS ([#&#8203;2276](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2276))\n\n    Previously invalid CSS with unbalanced parentheses could cause esbuild's CSS parser to hang. An example of such an input is the CSS file `:x(`. This hang has been fixed.\n\n-   Add support for custom log message levels\n\n    This release allows you to override the default log level of esbuild's individual log messages. For example, CSS syntax errors are treated as warnings instead of errors by default because CSS grammar allows for rules containing syntax errors to be ignored. However, if you would like for esbuild to consider CSS syntax errors to be build errors, you can now configure that like this:\n\n    -   CLI\n\n        ```sh\n        $ esbuild example.css --log-override:css-syntax-error=error\n        ```\n\n    -   JS API\n\n        ```js\n        let result = await esbuild.build({\n          entryPoints: ['example.css'],\n          logOverride: {\n            'css-syntax-error': 'error',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go API\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          EntryPoints: []string{\"example.ts\"},\n          LogOverride: map[string]api.LogLevel{\n            \"css-syntax-error\": api.LogLevelError,\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    You can also now use this feature to silence warnings that you are not interested in. Log messages are referred to by their identifier. Each identifier is stable (i.e. shouldn't change over time) except there is no guarantee that the log message will continue to exist. A given log message may potentially be removed in the future, in which case esbuild will ignore log levels set for that identifier. The current list of supported log level identifiers for use with this feature can be found below:\n\n    **JavaScript:**\n\n    -   `assign-to-constant`\n    -   `call-import-namespace`\n    -   `commonjs-variable-in-esm`\n    -   `delete-super-property`\n    -   `direct-eval`\n    -   `duplicate-case`\n    -   `duplicate-object-key`\n    -   `empty-import-meta`\n    -   `equals-nan`\n    -   `equals-negative-zero`\n    -   `equals-new-object`\n    -   `html-comment-in-js`\n    -   `impossible-typeof`\n    -   `private-name-will-throw`\n    -   `semicolon-after-return`\n    -   `suspicious-boolean-not`\n    -   `this-is-undefined-in-esm`\n    -   `unsupported-dynamic-import`\n    -   `unsupported-jsx-comment`\n    -   `unsupported-regexp`\n    -   `unsupported-require-call`\n\n    **CSS:**\n\n    -   `css-syntax-error`\n    -   `invalid-@&#8203;charset`\n    -   `invalid-@&#8203;import`\n    -   `invalid-@&#8203;nest`\n    -   `invalid-@&#8203;layer`\n    -   `invalid-calc`\n    -   `js-comment-in-css`\n    -   `unsupported-@&#8203;charset`\n    -   `unsupported-@&#8203;namespace`\n    -   `unsupported-css-property`\n\n    **Bundler:**\n\n    -   `different-path-case`\n    -   `ignored-bare-import`\n    -   `ignored-dynamic-import`\n    -   `import-is-undefined`\n    -   `package.json`\n    -   `require-resolve-not-external`\n    -   `tsconfig.json`\n\n    **Source maps:**\n\n    -   `invalid-source-mappings`\n    -   `sections-in-source-map`\n    -   `missing-source-map`\n    -   `unsupported-source-map-comment`\n\n    Documentation about which identifiers correspond to which log messages will be added in the future, but hasn't been written yet. Note that it's not possible to configure the log level for a build error. This is by design because changing that would cause esbuild to incorrectly proceed in the building process generate invalid build output. You can only configure the log level for non-error log messages (although you can turn non-errors into errors).\n\n### [`v0.14.41`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01441)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.40...v0.14.41)\n\n-   Fix a minification regression in 0.14.40 ([#&#8203;2270](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2270), [#&#8203;2271](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2271), [#&#8203;2273](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2273))\n\n    Version 0.14.40 substituted string property keys with numeric property keys if the number has the same string representation as the original string. This was done in three places: computed member expressions, object literal properties, and class fields. However, negative numbers are only valid in computed member expressions while esbuild incorrectly applied this substitution for negative numbers in all places. This release fixes the regression by only doing this substitution for negative numbers in computed member expressions.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;susiwen8](https://togithub.com/susiwen8).\n\n### [`v0.14.40`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01440)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.39...v0.14.40)\n\n-   Correct esbuild's implementation of `\"preserveValueImports\": true` ([#&#8203;2268](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2268))\n\n    TypeScript's [`preserveValueImports` setting](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserveValueImports) tells the compiler to preserve unused imports, which can sometimes be necessary because otherwise TypeScript will remove unused imports as it assumes they are type annotations. This setting is useful for programming environments that strip TypeScript types as part of a larger code transformation where additional code is appended later that will then make use of those unused imports, such as with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).\n\n    This release fixes an issue where esbuild's implementation of `preserveValueImports` diverged from the official TypeScript compiler. If the import clause is present but empty of values (even if it contains types), then the import clause should be considered a type-only import clause. This was an oversight, and has now been fixed:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    import \"keep\"\n    import { k1 } from \"keep\"\n    import k2, { type t1 } from \"keep\"\n    import {} from \"remove\"\n    import { type t2 } from \"remove\"\n\n    // Old output under \"preserveValueImports\": true\n    import \"keep\";\n    import { k1 } from \"keep\";\n    import k2, {} from \"keep\";\n    import {} from \"remove\";\n    import {} from \"remove\";\n\n    // New output under \"preserveValueImports\": true (matches the TypeScript compiler)\n    import \"keep\";\n    import { k1 } from \"keep\";\n    import k2 from \"keep\";\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid regular expression syntax errors in older browsers ([#&#8203;2215](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2215))\n\n    Previously esbuild always passed JavaScript regular expression literals through unmodified from the input to the output. This is undesirable when the regular expression uses newer features that the configured target environment doesn't support. For example, the `d` flag (i.e. the [match indices feature](https://v8.dev/features/regexp-match-indices)) is new in ES2022 and doesn't work in older browsers. If esbuild generated a regular expression literal containing the `d` flag, then older browsers would consider esbuild's output to be a syntax error and none of the code would run.\n\n    With this release, esbuild now detects when an unsupported feature is being used and converts the regular expression literal into a `new RegExp()` constructor instead. One consequence of this is that the syntax error is transformed into a run-time error, which allows the output code to run (and to potentially handle the run-time error). Another consequence of this is that it allows you to include a polyfill that overwrites the `RegExp` constructor in older browsers with one that supports modern features. Note that esbuild does not handle polyfills for you, so you will need to include a `RegExp` polyfill yourself if you want one.\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(/b/d.exec('abc').indices)\n\n    // New output (with --target=chrome90)\n    console.log(/b/d.exec(\"abc\").indices);\n\n    // New output (with --target=chrome89)\n    console.log(new RegExp(\"b\", \"d\").exec(\"abc\").indices);\n    ```\n\n    This is currently done transparently without a warning. If you would like to debug this transformation to see where in your code esbuild is transforming regular expression literals and why, you can pass `--log-level=debug` to esbuild and review the information present in esbuild's debug logs.\n\n-   Add Opera to more internal feature compatibility tables ([#&#8203;2247](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2247), [#&#8203;2252](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2252))\n\n    The internal compatibility tables that esbuild uses to determine which environments support which features are derived from multiple sources. Most of it is automatically derived from [these ECMAScript compatibility tables](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/), but missing information is manually copied from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/), GitHub PR comments, and various other websites. Version 0.14.35 of esbuild introduced Opera as a possible target environment which was automatically picked up by the compatibility table script, but the manually-copied information wasn't updated to include Opera. This release fixes this omission so Opera feature compatibility should now be accurate.\n\n    This was contributed by [@&#8203;lbwa](https://togithub.com/lbwa).\n\n-   Ignore `EPERM` errors on directories ([#&#8203;2261](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2261))\n\n    Previously bundling with esbuild when inside a sandbox environment which does not have permission to access the parent directory did not work because esbuild would try to read the directory to search for a `node_modules` folder and would then fail the build when that failed. In practice this caused issues with running esbuild with `sandbox-exec` on macOS. With this release, esbuild will treat directories with permission failures as empty to allow for the `node_modules` search to continue past the denied directory and into its parent directory. This means it should now be possible to bundle with esbuild in these situations. This fix is similar to the fix in version 0.9.1 but is for `EPERM` while that fix was for `EACCES`.\n\n-   Remove an irrelevant extra `\"use strict\"` directive ([#&#8203;2264](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2264))\n\n    The presence of a `\"use strict\"` directive in the output file is controlled by the presence of one in the entry point. However, there was a bug that would include one twice if the output format is ESM. This bug has been fixed.\n\n-   Minify strings into integers inside computed properties ([#&#8203;2214](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2214))\n\n    This release now minifies `a[\"0\"]` into `a[0]` when the result is equivalent:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(x['0'], { '0': x }, class { '0' = x })\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(x[\"0\"],{\"0\":x},class{\"0\"=x});\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(x[0],{0:x},class{0=x});\n    ```\n\n    This transformation currently only happens when the numeric property represents an integer within the signed 32-bit integer range.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>csstools/postcss-plugins</summary>\n\n### [`v7.7.0`](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/blob/HEAD/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;770-May-31-2022)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/compare/cc0a6c93e0deb0c279e3b32e15c96f41efbd412c...9c40eac2c77c904412cea7fea0e711faa7cbe4e7)\n\n-   Added `@csstools/postcss-trigonometric-functions` <br/> [Check the plugin README](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-trigonometric-functions#readme) for usage details.\n-   Updated `@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers` to `1.0.2` (patch)\n-   Updated `postcss-color-functional-notation` to `4.2.3` (patch)\n-   Updated `postcss-nesting` to `10.1.7` (patch)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v14.1.2`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1412-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1411v1412-2022-05-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v14.1.1...v14.1.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   do not use loaderId for lifecycle events ([#&#8203;8395](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8395)) ([c96c915](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/c96c915b535dcf414038677bd3d3ed6b980a4901))\n-   fix release-please bot ([#&#8203;8400](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8400)) ([5c235c7](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5c235c701fc55380f09d09ac2cf63f2c94b60e3d))\n-   use strict TS in Input.ts ([#&#8203;8392](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8392)) ([af92a24](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/af92a24ba9fc8efea1ba41f96d87515cf760da65))\n\n##### [14.1.1](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v14.1.0...v14.1.1) (2022-05-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   kill browser process when 'taskkill' fails on Windows ([#&#8203;8352](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8352)) ([dccfadb](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/dccfadb90e8947cae3f33d7a209b6f5752f97b46))\n-   only check loading iframe in lifecycling ([#&#8203;8348](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8348)) ([7438030](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/74380303ac6cc6e2d84948a10920d56e665ccebe))\n-   recompile before funit and unit commands ([#&#8203;8363](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8363)) ([8735b78](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/8735b784ba7838c1002b521a7f9f23bb27263d03)), closes [#&#8203;8362](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8362)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>stylus/stylus</summary>\n\n### [`v0.58.1`](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#&#8203;0581--2022-05-31)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/compare/0.58.0...0.58.1)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   fix: bin/stylus in npm packages contains windows style line endings [#&#8203;2691](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/issues/2691)\n-   ci: add yarn bin/stylus execute regression test [#&#8203;2692](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/pull/2692)\n\n### [`v0.58.0`](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#&#8203;0580--2022-05-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/compare/0.57.0...0.58.0)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   feat: support full css level 4 logical combination selectors (`:is`, `:where`, `:not`, `:has`).

If you don't provide a PAT token, Scorecards will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` available in the workflow. Due to limitations of the permissions model and GitHub APIs, be aware of the following limitations:\n\n1.  Without a PAT, the Branch-Protection is not supported, so it will be disabled. You will not receive alerts for this check.\n2.  Scorecards only supports PAT on private repositories. If you want to install Scorecards on a private repository, you still need to use a PAT.\n\nFor more information, visit the [README.md](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/v1.1.0#readme)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;rohankh532](https://togithub.com/rohankh532) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112)\n-   [@&#8203;justaugustus](https://togithub.com/justaugustus) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126)\n-   [@&#8203;jamietanna](https://togithub.com/jamietanna) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145)\n-   [@&#8203;jonasbb](https://togithub.com/jonasbb) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129)\n-   [@&#8203;azeemshaikh38](https://togithub.com/azeemshaikh38) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After scrolling the table horizontally and clicking on sort header, some cells of sticky columns are rendered with offsets. After moving a cursor or tapping (on touch devices) the view is refreshed and looks as expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue appears only when not all of data present in MatTableSource.data is displayed. When page size of paginator is set that is show all the data, everything works fine.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce in example project:\r\n1. Move horizontal scroll\r\n2. Click on any sort header 2 times - try not to move cursor much\r\n3. Sticky columns cells should display with offset or not display at all\r\n4. After moving cursor, view is back to normal\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSticky columns shouldn't change position after sorting data\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSticky columns change position\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome (v101.0.4951.64), Firefox(v100.0.2), Safari (v15.1)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24977","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTable MatSort MatPaginator): Wrong display of sticky columns after sorting\" (#24977)"},{"Id":"1248938621","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-26T01:22:53","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"24976","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v14.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"14.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24976","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v14.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#24976)"},{"Id":"1248872399","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-25T23:23:52","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"24975","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24975","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#24975)"},{"Id":"1248853780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-25T23:11:40","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"24974","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v13.3.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"13.3.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24974","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v13.3.8 release\" (#24974)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-06-01T03:30:03.2289697Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2269}

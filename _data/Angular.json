The thing that I don't understand is the section [Function calls are not supported](https://angular.io/guide/aot-metadata-errors#function-calls-not-supported).\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm reasonably sure that the title is misleading and/or outdated since function **calls** do very much seem to be allowed in metadata / decorators, since they are commonly used in Angular code and documentation. For example, the documentation of [RouterModule](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterModule) contains the common example of\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(ROUTES)]\r\n})\r\nclass MyNgModule {}\r\n```\r\nwhich according to my understanding constitutes a function call (`RouterModule.forChild(...)`) and is part of a decorator and therefore metadata.\r\n\r\nThen, the first actual statement in that documentation section is \"The compiler does not currently support [function expressions or lambda functions](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#function-expression)\" which again, gives me reason to pause since that is something completely different than function **calls**.\r\n\r\nBut even if that's just a confusion that is specific to me, then there is still the fact that everything that this section describes as generating errors, seems to work just fine _with Ivy_. I've been using older, pre-Ivy versions of Angular for a long time and am generally familiar with the described issues, but as far as I can tell, none of that applies to modern Angular applications anymore.\r\n\r\nIs there a bug in my _interpretation_ of the documentation? What is the _context_ that would make my examples fail?\r\n\r\nI've been (mostly) sticking to the \"approved\" patterns in my code, but since it causes significant overhead and is counter intuitive to newcomers, I would like to know how it actually works (or doesn't work).\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/aot-metadata-errors#function-calls-not-supported\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\nSimply create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI and update the content of app.component.ts to\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Inject, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nexport const TitleToken = new InjectionToken(\"TitleToken\");\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: TitleToken,\r\n      useFactory: () => {\r\n        return `Injected ArrowFactory Title @ ${new Date()}`\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  public constructor(\r\n    @Inject(TitleToken) public readonly title: string\r\n  ) {}\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\nThe sample above builds and runs just fine in both development an production mode and the documentation says that it should not.\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Upon upgrading to Angular 13, we found out that deployUrl had been deprecated in favor of baseHref and / or APP_BASE_HREF. So part of our migration consisted in removing deployUrl in our Web Components SPA that is used by our affiliates to embed our Web Components into their web sites. We already had baseHref (in project.json) and APP_BASE_HREF (in AppModule) \r\n\r\nproject.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"configurations\": {\r\n  \"production\": {\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"https://elements.iko.travel/\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nproviders: [\r\n   {\r\n      provide: APP_BASE_HREF,\r\n      useValue: environment.baseHref,\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nenvironment.prod.ts \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  baseHref: 'https://elements.iko.travel/',\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ndefined alongside deployUrl so migration involved only removing deployUrl from ./apps/web-components/project.json (We use Nx).\r\n\r\nImmediately after a release to production, we were notified that our Web Components were no longer loading properly. We looked at one of the sites and could see it was trying to load our modules locally to the affiliate site.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nA page is hosted here: https://life.rocks/and/then/some. It contains one of our Web Components. Our WC would try to load assets from that same URL like so: \r\n`https://life.rocks/and/then/some/897.js`\r\n\r\nOnce we reverted back to deployUrl, everything worked as it should again. baseHref and APP_BASE_HREF had no effect on where libraries were loaded from.\r\n\r\nPlease make very sure before removing deployUrl that it does not cause this type of error to occur.\r\n\r\nWe could easily spin up this error in staging upon request but it would maybe be worth a quick look in your codebase to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnx report\r\n\r\n >  NX   Report complete - copy this into the issue template\r\n\r\n   Node : 16.14.2\r\n   OS   : darwin arm64\r\n   yarn : 1.22.18\r\n\r\n   Angular / CLI: 13.3.3\r\n   nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/angular : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/cypress : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/detox : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/devkit : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/express : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/jest : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/js : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/linter : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/nest : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/next : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/node : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-cloud : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-plugin : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react-native : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/schematics : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/storybook : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/web : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/workspace : 13.10.3\r\n   typescript : 4.6.3\r\n   rxjs : 7.5.5\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Community plugins:\r\n   \t @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome: 0.10.2\r\n   \t @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap: 12.0.2\r\n   \t @ngneat/transloco: 4.0.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/data: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/effects: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/entity: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/router-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store-devtools: 13.1.0\r\n   \t angular-calendar: 0.29.0\r\n   \t @compodoc/compodoc: 1.1.19\r\n   \t @jscutlery/semver: 2.22.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/schematics: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @storybook/angular: 6.4.22\r\n```\r\n\r\n🍺\r\nBjorn\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23033","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Do not deprecate deployUrl.

We come from three projects that rely on parse5 — namely [Cheerio](https://togithub.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), [rehype](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).\n\n**We need your support to continue the project!** If you care about parse5, please support us financially on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/parse5).\n\nHeadlining features of this release are ES Modules, TypeScript, and performance improvements: 7.0.0 is 45% faster than 6.0.1 with default options, and 167% faster with location information enabled (for the `bench/perf` benchmark, on an M1 Mac). Version 7.0.0 is a revamp of every part of the library. There are too many changes to list them all here, so here is a high-level overview:\n\n#### Breaking: ESM\n\nAll of parse5’s packages are now ECMAScript Modules. We are providing dual packages for `parse5` and `parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter` for now (see [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418) and [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496)).\n\nTo migrate, please read [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) on how to update. Note that private internals are no longer available; instead, everything that you need should be imported from the main package.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j) in [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/351)*\n\n#### Breaking: TypeScript\n\nThe codebase has been ported to TypeScript. This helped uncover a number of subtle logic bugs, such as [`dc4e269`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/dc4e269022ebbae0767d8f790a29d6be1835fe1e), [`b4b5d4a`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/b4b5d4ad6f90b3c9fd03a90e2ed5267929979a11), or [`a0aff95`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/a0aff9578bb44511bc169c1d7f9e2f2780f7f8a0). TypeScript also helps us refactor with confidence and a lot of the changes in this release would have been much harder to do without it.\n\nTo migrate, please remove `@types/parse5*` as we now ship our own types.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;fb55](https://togithub.com/fb55) in [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362)*\n\n#### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   parse5 was caught up with the HTML spec, and parsing results might differ in edge-cases ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451))\n-   The `parse5-serializer-stream` package was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481)\n    -   To migrate, use the `serialize` function exported by `parse5`.\n-   The rewriting stream now splits very long text sections ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434)) and doesn’t escape text in special tags anymore ([#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/434)). If you worked around these issues before, you might have to update your code.\n-   The htmlparser2 adapter now uses `domhandler`’s node interface ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327) by [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound))\n    -   The format of the tree nodes has changed slightly; eg. some previous properties are now getters and setters, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are using deep imports for any parts of the codebase, you will likely encounter some breakages:\n\n<details><summary>Show internal changes</summary>\n\n-   The tokenizer now uses the state machine pattern from htmlparser2 [`5d7a780` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/5d7a780b70d3669def4c6bb20cbec816804d44a5)\n-   The token queue was replaced with callbacks ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419))\n-   The `OpenElementStack` now uses callbacks [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429)\n-   Mixins were removed (as part of [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362))\n    -   Location tracking now has a substantially lower overhead [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402)\n-   `getNextToken` was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461)\n-   The parser’s `_bootstrap` method was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384)\n-   We now drop chunks from the tokenizer right after they are emitted [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432)\n-   The serializer is no longer a class; instead, different serializer functions call on each other [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383)\n-   parse5 now uses the `entities` module for encoding and decoding entities, sharing maintenance & optimisation work with projects such as htmlparser2 ([`2b92054` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/2b9205458b9305de1406966568567ccfc1633fa1), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486))\n    -   `entities` adopted a variant of parse5’s approach of decoding entities. As a result, decoding performance is equivalent, while memory consumption is slightly lower.\n\n</details>\n#### Other changes\n\n-   **minor** add hooks for stack events to tree adapter interface [#&#8203;385](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/385)\n-   **minor** add support for fragments in `parse5-parser-stream` [#&#8203;487](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/487)\n-   **minor** add `serializeOuter` (like `.outerHTML`), `scriptingEnabled` option [#&#8203;383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/383)\n-   **patch** fix parsing of `<<` in comments parsed wrongly as `<!` ([#&#8203;326](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/326))\n-   **patch** fix position of `endTag` for mixed-case foreign elements ([#&#8203;353](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/353))\n-   **patch** fix end position of `html`, `body` ([#&#8203;436](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/436))\n-   docs: parse5 has a new documentation website at [`parse5.js.org`](http://parse5.js.org/) [#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/443)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\nThanks [@&#8203;anko](https://togithub.com/anko), [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound), [@&#8203;samouri](https://togithub.com/samouri), [@&#8203;alan-agius4](https://togithub.com/alan-agius4), and [@&#8203;pmdartus](https://togithub.com/pmdartus)!\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/compare/v6.0.1...v7.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v0.14.38`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01438)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.37...v0.14.38)\n\n-   Further fixes to TypeScript 4.7 instantiation expression parsing ([#&#8203;2201](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2201))\n\n    This release fixes some additional edge cases with parsing instantiation expressions from the upcoming version 4.7 of TypeScript. Previously it was allowed for an instantiation expression to precede a binary operator but with this release, that's no longer allowed. This was sometimes valid in the TypeScript 4.7 beta but is no longer allowed in the latest version of TypeScript 4.7. Fixing this also fixed a regression that was introduced by the previous release of esbuild:\n\n    | Code           | TS 4.6.3     | TS 4.7.0 beta | TS 4.7.0 nightly | esbuild 0.14.36 | esbuild 0.14.37 | esbuild 0.14.38 |\n    |----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n    | `a<b> == c<d>` | Invalid      | `a == c`      | Invalid          | `a == c`        | `a == c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b> in c<d>` | Invalid      | Invalid       | Invalid          | Invalid         | `a in c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b>>=c<d>`   | Invalid      | Invalid       | Invalid          | Invalid         | `a >= c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b>=c<d>`    | Invalid      | `a < b >= c`  | `a = c`          | `a < b >= c`    | `a = c`         | `a = c`         |\n    | `a<b>>c<d>`    | `a < b >> c` | `a < b >> c`  | `a < b >> c`     | `a < b >> c`    | `a > c`         | `a < b >> c`    |\n\n    This table illustrates some of the more significant changes between all of these parsers. The most important part is that esbuild 0.14.38 now matches the behavior of the latest TypeScript compiler for all of these cases.\n\n### [`v0.14.37`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01437)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.36...v0.14.37)\n\n-   Add support for TypeScript's `moduleSuffixes` field from TypeScript 4.7\n\n    The upcoming version of TypeScript adds the `moduleSuffixes` field to `tsconfig.json` that introduces more rules to import path resolution. Setting `moduleSuffixes` to `[\".ios\", \".native\", \"\"]` will try to look at the the relative files `./foo.ios.ts`, `./foo.native.ts`, and finally `./foo.ts` for an import path of `./foo`. Note that the empty string `\"\"` in `moduleSuffixes` is necessary for TypeScript to also look-up `./foo.ts`. This was announced in the [TypeScript 4.7 beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#resolution-customization-with-modulesuffixes).\n\n-   Match the new ASI behavior from TypeScript nightly builds ([#&#8203;2188](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2188))\n\n    This release updates esbuild to match some very recent behavior changes in the TypeScript parser regarding automatic semicolon insertion. For more information, see TypeScript issues [#&#8203;48711](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/48711) and [#&#8203;48654](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/48654) (I'm not linking to them directly to avoid Dependabot linkback spam on these issues due to esbuild's popularity). The result is that the following TypeScript code is now considered valid TypeScript syntax:\n\n    ```ts\n    class A<T> {}\n    new A<number> /* ASI now happens here */\n    if (0) {}\n\n    interface B {\n      (a: number): typeof a /* ASI now happens here */\n      <T>(): void\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;g-plane](https://togithub.com/g-plane).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.14.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/v8.14.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.13.0...v8.14.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`ab6363d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ab6363dffb9dfd9c6a9abb5292fc712745fe7a64) feat: Add rule no-constant-binary-expression ([#&#8203;15296](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15296)) (Jordan Eldredge)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`35fa1dd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/35fa1dd8932ef3e55c37ec0e4b73b5d88f187e69) fix: allow project paths to have URL-encoded characters ([#&#8203;15795](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15795)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`413f1d5`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/413f1d55f0ad05b6fe75bdde6df423253806797d) fix: update `astUtils.isDirectiveComment` with `globals` and `exported` ([#&#8203;15775](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15775)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Build Related\n\n-   [`c2407e8`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/c2407e81caf2d50325d9aa09bae70d38615ddf2c) build: add node v18 ([#&#8203;15791](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15791)) (唯然)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`735458c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/735458cc96d4ecdb4ed97448b63ed4a579890b13) chore: add static frontmatter to no-constant-binary-expression docs ([#&#8203;15798](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15798)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`db28f2c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/db28f2c9ea6b654f615daf2f7e6f1a2034b85062) chore: Add static frontmatter to docs ([#&#8203;15782](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15782)) (Nicholas C.

For example, the two events on `CdkDropList` that tell you the current container to which a dragged item will snap to are `cdkDropListEntered` and `cdkDropListExited`. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of the snapping functionality built into the module from the start, the `cdkDropListExited` event only fires when the item changes its linked container, not when the container HTMLElement is no longer hovered over (what we would expect from `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` from the native browser API).\r\n\r\nWhile this makes the implementation and management of snapping containers much easier, it only complicates the implementation of non-snapping logic. Mostly because there is no *easy* way to know when a `cdkDropList` is no longer hovered.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to either (or both)\r\n\r\n**a)** Introduce two new events in `cdkDropList` that would mirror the native `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` events and would be triggered when a dragged item enter/leave the area occupied by the container's HTML element (the event mimicking `dragEnter` would not constitute a duplicate of the already existing `cdkDropListEntered` one because it is possible to drag the mouse cursor in and out of the container area multiple times while keeping the dragged item bound to it if no other container was hovered over during the operation).\r\n\r\n**b)** Introduce a new type named `cdkHoverTarget` for example, which would act as a non-snapping hover target (and possibly not a container). It would expose the two events reflecting `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` and would be used to know when the user has its mouse cursor over a specific element during a drag operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nOne use of such a feature that I can think of would be in implementing a file manager: when dragging a file over a folder to move it into that folder, one would not expect the file preview to keep saying \"move to <folder>\" when the folder is no longer hovered over. This use case requires the developer to be able to know when a possible drop target is no longer hovered over, which is not trivial to achieve using the currently exposed events of the drag-drop module.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24814","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(drag-drop): Make it easier to know when a CdkDropList is [no longer] hovered\" (#24814)"},{"Id":"1210648738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-21T07:59:43","Actor":"diprokon","Number":"24813","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input","State":"open","Body":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\r\n\r\nShows valid formatted value for 'falsy' values (exp 0)\r\nCustom DateAdapter (exp TimestampDateAdapter) can have valid numeric 0 value (for timestamp it is 1/1/1970), but datepicker input doesn't show formatted value","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24813","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\" (#24813)"},{"Id":"1210258017","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T21:58:32","Actor":"zarend","Number":"24810","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(select): cannot close non-native select menu with Talkback and iOS voiceover without selecting an option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFor the non-native select, there is no way to close the options menu on mobile screen readers without selection an option.

continue publishing an npm library that works across multiple major Angular versions?\n  - prevent the build from depending on new internal Angular files introduced in Angular 21?\n  - force the compiler to rely only on public, stable Angular APIs, without referencing internal types that do not exist in earlier versions?\n\n\nIf such multi-version support is no longer possible, is there any recommended alternative (e.g., ng-packagr config, TS config, or Angular compatibility mode)?\n\n\n\n# 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you in advance for your help — many teams maintaining long-lifecycle Angular environments likely face similar cross-version library challenges.\n\n\nFabien\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.0\nAngular           : 21.0.0\nNode.js           : 22.19.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 10.9.3\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n┌───────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package       │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/cli  │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/core │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n└───────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65445","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression / Breaking Change with Angular 21: build fails due to @angular/core/primitives/di import\" (#65445)"},{"Id":"3648937653","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T20:22:12","Actor":"zxcdet","Number":"65444","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: input flickers on initial load when using [ngModel]=\"true\" (Angular 21) (zoneless)","State":"open","Body":"`###` Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms, zone.js\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn an Angular 21 project running in **zoneless** mode, <mat-checkbox> components bound with ngModel flicker on initialization.

Instead, the browser displays its standard validation popups (\"This field is required\", etc.). If, as it is traditionally done, the template explicitly shows custom validation error messages for all the validation errors, guarded by an `@if (form.field().touched())`, then those errors don't appear when the form is submitted. We thus end up with only standard browser validation error messages being displayed, and none of the custom error messages being displayed for untouched fields. \n\nThis is surprising when migrating from classic forms. The fix is simple: add a `novalidate` attribute on the form. But having to do that is not obvious, and should at least be documented.\n\nThe problem is visible on [this example from the documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/signals/validation#example-1). If you click the Submit button without touching any control, nothing happens (not even the default browser errors are displayed, but I don't know why).\n\n## Submission calling `markAllAsTouched()`, no `submitted()` signal in field state\n\nThe directives of classic forms have a `submitted` flag. With clssic forms, it's thus possible to have many combinations to choose when error messages should be displayed:\n- when submitted\n- when touched\n- when dirty\n- when touched or submitted\n- when dirty or submitted\n- etc.\n\nSignal forms don't have that `submitted` flag (even though they have a `submitting` flag).\nTo compensate, the `submit()` function (if it is called, which is not necessary) marks all fields as touched.\nThis not only reduces the number of choices we have to display error messages (and sort of imposes the `touched` choice), but it also makes the `touched` flag ambiguous: there's no way to know if a field has really been touched, or if it hasn't but is marked as touched because the form has been submitted.\n\nI would argue that calling `markAllAsTouched` should be left to the developers if they want to, and that a `submitted` signal should be added to `FieldState`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-mwvxwkru?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNA\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.0\nAngular           : 21.0.0\nNode.js           : 20.19.1\nPackage Manager   : npm 10.8.2\nOperating System  : linux x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                   │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/build            │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/cli              │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/common           │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler         │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli     │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/core             │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/forms            │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/router           │ 21.0.0            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ rxjs                      │ 7.8.2             │ ^7.8.1            │\n│ typescript                │ 5.9.3             │ ^5.9.3            │\n│ zone.js                   │ 0.15.0            │ ~0.15.0           │\n└───────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65429","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"weirdnesses regarding validation of signal forms\" (#65429)"},{"Id":"3647856180","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T15:59:29","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"65425","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): fix typo in signal form documentation","State":"closed","Body":"Fix typo in signal form documentation.

Previously, if a `done` callback was used in an unhandled way (e.g., passed as an argument to a helper function), the schematic would remove the `done` parameter but leave the usage, causing runtime errors.\r\n* Improves the transformation of `jasmine.arrayWithExactContents` in the `jasmine-vitest` schematic. While Vitest does not have a direct equivalent for multiset equality, the schematic previously transformed this into a check for length and subset containment, which could lead to false positives (e.g., `[1, 1]` matches `[1, 2]`). Now, the schematic attaches a TODO comment to the generated code, explicitly warning the user that the transformation relies on `expect.arrayContaining` (a subset check) and advising them to verify strict content matching manually.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31878","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Several improvements for Jasmine to Vitest refactor schematic\" (#31878)"},{"Id":"3644153263","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T13:57:17","Actor":"anisabboud","Number":"31877","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prerendering via \"routesFile\" with i18n no longer prerenders index.html, produces infinite \"Redirecting\" loop (since @angular/ssr 20.3.7)","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.6\n\n### Description\n\nUsing `angular.json` `\"prerender\": { \"routesFile\": \"...\", \"discoverRoutes\": false }`, in combination with `\"i18n\": { ... }` and `\"localize\"`, no longer prerenders locale/index.html properly.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nFollow the following minimal reproduction steps:\n1. `ng new test-prerender-i18n --style=scss --ssr --zoneless --ai-config=none`\n2. `cd test-prerender-i18n`\n3. `ng add @angular/localize`\n4. `echo \"/\" > prerender-routes.txt`\n5.

covered in existing issues, docs, or common Q&A\n\nThis creates unnecessary triage overhead.\n\n\n## 📌 Scope\nThis is a workflow and tooling improvement that can build on the existing Angular MCP AI capabilities in the CLI.\n\n\n## 📓 Note\nInspired by NG Poland talk; Issue created with the help of chatGPT\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n## ✨ Proposed Solution\nMake it easier to create a relevant GitHub issue for the team or provide helpful alternatives for users to solve their problem.\n\nThis can be achieved through:\n- 🤖 AI-assisted Issue Intake (GitHub)\n- 🛠 `ng report-issue`\n\n### 1) 🤖 AI-assisted Issue Intake (GitHub)\nBefore submitting an issue, an AI agent should:\n- Validate missing fields and required metadata  \n- Encourage minimal reproducible examples (StackBlitz / small repo) or automatically generate them  \n- Check for duplicates  \n- Suggest relevant docs or known issues when it’s a knowledge gap  \n👉 Could run on GitHub, angular.dev, or another suitable location\n\n### 2) 🛠 `ng report-issue` (CLI workflow)\nA new CLI/MCP command that:\n- Auto-collects context (`ng version`, environment, config excerpts)\n- Helps produce a minimal reproduction  \n- Searches existing issues/docs before creating a new one  \n- Generates a prefilled, high-quality issue using the correct template\n\n## 💡 Benefits\n- Reduced triage workload for Angular maintainers  \n- Higher-quality issues  \n- Fewer duplicates  \n- Easier & faster resolution for users  \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nnone alternatives on my

which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen testing click behaviors using Angular's `TestHarness` (e.g., `MatButtonHarness.click()`) in a Vitest environment with jsdom, the test fails with the following error:\n\n```\nTypeError: Failed to construct 'PointerEvent': member view is not of type Window.\n```\n\nThis issue is caused by the presence of the `view: window` property in the `MouseEvent` options, which is not supported in jsdom. This is a known limitation in Vitest (see [vitest-dev/vitest#4685](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/4685)).\n\nA temporary solution is to configure Vitest to use the `vmThreads` pool in the `defineConfig`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {\n    pool: 'vmThreads',\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHowever, this workaround is not ideal, as it is unclear, non-obvious, and may not be recommended for all use cases.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. `ng new whatever` using @angular/cli@21\n2. `ng add @angular/material`\n3. Import `MatButton` in `App` component\n4. Add the following method\n   ```ts\n   protected sayHello(): void {\n     alert('Hello World!');\n   }   \n   ```\n5. Add matButton element in template\n   ```html\n    <button matButton=\"filled\" (click)=\"sayHello()\">Click Me!</button>\n    ```\n6. Add test case\n    ```ts\n    it('should open alert with hello world when click me button is clicked', async () => {\n      const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n      const loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\n\n      vi.stubGlobal('alert', vi.fn());\n\n      const button = await loader.getHarness(\n        MatButtonHarness.with({\n          text: 'Click Me!',\n        })\n      );\n\n      await button.click();\n\n      expect(alert).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello World!');\n    });\n    ```\n7.

In issue #13544 (Oct 2018), a user reported that the radio ripple doesn’t fade when clicking: \"the ripple doesn't fade away until it loses focus.\" The team responded that \"it is intentional ***but only supposed to be for keyboard and programmatic focus.***\"\n  - In #14349 (Dec 2018), the animation \"outer circle remains at the end [...] disappears only if I click somewhere\" — also closed as _working as intended_ for some obscure reasons (contradicting the answer from 2 months before)\n  - In #23807 (Oct. 2021), someones note that this started around Angular 11 and continues through Angular 12 and 13, and _**has been patched on v14**_, even if the issue was apparently related to PR #16512, which was merged for accessibility reasons, and maintainers indicated at that time they didn’t want to revert it\n  - In #25188 (June 2022), someone reports that \"clicked element contains cdk-program-focused class instead of cdk-mouse-focused\", got answered that it \"_Should've been fixed_ in #25232\", but linked PR doesn't seem to be about cdk-mouse-focused at all?\n  - In #31569 (July 2025), it's a bit different as it concerns menu items but still has the same issue: \"right click first item gets focus (which he should), but he also receive focus:visible ring design\". Another user points out that it may be related to \"the sequence of events the CDK sends to it\", but the issue died without any proper investigation.\n\n2. **Fixes attempted**\n  - The FocusMonitor bug #25188 (Jun 2022) where `cdk-program-focused` is incorrectly applied on mouse click was marked as completed\n  - The associated PR #25232 improved focus detection, especially when a label is clicked, but it doesn’t entirely solve the visual persistence issue for all components.\n\n3. **Version testing on the Angular Material doc site**\nAfter checking each latest minor version on the material.angular.dev website: \n- For checkboxes, the issue does not appear in earlier **latest** minor versions (before v15), but is present again from v15 onward (tested in v16, v17… up to v21 RC). A few issues also indicate this bug actually existed in version like v14 but got fixed before the latest minor, hence why I couldn't check it today.\n- For radio buttons, the bug is visible from v11 to v13, was fixed in v14 (see #23807), but was reintroduced somewhen during v15 until today\n\n4. **Accessibility & UX concerns**\n  - The persistent indicator can be confusing: after clicking, the element looks like it’s still “active” or focused, which might not reflect its real state\n  - Most other libraries I've checked fade out ripples after *mouse* click, so this behavior is surprising for people used to other websites\n- According to the CSS `:focus-visible` mechanism, focus indication should ideally reflect input modality (e.g. keyboard vs mouse). The MDN spec explains that `:focus-visible` is designed to show focus rings only when useful (e.g. keyboard navigation), precisely to differentiate when focus indicators should be shown depending on input modality (y'know, on the contrary to `:focus`...).\n- Persistent focus indicators can degrade usability or cause visual noise, especially in complex UI flows (I actually got several bug reports from customers confused by it)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-dqjhk5mq?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Angular Material (e.g. version 15+)\n2. Render a component like `<mat-radio-button>` or `<mat-checkbox>`\n3. Click the element with the mouse\n4. Observe that the ripple or focus ring stays visible after the click completes\n5. Click somewhere else (outside the element) to unfocus and notice how the focus indicator disappears\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After a mouse click, the ripple/focus indicator should fade out (or be removed) even if the component remains focused.\n- The behavior should be consistent across input types: mouse clicks vs keyboard interactions\n- Persistent focus indicators should align with modern focus pseudo-attributes (`:focus` vs `:focus-visible`), showing visible indicators only when needed and not “sticking” unnecessarily after click interactions\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Ripple or focus ring remains on the component after click and only goes away when the component loses focus (when clicking away)\n- This behavior is visible on both checkboxes, radio buttons and actual buttons\n- The bug has appeared, disappeared, and reappeared across versions, suggesting regression or incomplete fix\n\n### Environment\n\nDoesn't really matter that much but here's the linked Stackblitz env.\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Firefox 145.0\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11, macOS 26\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(focus): Persistent focus/ripple indicator stays visible on click\" (#32365)"},{"Id":"3634376919","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T17:59:48","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32364","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/combobox): escape key behavior","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32364","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(aria/combobox): escape key behavior\" (#32364)"},{"Id":"3633112280","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T12:23:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32363","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/select): render panel next to trigger","State":"open","Body":"Renders the select panel next to the trigger in order to keep it within the tab order and resolve some long-standing accessibility issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32363","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/select): render panel next to trigger\" (#32363)"},{"Id":"3631760260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T05:06:14","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32361","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency bazel to v7.7.1 (21.0.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| [bazel](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) | patch | `7.7.0` -> `7.7.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel (bazel)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.7.1`](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Release-771-2025-11-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/7.7.0...7.7.1)\n\n```\n\nRelease Notes:\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The responsibility of displaying error state requires leaning on additional control-flow syntax within the template.\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n      @if (!whenSuccess().error) {\r\n        <div>\r\n          Success\r\n        </div>\r\n      } @else {\r\n        <div>An error occured</div>\r\n      }\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error {\r\n      <div>Failed to load the defered js</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `} error {}` is not intuitive; `error` should simply allow for user-defined error-states in addition to failing to fetch scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nProposed solution is to allow the error statement to utilize `when` similar to `defer`'s `when` statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    @defer (when whenSuccess()) {\r\n    } @placeholder (minimum 2s) {\r\n      <p><strong>this is a placeholder...</strong></p>\r\n    } @error (whenSuccess().error) {\r\n      <div>{{ whenSuccess().error }}</div>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution to use `@if {} @else {}` is explored above.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Extend defer's error statement to include `when` semantics\" (#52196)"},{"Id":"1942854347","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-14T01:26:58","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"52208","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler-cli): compile signal inputs","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds the compiler mechanisms for signal inputs, without a runtime implementation.\r\n\r\nConspicuously missing here is a template type-checking implementation.

I'm putting a ticket here and officially with Heroku in hopes one of the two services in question understands what the issue is, and whether it's with their service (or more likely) with incorrect configuration on my end.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance -- first time using Angular Universal, and it's also my first time deploying to Heroku. Both seemed easy when I was testing them individually, but combining them for this project has been... aging.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate angular universal app and attempt to deploy it to Heroku using Heroku CLI.\r\n\r\nI build my projects, then deploy them to heroku. I do not add an explicit build step or package installation step within my `npm run start`, as I believe Heroku already handles these steps.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 20.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n\r\nWarning: The current version of Node (20.5.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n20.5.0 is the version of node that it installed for me.

There is currently a rule like this in `expanion-panel`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.scss#L78\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since `expanion-panel` has `ViewEncapsulation.None`, Angular won't limit the rule's scope using `[_nghost]`/`[_ngcontent]` attribute selectors, *and* Angular will copy the rule into any `ShadowDom`-encapsulated components.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.ts#L82\r\n\r\n###### *This issue was first noted [in this comment](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/c12347cafb18e900d19f613ce91afcca970d66d1#commitcomment-99447256).*\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-bsuofa?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Observe the animation is janky.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that `expansion-panel` is responsible:\r\n1. Delete the `<mat-expansion-panel>` element (and its children) from `example-component.html`.\r\n2. Reload (to force Angular to clear unused component styles).\r\n3. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that the `[style]` selector is responsible:\r\n1. Right-click > Inspect Element on \"expanstion panel contents\".\r\n3. In DevTools, ensure that `<div class=\"mat-expansion-panel-body\">` is selected.\r\n4. (optionally) Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 10,001 elements and takes a long time.\r\n5. Close the expansion panel.\r\n6. In DevTools, edit the CSS selector `.mat-expansion-panel-content[style*=\"visibility: hidden\"] *` to remove `[style*=...]`\r\n7. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n8. (optionally)  Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 1 element and is very fast.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth regardless of if an expansion panel exists or what the expansion panel component does internally.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth only after modifying an expansion-panel-internal CSS rule.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 19.9.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@angular/material               16.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27946","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion-panel): `[style*=...]` attribute selector causes whole-page slowdown in Chromium\" (#27946)"},{"Id":"1943760330","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-15T07:12:42","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27945","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch kitchen sink to standalone","State":"open","Body":"Switches the kitchen sink to standalone which allows us to get rid of some unnecessary files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27945","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: switch kitchen sink to standalone\" (#27945)"},{"Id":"1942775277","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T23:30:23","Actor":"zarend","Number":"27944","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/a11y): add example of LiveAnnouncer inside dialog","State":"open","Body":"Update the live-announcer demo in the dev-app. Add an example of calling LiveAnnouncer inside of a Dialog.

This means, that once Angular v17 is out, one would be forced to use the mdc-based components only.\r\n\r\nWhile this might have been a reasonable choice for your team - also conforming to your update and deprecation policies - there are codebases out there (including ours) that haven't migrated to the new components yet.\r\nReasons for that are probably diverse, but one major reasons for us was the knowledge about your efforts on eventually offering a brand-new token-based theming API.\r\n\r\nWe work on a bigger enterprise grade application with a design system that's based on customized material components. Due to limited official support for customizations on the current theming API (as of v16 with legacy components) , we tend to override a lot of (global) component styles.\r\nWhile eagerly waiting for the new token-based theming API to evolve and stabilize, we hoped to have the chance to upgrade directly to this new theming API, component by component.\r\nWith the discontinued support of legacy components in v17 however, this is now impossible and our migration path to the mdc-based components is very steep (either high effort or high risk).\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI can only see 2 options for us to move forward right now:\r\n\r\n1. While staying on v16, migrate each legacy component to the new mdc-based ones, component by component. This will require us to integrate with a new but still not latest theming API of the mdc-components first. After that migration is completed we would upgrade to v17 and have to re-integrate with the latest theming API once more, resulting in doubled theme integration effort. (high effort)\r\n2. Upgrade to v17 and migrate to mdc-based components at the same time. This would require us to migrate all components at once, which would tremendously increase the risk of the migration. However, we would only need to integrate with the latest theming API once. (high risk)\r\n\r\nIs there maybe another scenario that I am missing?\r\n\r\nIn case there's really no other way than these two, which I both consider as \"not ideal\", I would kindly ask you to re-consider still supporting legacy components in v17!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27942","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(multiple): still support legacy components in v17\" (#27942)"},{"Id":"1941173157","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T03:41:03","Actor":"thirumurugan-sundaram","Number":"27941","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): bug(mat-menu/mat-icon-button/radio-button/checkbox): Unable to reduce ripple size","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nangular material 14\n\n### Description\n\nFor a mat-menu icon or a  button of any size, the default ripple size is displayed.\r\n\r\nIn certain scenarios, we need to fit in the button in smaller UI.

(https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rumxmw?file=src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.html)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe ripple effect should be relative to the button, if the button size is 20px height and width, the ripple size of the button or the mat-menu-icon should be also 20px and should be contained within the mat-button . It should not overflow within the button wrapper .\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nif the button size is 20px height and width, the ripple size of the button or the mat-menu-icon is still 40px and its not contained within the mat-button .

However, if the user selects a new year fast enough the datepicker is still opening and animating (_isAnimating is true) and therefore the datepicker is not closed.  This was introduced in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25843\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `_isAnimating` property and the `_animationDone` subject are both not exposed through public API so we cannot wait for the animation to be finished to close the picker. However, exposing it would be not a good solution as this would require us to have knowledge of the internals of the component to implement the solution. Rather, the datepicker should be fixed so the close event is scheduled for after when the animation is finished.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nIt simulates opening the datepicker and then closing it very fast through setTimeout to visualize the issue.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/datepicker-bug-material\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nEither datepicker will close even if animating or datepicker will be scheduled for closing so it closes at the end of the animation.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nDatepicker is not closing while animating\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.2.8\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 117.0.5938.149  - all browsers.\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs 13.2.1  - all operating systems\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27920","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-datepicker): Datepicker cannot be closed when animating\" (#27920)"},{"Id":"1930774687","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T19:13:35","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"27917","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrate snapshots jobs to GHA","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27917","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Migrate snapshots jobs to GHA\" (#27917)"},{"Id":"1930810132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T19:13:27","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"27918","RawContent":null,"Title":"Complete migration to GHA","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27918","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Complete migration to GHA\" (#27918)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-10-16T03:30:02.8152157Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1919}

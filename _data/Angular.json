Two GraphQL requests, with the same URL, are being fired on the server-side. When hydration kicks in on the client-side, the same response body is restored for the both requests, leading to an error since data structures expected for each response do not match. Disabling Javascript (effectively blocking rehydration) renders the page correctly, with both a movie name and a character name.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to add a dummy request param to one of the URLs, but this is not practical for real life projects where the number of requests can grow rapidly.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ahmadshahwan/angular-ssr-with-post-request-cache-transfer\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n`main-L2QLRZ2I.js:7 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')` in the clients console due to data structure mismatch between what is expected in the response body, and what is returned from the transferred cache.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.3\r\nNode: 21.2.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis issue was originally reported [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77521480/angular-ssr-app-cache-only-one-http-request) (not by me), but it didn't seem to catch much attention.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR with POST requests cache transfer enable is buggy when multiple POST-requests are sent to the same URL, with different bodies\" (#54377)"},{"Id":"2128712024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-10T20:59:46","Actor":"simeyla","Number":"54376","RawContent":null,"Title":"Signals: viewChildren() gets new values even when query list is unchanged, and performance is hampered by lack of a 'static' option","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTraditionally only `@ViewChild` and `@ContentChild` has had a `static` option. \r\n`@ViewChildren` and `@ContentChildren` do not, however there isn't really a good reason given. The best information I could find was:\r\n\r\n> @[ViewChildren](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChildren) and @[ContentChildren](https://angular.io/api/core/ContentChildren) queries are already \"dynamic\" by default and don't support static resolution. \r\n\r\nTraditionally the `static` option is useful to developers because it allows for the value of `@ViewChild` [to be consumed in ngOnInit](https://angular.io/guide/static-query-migration#what-does-this-flag-mean). There is also an additional performance benefit too since it only ever gets calculated once, even if for most components this would be negligible.\r\n\r\nThere is another (deprecated) option '`emitDistinctChangesOnly`' for `@ViewChildren`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChildren) intended to only emit a new if the `QueryList` has actually changed. I haven't looked into the details of this, but I'm assuming it does some kind of identity comparison for items in the `QueryList`. \r\n\r\nWhen playing with the new `viewChildren()` signal in Angular 17.2 I found that the signal yields duplicate values even if the list has not changed. You can get an infinite loop if this value is used in certain ways in the template because Angular keeps recalculating it:\r\n\r\n> Error: NG0103: Infinite change detection while trying to refresh views. \r\n\r\nIn the attached example my app component behaves as a custom grid control. There are a number of `<ng-template column-template></ng-template>` columns defined, that are captured to a signal via `viewChildren(ColumnTemplateDirective)`. In my real project the component uses `mat-table` but in this example I just output the list of columns.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when stamping out the columns new views are created, which causes `viewChildren` to be recalculated. Even though the list of `ColumnTemplateDirective` is unchanged it 'emits' a new value causing the infinite loop.\r\n\r\n### Notes about my repro\r\nOpen stackblitz console to see the error\r\n\r\nMy reproduction of this issue can easily be 'fixed' and I am well aware of ways in which it could be.\r\n\r\n1) I could create a `computed` with a custom equals that takes the `viewChildren` list and ignores duplicate values.\r\n2) The `@for` in my repro that iterates through the `columns` computed signal uses object identity. If changed to `track col.id` then the problem goes away because the template inside doesn't keep getting recreated. \r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what triggers `viewChildren` to recalculate itself, but I had to add an extra 'scope' with `@if (true)` in order to trigger it to do so. \r\n\r\nFrankly it was harder to create this repro than I expected. It was much easier with `mat-table` to trigger the infinite loop, but I wanted to stay within core for the repro.\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nUltimately what I would hope to see is two things:\r\n\r\n1) Identity checking of elements returned from `viewChildren()` such that unchanged children do not update the signal value.\r\n2) A way to use something like `static` for `viewChildren()` in order to only calculate the list one time. I don't think it would make sense for `contentChildren()`. This would primarily be for performance reasons when needing to capture `viewChildren` that are known to be static. This was easier before with `QueryList` that was an observable.\r\n\r\nI can easily work around the duplicate viewChildren value, but I am more concerned about performance especially since my component displays a grid with thousands of cells and Angular is probably continuously looking through the whole table for new templates. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-model-inputs-mv3bsn\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0103: Infinite change detection while trying to refresh views.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular: 17.2.0-rc.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals: viewChildren() gets new values even when query list is unchanged, and performance is hampered by lack of a 'static' option\" (#54376)"},{"Id":"2128660439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-10T20:06:23","Actor":"dentiman","Number":"54374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Proposal: Create new <ng-host> html element as root element in template for more native hostBinding","State":"closed","Body":"General idea is to keep host binding properties as attributes for new root <ng-host> element in\r\ncomponent template instead of using @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators or host metadata property in @Component decorator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current host binding\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-button',\r\n  templateUrl: './app-button.component.html',\r\n  host: {\r\n    '[class]': 'class',\r\n    '(click)': 'handleClick()',\r\n    '[attr.disabled]': 'disabled'\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal host binding\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-button',\r\n  template: `\r\n        <ng-host class=\"...\" (click)=\"handleClick()\" [disabled]=\"disabled\"  >\r\n            <div>Content</div>\r\n        </ng-host>\r\n`\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n- Attribute autocomplete better in html than in .ts file\r\n- better readability, especially when we have long static css class  list\r\n- no need to use @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators or host property in @Component decorator\r\n\r\nrelated to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19119","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54374","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Create new <ng-host> html element as root element in template for more native hostBinding\" (#54374)"},{"Id":"2128677862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-10T19:16:15","Actor":"vladboisa","Number":"54375","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): fix tab shrinking","State":"open","Body":"Fix a behavior when block shrinks on Usage notes tab\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It has several flaws that make it an insufficient change detection mechanism:\r\n\r\n* It runs change detection for the component under test _after_ views attached to the `ApplicationRef`. This can cause real behavior differences that break in production, because tests can observe view refreshes in the incorrect order (for example, a dialog refreshing before the component which opened it).\r\n* Because of the above ordering, render hooks registered during change detection of the fixture views _will not execute at all_ because `ApplicationRef.tick` already happen.\r\n* It does not rerun change detection on the view tree if there are more dirty views to refresh after the render hooks complete.\r\n* It effectively hides/swallows errors from change detection inside the `onMicrotaskEmpty` subscription by not reporting them to the error handler. Instead, this error ends up being unhandled in the subscription and rxjs throws these in a `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\nAll of the above are problematic but this commit _does not_ fix the final point. Ideally, we can land this in a future change but this requires additional internal fixes. In the meantime, we have to juggle special-case handling of the component fixture views within `ApplicationRef.tick` using some special events to retain current behavior and avoid errors from the fixture propagating to the `ErrorHandler`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54354","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): ComponentFixture autodetect should detect changes within ApplicationRef.tick\" (#54354)"},{"Id":"2125907383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T19:20:36","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"54352","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: migrate router to prettier formatting","State":"closed","Body":"Migrate formatting to prettier for router from clang-format\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54352","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: migrate router to prettier formatting\" (#54352)"},{"Id":"2125841243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T18:43:04","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"54351","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v17.3.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the release-candidate phase.

This option allows global identifiers present in the code to be replaced with another value at build time. This is similar to the behavior of Webpack's `DefinePlugin` which was previously used with some custom Webpack configurations that used third-party builders. The option has similar capabilities to the `esbuild` option of the same name. The documentation for that option can be found here: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define \r\nThe command line capabilities of the Angular CLI option are not yet implemented and will added in a future change.\r\n\r\nThe option within the `angular.json` configuration file is of the form of an object. The keys of the object represent the global identifier to replace and the values of the object represent the corresponding replacement value for the identifier. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"define\": {\r\n    \"SOME_CONSTANT\": \"5\",\r\n    \"ANOTHER\": \"'this is a string literal'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll replacement values are defined as strings within the configuration file. If the replacement is intended to be an actual string literal, it should be enclosed in single quote marks. This allows the flexibility of using any valid JSON type as well as a different identifier as a replacement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, TypeScript needs to be aware of the types to prevent type-checking\r\nerrors during the build. This can be accomplished with an additional type definition file within the\r\napplication source code (`src/types.d.ts`, for example) with the following or similar content:\r\n```\r\ndeclare const SOME_CONSTANT: number;\r\ndeclare const ANOTHER: string;\r\n```\r\nThe default project configuration is already setup to use any type definition files present in the\r\nproject source directories. If the TypeScript configuration for the project has been altered, the\r\ntsconfig may need to be adjusted to reference this newly added type definition file.\r\n\r\nAn important caveat to the option is that it does not function when used with values contained within Angular metadata such as a Component or Directive decorator. This limitation was present with previous third-party builder usage as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27047","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add define build option to application builder\" (#27047)"},{"Id":"2122265322","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T17:34:12","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27048","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [chokidar](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar) | devDependencies | minor | [`3.5.3` -> `3.6.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/chokidar/3.5.3/3.6.0) |\n| [postcss](https://postcss.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss)) | dependencies | patch | [`8.4.34` -> `8.4.35`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/postcss/8.4.34/8.4.35) |\n| [postcss](https://postcss.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss)) | devDependencies | patch | [`8.4.34` -> `8.4.35`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/postcss/8.4.34/8.4.35) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | dependencies | patch | [`6.6.1` -> `6.6.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.6.1/6.6.2) |\n| [undici](https://undici.nodejs.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici)) | devDependencies | patch | [`6.6.1` -> `6.6.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/undici/6.6.1/6.6.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>paulmillr/chokidar (chokidar)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.6.0`](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/releases/tag/3.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/compare/3.5.3...3.6.0)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   fix readyCount logic by [@&#8203;JLHwung](https://togithub.com/JLHwung) in [https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1288](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1288)\n-   handle MustScanSubDirs by [@&#8203;MarcCelani-at](https://togithub.com/MarcCelani-at) in [https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1197](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/1197)\n-   update fs.FSWatcher types to satisfy nodejs versions >= 16;

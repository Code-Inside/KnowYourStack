I would like to be able to do something like this:\n\nMain component template\n```html\n<my-list>\n    <my-list-item>List Item 1</my-list-item>\n    <my-list-item>List Item 2</my-list-item>\n    <my-list-item>List Item 3 <input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"myBoundVariable\" /></my-list-item>\n</my-list>\n```\n\n`my-list.component.ts`\n```typescript\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-list',\n    template: `\n        @for (item of listItems();; track item) {\n            <!-- item's content projected here with component's wrapping tag -->\n            @if (!$last) {\n                <hr />\n            }\n        }\n`\n})\nexport class MyListComponent {\n    listItems = contentChildren(MyListItemComponent);\n}\n```\n`my-list-item.component.ts`\n```typescript\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-list-item',\n    template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,\n    styles: [':host { display: block; border: solid 1px red; }'],\n})\nexport class MyListItemComponent {}\n```\n\nThe desired end result would be\n```html\n<my-list>\n    <my-list-item>List Item 1</my-list-item>\n    <hr />\n    <my-list-item>List Item 2</my-list-item>\n    <hr />\n    <my-list-item>List Item 3 <input type=\"text\" /></my-list-item>\n</my-list>\n```\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBe able to pass the result of a Signal or QueryList to `ng-content` or another new addition to place specific instances of content children iteratively.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe current alternative is to pass whether the child is the last in the list via an input. This can become repetitive and adds additional effort for each component this kind of processing might need. Being able to iteratively project instead of just everything via `ng-content` or `ng-content` with `selector` would be very beneficial.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61095","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow for iterative content projection with content children\" (#61095)"},{"Id":"3034795117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T22:01:38","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61094","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CDK apis [main]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CDK api files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61094","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CDK apis [main]\" (#61094)"},{"Id":"3034795096","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T22:01:37","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61093","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CDK apis [19.2.x]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CDK api files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61093","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CDK apis [19.2.x]\" (#61093)"},{"Id":"3034795002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T22:01:35","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61092","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CDK apis [20.0.x]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CDK api files.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61092","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CDK apis [20.0.x]\" (#61092)"},{"Id":"3032763861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T22:00:46","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"61081","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add a script to copy cdk api files to adev","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61081","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: add a script to copy cdk api files to adev\" (#61081)"},{"Id":"3034503497","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T21:59:27","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61089","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): Mark inputs of deprecated control flow directives aâ€¦","State":"closed","Body":"â€¦s deprecated\r\n\r\nThis updates the inputs of the deprecated control flow directives as also deprecated.

When using SSR and commonly Angular Material, the sass compiler throws an error. I traced it back to `zone.js` patching the `Promise` which is being used inside the `sass-embedded` package used for sass compilation.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Clone the repo\n2. Run `npm install`.\n3. Run `npx vite` or `npx ng serve`.\n4. Visit the local development URL.\n5. Note the error shown above.\n\nWorkarounds:\nUse Zoneless change detection and not load `zone.js/node` in the `main.server.ts` file.\n\nOr\n\nConfigure Vite to use the legacy sass compiler\n\n```ts\n/// <reference types=\"vitest\" />\n\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport analog from '@analogjs/platform';\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({\n  build: {\n    target: ['es2020'],\n  },\n  css: {\n    preprocessorOptions: {\n      scss: {\n        api: 'legacy' // fixes the error, but displays deprecation warnings\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    mainFields: ['module'],\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    analog(),\n  ],\n}));\n```\n\nUsing the modern sass compiler out of the box is preferred.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/brandonroberts/analog-angular-material-zonejs\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n<img width=\"1179\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e5a7a8-e89a-4353-91dc-c481910d7c6e\" />\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.10\n@angular/build                  19.2.10\n@angular/cdk                    19.2.14\n@angular/cli                    19.2.10\n@angular/material               19.2.14\n@schematics/angular             19.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nUsing Analog 1.16.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61090","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Importing zone.js/node and using modern sass compiler throws an error with Vite/AnalogJS\" (#61090)"},{"Id":"3034371074","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T17:54:57","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"61088","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] Initial PR for migration to rules_js ","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61088","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[PATCH] Initial PR for migration to rules_js \" (#61088)"},{"Id":"3034341597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T17:36:38","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"61087","RawContent":null,"Title":"Initial PR for migration to `rules_js`","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61087","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial PR for migration to `rules_js`\" (#61087)"},{"Id":"3033852900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T17:31:48","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"61084","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies to v20.0.0-next.10","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | patch | [`20.0.0-next.8` -> `20.0.0-next.10`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk/20.0.0-next.8/20.0.0-next.10) |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | patch | [`20.0.0-next.8` -> `20.0.0-next.10`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/20.0.0-next.8/20.0.0-next.10) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.10`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next10-sodium-swallow-2025-05-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.0.0-next.9...20.0.0-next.10)\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.9`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next9-sodium-salamander-2025-05-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/20.0.0-next.8...20.0.0-next.9)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### cdk\n\n-   -

In this case the initial `status` of the form control changes from `VALID` to `INVALID`, as expected, but no `statusChanges` event is emitted.\n\nThe same behaviour is also present, when setting the form value programatically outside of user interactions, e.g., in life-cycle methods such a `ngOnInit`.\n\nWhen there is, however, a value change triggered by direct user interaction or indirect user interaction, e.g., pressing a button that programmatically sets the form value, the expected status is emitted as `statusChange`.\n\nNote that whenever `statusChanges` are unexpectedly not emitted a corresponding `events` emission is also missing.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-query-aqv6yuzm-vfbygddo?file=package.json,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nException: Form status changes from `VALID` to `INVALID` while emitting a `statusChanges` event.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.10\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.10\n@angular/build               19.2.10\n@angular/cli                 19.2.10\n@schematics/angular          19.2.10\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn case this is expected behaviour, it should be mentioned in the documentation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61082","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Directive Validators Not Emitting StatusChanges\" (#61082)"},{"Id":"3033276229","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T09:33:04","Actor":"egonknapen","Number":"61083","RawContent":null,"Title":"Keep the ngIf + ngFor, don't deprecate them","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe new preferred syntax (@if, @for), although nice in some cases, turns the template into a tangled, unreadable mess, stripping away its clarity and charm.\n\nIf you like me have heavy use of lots of *ngIf below each other, the whole template gets filled with { ... }.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.8...20.0.0-next.9)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   the `TestBed.flushEffects()` was removed - use\n    the `TestBed.tick()` instead.\n-   `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` has several\n    breaking changes:\n    -   It is renamed to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig`\n    -   The behavior applies to *all* checkNoChanges runs\n    -   The `useNgZoneOnStable` option is removed. This wasn't found to be generally\n        more useful than `interval`\n-   afterRender was renamed to afterEveryRender.\n-   This commit deprecates `ng-reflect-*` attributes and updates the runtime to stop producing them by default. Please refactor application and test code to avoid relying on `ng-reflect-*` attributes.\n\n    To enable a more seamless upgrade to v20, we've added the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function (can be imported from the `@angular/core` package), which enables the mode in which Angular would be producing those attribites (in dev mode only). You can add the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function to the list of providers within the bootstrap call.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b7d3f3dbfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/b7d3f3dbfcfc40000ca34087d3b8b42319468177) | feat | Allow passing ScrollOptions to ViewportScroller ([#&#8203;61002](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61002)) |\n| [fc4a56d5c5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/fc4a56d5c5fa270dbb1402c7cafe6d4f2af571eb) | fix | rename httpResource function in factory ([#&#8203;60022](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60022)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c889382a20](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c889382a2044f9a024f475680c8573d0f7112562) | feat | detect missing structural directive imports ([#&#8203;59443](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59443)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d5fd7349fb](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d5fd7349fb8b3942f0727cd7ee62e7a7b231e9e4) | feat | introduce TestBed.tick() ([#&#8203;60993](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60993)) |\n| [e711f99d81](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e711f99d81ea7dbd4526f859c363244fccdf0626) | feat | move `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig` ([#&#8203;60906](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60906)) |\n| [d8fbb909ce](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d8fbb909ce4380c0ea48512cf5d364a2785fd428) | feat | rename afterRender to afterEveryRender and stabilize ([#&#8203;60999](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60999)) |\n| [8d82a39a60](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d82a39a601fbedee58f140a7432c4adf0b054ff) | fix | async EventEmitter error should not prevent stability ([#&#8203;61028](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61028)) |\n| [624be2ef0c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/624be2ef0c7255e62082751cc339d2cd618bd633) | fix | prevent stash listener conflicts ([#&#8203;59635](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59635)) |\n| [c2987d8402](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c2987d8402b7b03333b0081a7f97750cdf612e99) | refactor | stop producing `ng-reflect` attributes by default ([#&#8203;60973](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60973)) |\n\n##### http\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [ccc5cc068f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ccc5cc068f788013c19498c44d13530c1bc98912) | feat | add keepalive support for fetch requests ([#&#8203;60621](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60621)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This leads to the following error if the `isMainModule` guard is removed from `server.ts`:\n```text\nError: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4000\n```\nIn my case, I must remove the `isMainModule` check to support deployment via iisnode on Azure, but doing so causes this build issue.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRemove `isMainModule` check from` server.ts:\n```typescript\n...\nconst port = process.env['PORT'] || 4000;\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n```\n\nHave multiple routes with `renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender` on `app.routes.server.ts`.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n`Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4000`\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.8\nNode: 18.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: win32 x64\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30202","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`ng build` re-runs server multiple times when multiple routes use `RenderMode.Prerender` in `app.routes.server.ts`\" (#30202)"},{"Id":"3029968410","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T02:49:08","Actor":"ekrapfl","Number":"30198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unit tests using esbuild + Vite fail when reloading using Sqlite wasm","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nCurrent Angular (19.x), but not using Application Builder for Karma\n\n### Description\n\nUnit tests using esbuild + Vite fail when reloading using Sqlite wasm.\n\n- App is configured to use esbuild + Vite for unit testing with Jasmine + Karma.\n- App imports Sqlite one way in production, but in tests, it is loaded via wasm in order to test Sql code.\n- Start the test run with `npm test`.\n- It will build the app and run the tests successfully once.\n  - You will see a log in the output that says: `wasm size: 739,512 bytes`.\n- Open `sqlite-db.service.spec.ts` and save.\n- This should rebuild the tests and you will see a failure:\n  ```\n  failed to asynchronously prepare wasm: CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): section (code 1, \"Type\") extends past end of the module (length 9396207, remaining bytes 828774) @+8\n  ```\n  - You will see a log in the output that says `wasm size: 828,787 bytes`.\n- The size of the actual file being read from disk matches the first logged size, and it does not change when you save.\n- The actual file can be found at `dist/test-out/**/sql-wasm-debug.wasm`, and you can see its size does not change.

Also, there are cases where someone want to use internal icons instead of the material ones.\n\n### Use Case\n\n- A toggle for dark and light themes displaying sun and moon icons.\n- Mute and unmute slide toggle.\n- Disable or enable notifications.\n\nPretty much every use case can benefit from this.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30982","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(slide-toggle): add ability to change slide-toggle icons\" (#30982)"},{"Id":"3030126106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T07:23:50","Actor":"kjteh","Number":"30984","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(form-field): Extra space in Outline MatFormField Notch when label content is empty","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nExtra space in Outline MatFormField Notch when the width of the label is 0. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009a71fb-9d1d-4341-9c1f-460a850f025a)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-otgsx4ue?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe extra space (padding-right: 8px) **SHOULD BE REMOVED** if the label content is empty, when\n- floatLabel = always OR \n- floatLabel = auto AND there is value filled in to the form field.\n\n\nThe padding-right is being set by following css class: \n.mdc-notched-outline--notched .mdc-notched-outline__notch\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe extra space (padding-right: 8px) is **VISIBLE** despite the label content is empty, when\n- floatLabel = always OR \n- floatLabel = auto AND there is value filled in to the form field.\n\n### Environment\n\n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.2\nNode: 18.20.4\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.4.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.2\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.2\n@angular/cdk                    19.2.3\n@angular/material               19.2.3\n@schematics/angular             19.2.2\nng-packagr                      19.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30984","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(form-field): Extra space in Outline MatFormField Notch when label content is empty\" (#30984)"},{"Id":"3029633142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-29T22:07:38","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"30983","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): provide ability to edit for all screen readers with a click on already focused chip","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30983","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/chips): provide ability to edit for all screen readers with a click on already focused chip\" (#30983)"},{"Id":"3029439176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-29T21:12:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30981","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix patch CI","State":"closed","Body":"#30978 was cherry-picked into the patch branch, but it's using APIs that aren't available in v19.

We were parsing and sanitizing the generated html, and as part of that sanitization, it would rewrite element ids to prevent dom-clobbering attacks. \n\nSpecifically, if a generated html element is as follows\n`<h2 id=\"some-heading-id\">`\nthen the output would be\n`<h2 id=\"user-content-some-heading-id\">`\n\n\nObviously, this would break links, because `demo.com/some-document#some-heading-id` would no longer work, and we would have to use `demo.com/some-document#user-content-some-heading-id` instead. Except, now the links don't look like what my client would want for SEO and it would break existing links.\n\nSo to work around this, I modified the behaviour of ViewportScroller (see [customize-viewport-scroller.ts](#customize-viewport-scroller.ts)).\n\n\nNow, the thing to note is that I had to:\n- copy over the implementation of `findAnchorFromDocument` from the `@angular/common` library\n- provide type information for `BrowserViewportScroller` \n\n<details id=\"customize-viewport-scroller.ts\">\n<summary>\n <strong>customize-viewport-scroller.ts</strong>\n</summary>\n<p>\n\n```ts\nimport { ViewportScroller } from '@angular/common';\nimport { afterNextRender, inject, INJECTOR, provideAppInitializer } from '@angular/core';\nimport { isServer } from '../utilities/platform-type';\n\n\nexport function customizeProvidedViewportScroller() {\n  return provideAppInitializer(() => {\n    if (isServer()) return;\n\n    const injector = inject(INJECTOR);\n\n    type BrowserViewportScroller = ViewportScroller & {\n      document: Document,\n      scrollToElement: (element: HTMLElement, options?: ScrollOptions) => void;\n    };\n\n    const scroller = inject(ViewportScroller) as BrowserViewportScroller;\n\n    function scrollToAnchor(this: BrowserViewportScroller, target: string, options?: ScrollOptions) {\n      const elSelected = findAnchorFromDocument(this.document, target);\n\n      if (elSelected) {\n        this.scrollToElement(elSelected, options);\n        elSelected.focus();\n      }\n      else {\n        if (target.startsWith('user-content-')) {\n          afterNextRender(() => {\n            this.scrollToAnchor(target, options);\n          }, { injector });\n        }\n        else {\n          target = `user-content-${target}`;\n          this.scrollToAnchor(target, options);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    scroller.scrollToAnchor = scrollToAnchor.bind(scroller);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction findAnchorFromDocument(document: Document, target: string) {\n  const documentResult = document.getElementById(target) || document.getElementsByName(target)[0];\n  if (documentResult) {\n    return documentResult;\n  }\n  // `getElementById` and `getElementsByName` won't pierce through the shadow DOM so we\n  // have to traverse the DOM manually and do the lookup through the shadow roots.\n  if (typeof document.createTreeWalker === 'function' &&\n    document.body &&\n    typeof document.body.attachShadow === 'function') {\n    const treeWalker = document.createTreeWalker(document.body, NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT);\n    let currentNode: Node | null = treeWalker.currentNode;\n    while (currentNode) {\n      const shadowRoot = (currentNode as Element).shadowRoot;\n      if (shadowRoot) {\n        // Note that `ShadowRoot` doesn't support `getElementsByName`\n        // so we have to fall back to `querySelector`.\n        const result = shadowRoot.getElementById(target) || shadowRoot.querySelector(`[name=\"${target}\"]`);\n        if (result) {\n          return result;\n        }\n      }\n      currentNode = treeWalker.nextNode();\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nthe above will be a pain to maintain, because they may go out of sync as angular updates\n- if you expose `findAnchorFromDocument` as a utility, then I can just import it and not have to maintain a user-land copy\n- if you expose `BrowserViewportScroller` I can do an `if (scroller instanceof BrowserViewportScroller) { }` and remove my type declarations, or even better - I could even simply extend and override the class instead of doing function binding\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"expose BrowserViewportScroller and findAnchorFromDocument\" (#64748)"},{"Id":"3563879614","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-29T00:24:03","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64747","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): improve discoverability of ValidationError flavors","State":"open","Body":"Improves discoverability by putting the WithField, WithoutField, etc as subtypes of the main ValidationError type\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64747","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(forms): improve discoverability of ValidationError flavors\" (#64747)"},{"Id":"3563850982","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-29T00:09:23","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"64746","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(forms): make FIELD experimental","State":"open","Body":"Adds `@experimental` tag to `FIELD`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64746","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(forms): make FIELD experimental\" (#64746)"},{"Id":"3563722730","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-28T23:15:16","Actor":"lukasmatta","Number":"64745","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): Do not remove a template if it is referenced with a trailing semicolon","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

From the error, it would appear even angular thinks it should be there.\n\nHere's the old code: **NO PROBLEMS**\n```\n@for (thread of messageThreadsFullHalfService.threads; track trackByThreadProperties($index, thread)) {\n  <button #threadRef\n          id=\"{{ 'id' + thread.threadId }}\"\n          class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action p-0 min-height-animate\"\n          (mouseup)=\"threadRef.blur()\"\n          [@animateOnRemove]=\"thread.removeAnimate\"\n          (@animateOnRemove.done)=\"animateOnRemoveDone$.next()\">\n...\n```\nand the new: **CAUSES ERROR**\n```\n@for (thread of messageThreadsFullHalfService.threads; track trackByThreadProperties($index, thread)) {\n  <button #threadRef\n          id=\"{{ 'id' + thread.threadId }}\"\n          class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action p-0 min-height-animate\"\n          (mouseup)=\"threadRef.blur()\"\n          [animate.leave]=\"'remove-x-easy-animation time-300 distance-n100'\"\n          [class.instant-animation]=\"!thread.removeAnimate\"\n          (animate.leave)=\"AnimationUtilities.onAnimationDone($event, onThreadRemoveAnimationDoneFunc, unsub$)\">\n...\n```\n\nAnimationUtilities.onAnimationDone:\n```\n  static onAnimationDone($event: AnimationCallbackEvent, callback: Function, unsub$: Subject<void>): void {\n    const animations = $event.target.getAnimations();\n    if (animations.length) {\n      merge(...animations.map(animation => from(animation.finished))).pipe(\n        takeUntil(unsub$)\n      ).subscribe({\n        complete: () => {\n          callback();\n          $event.animationComplete();\n        }\n      });\n    } else {\n      callback();\n      $event.animationComplete();\n      // currently angular will not remove the element if there is no animations and the (animate.leave) event fired.\n      $event.target.remove();\n    }\n  }\n```\n(I have confirmed beyond any doubt that there IS an animation firing and the `if (animations.length)` is true and we start the subscription to the `animations.finished` promise and the `else` with the `$event.target.remove();` is not run. —Of course it's also easy to just comment that out, but for the sake of my issue title, I'm including that I have seen this `(animate.leave)` event firing with NO animations, and this is a necessary line. Another bug.)\n\n`.instant-animation` is `animation-duration: 1ms`, which I have found is more consistent than the `animation: none` recommendation in the docs. `.min-height-animate` is a transition of `min-height` which does not fire when the element is removed. \n\n### Full Description:\nTo the point of the problem though, a change is made in the array `messageThreadsFullHalfService.threads`. Some elements should be leaving (and do) but the element that causes the error should NOT be removed—confirmed in the trackby function—, yet it is being removed by the animate.leave effects—confirmed if you remove the `animate.leave`'s completely. I then change the `messageThreadsFullHalfService.threads` back to its original state and the error pops up because the element should be there but it's not.\n\nThree things fix this: 1) If we remove both the `animate.leave`'s there is no error and the element exists after the change. 2) If we change the trackby to essentially rebuild all elements there is no error and the element exists after the change. 3) If I use the old code's animation system:\n```\n    trigger('animateOnRemove', [\n      transition('true => void', [\n        animate('300ms ease-in',\n          style({transform: 'translateX(-100%)'})\n        )\n      ])\n    ])\n```\nthere is no error and the element exists after the change.\n\nI spent nearly 6 hours trying to reproduce in a new repo, but was unsuccessful. It's a rather intense array of many complex elements, but despite adding many rows of complexity to the repo, I couldn't reproduce. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nroot_effect_scheduler.mjs:3624 ERROR NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.\n    at EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2.insertBefore (dom_renderer.mjs:645:20)\n    at AnimationRenderer.insertBefore (browser.mjs:3852:19)\n    at nativeInsertBefore (debug_node.mjs:6790:14)\n    at applyToElementOrContainer (debug_node.mjs:8289:13)\n    at applyNodes (debug_node.mjs:8884:17)\n    at applyView (debug_node.mjs:8891:5)\n    at addViewToDOM (debug_node.mjs:8341:5)\n    at addLViewToLContainer (debug_node.mjs:10446:13)\n    at LiveCollectionLContainerImpl.attach (debug_node.mjs:23150:9)\n    at attachPreviouslyDetached (debug_node.mjs:22802:24)\nhandleError @ root_effect_scheduler.mjs:3624\n(anonymous) @ debug_node.mjs:30771\ninvoke @ zone.js:398\nrun @ zone.js:113\nrunOutsideAngular @ debug_node.mjs:7741\n(anonymous) @ debug_node.mjs:30763\n(anonymous) @ debug_node.mjs:30699\ninvoke @ zone.js:398\nonInvoke @ debug_node.mjs:7850\ninvoke @ zone.js:397\nrun @ zone.js:113\nrun @ debug_node.mjs:7696\nnext @ debug_node.mjs:30693\nConsumerObserver2.next @ Subscriber.js:96\nSubscriber2._next @ Subscriber.js:63\nSubscriber2.next @ Subscriber.js:34\n(anonymous) @ Subject.js:41\nerrorContext @ errorContext.js:19\nSubject2.next @ Subject.js:31\nemit @ debug_node.mjs:7384\ncheckStable @ debug_node.mjs:7764\nonLeave @ debug_node.mjs:7911\nonInvokeTask @ debug_node.mjs:7844\ninvokeTask @ zone.js:430\nrunTask @ zone.js:161\ninvokeTask @ zone.js:515\ninvokeTask @ zone.js:1141\nglobalCallback @ zone.js:1172\nglobalZoneAwareCallback @ zone.js:1205\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.7\nNode: 22.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.3\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.7\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... elements, forms, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.7\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.7\n@angular/cdk                    20.2.9\n@angular/material               20.2.9\n@schematics/angular             20.3.7\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.9.2\nzone.js                         0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nHonestly, this might be more of a feedback post rather than a true hope of fixing an issue. After attempting to remove the deprecated animation module in a 14MB, 2500 file large application, I'm posting this issue with a general sentiment of frustration for the planned deprecation of a working system in favor of this new limited replacement. In just one file I replaced 178 lines of animation code (yes it was complex menu component) into 427 lines of code because of the removal of the UNREPLACED functionality of `query`, `stagger`, `sequence`, `animateChild`, and `group` and the complexity of switching from `(@trigger.start)` and `(@trigger.done)` events to the `(animate.leave)` event. I also sit here with heavily eroded trust in the safety of upgrading angular version as this was released rather buggy and not production ready.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"animate.leave is as buggy as a nursery log in a rain forest\" (#64730)"},{"Id":"3562260092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-28T15:58:51","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"64729","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update ng-dev config and pullapprove","State":"open","Body":"This updates the pullapprove to remove the auto labeling of requires: TGP and instead moves it to the ng-dev config for pr updates.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64729","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: update ng-dev config and pullapprove\" (#64729)"},{"Id":"3561951449","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-28T15:55:52","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"64726","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): allow cors for json files","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #64710\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64726","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): allow cors for json files\" (#64726)"},{"Id":"3562021377","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-28T15:04:49","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"64728","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use pointer cursor for interactive clickable areas","State":"open","Body":"Improves UX by applying cursor: pointer to clickable elements in the docs, ensuring the cursor correctly reflects interactivity.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So the above code works with a service like:\n`auth.service.ts`\n```typescript \n@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})\nexport class AuthService {\n  private readonly http = inject(HttpClient);\n  logon(username: string, password: string) {\n    return this.http.post('/api/logon', {username, password});\n  }\n  validateSession(username: string, password: string) {\n    return this.http.get('/api/whoami');\n  }\n}\n```\nHowever in a test using the HttpTestingController e.g.  \n`auth.interceptor.spec.ts`\n```typescript\nit('should not intercept logon requests') {\n  const http = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);\n  const authService = TestBed.inject(AuthService);\n  let receivedError: unknown;\n  authService.logon('user', 'pass').subscribe({\n    error: (error) => receivedError = error;\n  });\n  const req = controller.expectOne('/api/logon');\n  req.flush({}, {status: 401, statusText: 'Unauthorized'});\n  expect(receivedError).toBeInstanceOf(HttpErrorResponse);\n  if (receivedError instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\n    expect(receivedError.status).toBe(401);\n    expect(receivedError.statusText).toBe('Unauthorized');\n  }\n});\n```\nInstead `receivedError` is \"TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL\".

It was only defined if `coverage: true` was set, and it consolidated several top-level `coverage*` properties from the schema. This required downstream consumers, like the Karma and Vitest executors, to handle a potentially undefined object and led to complex and sometimes incorrect option merging, especially in the Vitest runner.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the option normalization logic to ensure the `coverage` object is *always* defined. A new `enabled` flag, controlled by the main `coverage` option, is now part of this object.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31622","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/build): normalize unit test coverage options for consistency\" (#31622)"},{"Id":"3563733053","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-28T23:19:31","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31621","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): introduce vitest-base.config for test configuration","State":"open","Body":"When using the Vitest runner, a standard `vitest.config.js` file can cause conflicts with other tools or IDE extensions that might assume it represents a complete, standalone configuration. However, the builder uses this file only as a *base* configuration, which is then merged with its own internal setup.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this ambiguity, the builder now searches for a `vitest-base.config.(js|ts|...etc)` file when the `runnerConfig` option is set to `true`. This makes the intent clear that the file provides a base configuration specifically for the Angular CLI builder.\r\n\r\nThe search order is as follows:\r\n1. Project Root\r\n2. Workspace Root\r\n\r\nIf no `vitest-base.config.*` file is found, the builder proceeds with its default in-memory configuration.

This option is runner-agnostic and enhances flexibility for both Vitest and Karma.\r\n\r\nThe option accepts a boolean or a string path:\r\n- `true`: Automatically searches for a default config file (`karma.conf.js` or `vitest.config.ts`). If not found, the runner will use its internal default configuration.\r\n- `false` (default): Disables the use of any external config file.\r\n- `path/to/config`: Uses the specified configuration file.\r\n\r\nFor Vitest, the loaded configuration is deep-merged with the system's programmatic config. This allows users to add or override advanced options (like `test.coverage`) while preserving the essential in-memory integration. The system's settings take precedence in case of conflicts.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the file is loaded, the Angular team does not provide direct support for its specific contents or any third-party plugins used within it.\r\n\r\nInformational messages are now logged to indicate which configuration file is being used, improving transparency.\r\n\r\nCloses #31392","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31603","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): allow custom runner configuration file for unit-test\" (#31603)"},{"Id":"3557708836","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-27T16:51:59","Actor":"alexandresebrao","Number":"31614","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS after update to 20.3.7.","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.6\n\n### Description\n\nAfter running ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material\n\nThe project entered on eternal loop.\n\nSo I thought that I needed to do some changes to my server.ts\n\nAnd created a new project to compare but when using ng new\n\nWith SSR and got this error\n\n```\nError: NG0401: Missing Platform: This may be due to using `bootstrapApplication` on the server without passing a `BootstrapContext`.

Add one more character (`a`),\n    -> A scroll bar appears even though the text area expands correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `textarea` should **never display a scrollbar** when autosizing is enabled, regardless of `line-height` precision.\n\nIt should fully expand to fit content, even when `line-height` includes decimal or sub-pixel values.\n\n<img width=\"225\" height=\"103\"

It accepts an array of data, configuration, and various business inputs. One of these inputs is a `trackBy` function, which is required since we have different data interfaces. However, there are cases when the default `trackBy` logic suffices and no function is needed. As a result, the `trackBy` input can either be a `TrackByFunction` or `null/undefined`. This presents a problem, as passing a `null/undefined` to `trackBy` in `ngFor` will result in an error.\r\n\r\nHere is the reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/optional-track-by\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt appears that Angular already handles cases where `trackBy` is not valid and null is considered a valid value, as seen in this [code snippet](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_for_of.ts#L169).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22116465/227736157-4d0e7889-d932-4d17-9ce5-906fd0469c9e.png)\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Angular assumes that `TrackByFunction` can be undefined and uses the default implementation when needed, as seen in this [code snippet](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/change_detection/differs/default_iterable_differ.ts#L55).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22116465/227735588-b4178cff-0abc-40f7-b511-f7e76a2855ce.png)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the proposed solution is to extend `TrackByFunction` to accept `null/undefined` values.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThere are two potential solutions: assigning a default value for the input or handling the case of null/undefined in the template.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49593","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow TrackByFunction be null/undefined\" (#49593)"},{"Id":"1640539460","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-25T14:32:18","Actor":"devversion","Number":"49592","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update pullapprove config to reflect current availability","State":"open","Body":"Updating PullApprove to reflect current availability.

Even in a completely fresh angular project (as generated by `ng new polyfill-test`) and the canonical browserslist (as generated by `ng generate config browserslist`), the generated main.js file contains `??` operators. The default browserslist allows for Firefox 60 (as confirmed by `npx browserslist`), which does not support `??` (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing).\r\n\r\nUsing newer functions (like `Object.fromEntries`) does also not generate the corresponding polyfills.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding (https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-browser-compatibility) transpiling down and generating polyfills should work out of the box.

issues.\r\nIn particular, I'm using `vscode-jest-runner` extension, and when I use its codeLens option to run a single test, it fails if the components involved use i18n, because it can't find `$localize`, despite the type being listed in `tsconfig.spec.json`'s `types`. \r\nWhen running test architect from cli everything works.\r\nAt the moment my workaround is to explicitly initialize `$localize` in `test-setup.ts` with the old `import '@angular/localize/init';`, hoping this will not interfere when test are launched from cli (double initialization?).\r\nIs there any other way?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- use i18n in a component\r\n- test the component outside ng-cli\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI:

However, support for it wasn't added to object type declarations (e.g. interfaces) due to an oversight. This release adds support for these cases, so the following TypeScript 5.0 code can now be built with esbuild:\n\n    ```ts\n    interface Foo { <const T>(): T }\n    type Bar = { new <const T>(): T }\n    ```\n\n-   Implement preliminary lowering for CSS nesting ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    Chrome has [implemented the new CSS nesting specification](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/) in version 112, which is currently in beta but will become stable very soon. So CSS nesting is now a part of the web platform!\n\n    This release of esbuild can now transform nested CSS syntax into non-nested CSS syntax for older browsers. The transformation relies on the `:is()` pseudo-class in many cases, so the transformation is only guaranteed to work when targeting browsers that support `:is()` (e.g. Chrome 88+). You'll need to set esbuild's [`target`](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target) to the browsers you intend to support to tell esbuild to do this transformation. You will get a warning if you use CSS nesting syntax with a `target` which includes older browsers that don't support `:is()`.\n\n    The lowering transformation looks like this:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a.btn {\n      color: #&#8203;333;\n      &:hover { color: #&#8203;444 }\n      &:active { color: #&#8203;555 }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome88) */\n    a.btn {\n      color: #&#8203;333;\n    }\n    a.btn:hover {\n      color: #&#8203;444;\n    }\n    a.btn:active {\n      color: #&#8203;555;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    More complex cases may generate the `:is()` pseudo-class:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    div, p {\n      .warning, .error {\n        padding: 20px;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome88) */\n    :is(div, p) :is(.warning, .error) {\n      padding: 20px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In addition, esbuild now has a special warning message for nested style rules that start with an identifier. This isn't allowed in CSS because the syntax would be ambiguous with the existing declaration syntax. The new warning message looks like this:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] A nested style rule cannot start with \"p\" because it looks like the start of a declaration [css-syntax-error]\n\n            <stdin>:1:7:\n              1 │ main { p { margin: auto } }\n                │        ^\n                ╵        :is(p)\n\n          To start a nested style rule with an identifier, you need to wrap the identifier in \":is(...)\" to\n          prevent the rule from being parsed as a declaration.\n\n    Keep in mind that the transformation in this release is a preliminary implementation. CSS has many features that interact in complex ways, and there may be some edge cases that don't work correctly yet.\n\n-   Minification now removes unnecessary `&` CSS nesting selectors\n\n    This release introduces the following CSS minification optimizations:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      & {\n        color: blue;\n      }\n      & :hover {\n        text-decoration: underline;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    a{font-weight:700;&{color:#&#8203;00f}& :hover{text-decoration:underline}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    a{font-weight:700;:hover{text-decoration:underline}color:#&#8203;00f}\n    ```\n\n-   Minification now removes duplicates from CSS selector lists\n\n    This release introduces the following CSS minification optimization:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    div, div { color: red }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    div,div{color:red}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    div{color:red}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.17.13`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01713)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.12...v0.17.13)\n\n-   Work around an issue with `NODE_PATH` and Go's WebAssembly internals ([#&#8203;3001](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3001))\n\n    Go's WebAssembly implementation returns `EINVAL` instead of `ENOTDIR` when using the `readdir` syscall on a file. This messes up esbuild's implementation of node's module resolution algorithm since encountering `ENOTDIR` causes esbuild to continue its search (since it's a normal condition) while other encountering other errors causes esbuild to fail with an I/O error (since it's an unexpected condition). You can encounter this issue in practice if you use node's legacy `NODE_PATH` feature to tell esbuild to resolve node modules in a custom directory that was not installed by npm. This release works around this problem by converting `EINVAL` into `ENOTDIR` for the `readdir` syscall.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with CSS `@layer` rules that have parsing errors ([#&#8203;3016](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3016))\n\n    CSS at-rules [require either a `{}` block or a semicolon at the end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-at-rule). Omitting both of these causes esbuild to treat the rule as an unknown at-rule. Previous releases of esbuild had a bug that incorrectly removed unknown at-rules without any children during minification if the at-rule token matched an at-rule that esbuild can handle. Specifically [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) can generate `@layer` rules with parsing errors, and empty `@layer` rules cannot be removed because they have side effects (`@layer` didn't exist when esbuild's CSS support was added, so esbuild wasn't written to handle this). This release changes esbuild to no longer discard `@layer` rules with parsing errors when minifying (the rule `@layer c` has a parsing error):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        @&#8203;layer c\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b;\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b.c;\n    ```\n\n-   Unterminated strings in CSS are no longer an error\n\n    The CSS specification provides [rules for handling parsing errors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/syndata.html#parsing-errors). One of those rules is that user agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line (i.e., before an unescaped line feed, carriage return or form feed character), but then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string was found. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ...would be treated the same as:\n\n    ```css\n    p { color: green; color: green; }\n    ```\n\n    ...because the second declaration (from `font-family` to the semicolon after `color: red`) is invalid and is dropped.\n\n    Previously using this CSS with esbuild failed to build due to a syntax error, even though the code can be interpreted by a browser. With this release, the code now produces a warning instead of an error, and esbuild prints the invalid CSS such that it stays invalid in the output:\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new non-minified output: */\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new minified output: */\n    p{font-family:'Courier New Times\n    color: red;color:green}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.18`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90fb6dd0c44f4e3f4d85e8e457c3669d75934a32...ad42fbb1ba09eb942ae9afc44a41bf1394c8c16f)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90fb6dd0c44f4e3f4d85e8e457c3669d75934a32...ad42fbb1ba09eb942ae9afc44a41bf1394c8c16f)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.60.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.59.3...1.60.0)\n\n-   Add support for the `pi`, `e`, `infinity`, `-infinity`, and `NaN` constants in\n    calculations.

[displayWith]=handlerFunction\">\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n`sample-slider.component.ts`\r\n```ts\r\n...\r\nexport class SampleSliderComponent {\r\n   ...\r\n   private _innerProperty: string = 'I want to show this text into the thumbnail formatting';\r\n\r\n   public handlerFunction(value: number): string {\r\n      return `${this._innerProperty} - ${value}`;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n_Originally posted by @3phase in https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26789#issuecomment-1470132741_\r\n\r\nThe one way to solve the issue is by explicitly setting the component's context when referring to the property, something like that:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n...\r\n<mat-slider [displayWith]=\"handlerFunction.bind(this)></mat-slider>\r\n```\r\nbut I think it's a hacky solution and at least has to be mentioned in the docs.\r\nI'd either try to refactor the code so that the context isn't lost by invoking the handler from the logic of the MatSlider component (and therefore switching the implementation context), or mention it into the docs so that users don't get perplexed by the weird context shift.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26810","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(MatSlider): displayWith handler losing implementation context\" (#26810)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-03-27T03:30:02.9833782Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2112}

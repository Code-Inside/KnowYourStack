This library always aims at supporting one EOLed LTS release which by this time now is 12.x which has reached EOL 30 Apr 2022.\n\n-   Remove the minified UMD build from the package.\n\n    Minified code is hard to audit and since this is a widely used library it seems more appropriate nowadays to optimize for auditability than to ship a legacy module format that, at best, serves educational purposes nowadays.\n\n    For production browser use cases, users should be using a bundler. For educational purposes, today's online sandboxes like replit.com offer convenient ways to load npm modules, so the use case for UMD through repos like UNPKG or jsDelivr has largely vanished.\n\n-   Drop IE 11 and Safari 10 support. Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.\n\n    This also removes the fallback on msCrypto instead of the crypto API.\n\n    Browser tests are run in the first supported version of each supported browser and in the latest (as of this commit) version available on Browserstack.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   optimize uuid.v1 by 1.3x uuid.v4 by 4.3x (430%) ([#&#8203;597](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/597)) ([3a033f6](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/3a033f6bab6bb3780ece6d645b902548043280bc))\n-   remove UMD build ([#&#8203;645](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/645)) ([e948a0f](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/e948a0f22bf22f4619b27bd913885e478e20fe6f)), closes [#&#8203;620](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/620)\n-   use native crypto.randomUUID when available ([#&#8203;600](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/600)) ([c9e076c](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/c9e076c852edad7e9a06baaa1d148cf4eda6c6c4))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add Jest/jsdom compatibility ([#&#8203;642](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/642)) ([16f9c46](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/16f9c469edf46f0786164cdf4dc980743984a6fd))\n-   change default export to named function ([#&#8203;545](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/545)) ([c57bc5a](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/c57bc5a9a0653273aa639cda9177ce52efabe42a))\n-   handle error when parameter is not set in v3 and v5 ([#&#8203;622](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/622)) ([fcd7388](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/fcd73881692d9fabb63872576ba28e30ff852091))\n-   run npm audit fix ([#&#8203;644](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/644)) ([04686f5](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/04686f54c5fed2cfffc1b619f4970c4bb8532353))\n-   upgrading from uuid3 broken link ([#&#8203;568](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/568)) ([1c849da](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/1c849da6e164259e72e18636726345b13a7eddd6))\n\n##### build\n\n-   drop Node.js 8.x from babel transpile target ([#&#8203;603](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/603)) ([aa11485](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/aa114858260402107ec8a1e1a825dea0a259bcb5))\n\n-   drop support for legacy browsers (IE11, Safari 10) ([#&#8203;604](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/604)) ([0f433e5](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0f433e5ec444edacd53016de67db021102f36148))\n\n-   drop node 10.x to upgrade dev dependencies ([#&#8203;653](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/653)) ([28a5712](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/28a571283f8abda6b9d85e689f95b7d3ee9e282e)), closes [#&#8203;643](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/643)\n\n##### [8.3.2](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/compare/v8.3.1...v8.3.2) (2020-12-08)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   lazy load getRandomValues ([#&#8203;537](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/537)) ([16c8f6d](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/16c8f6df2f6b09b4d6235602d6a591188320a82e)), closes [#&#8203;536](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/536)\n\n##### [8.3.1](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/compare/v8.3.0...v8.3.1) (2020-10-04)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   support expo>=39.0.0 ([#&#8203;515](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/515)) ([c65a0f3](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/c65a0f3fa73b901959d638d1e3591dfacdbed867)), closes [#&#8203;375](https://togithub.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/375)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).\r\n\r\nBefore, up to version 14.1, having a proxy configured like so:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"/api\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"http://localhost:18080\",\r\n    \"changeOrigin\": true,\r\n    \"ws\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorked fine when the browser was making an CORS preflight OPTIONS request.\r\n\r\nHere's 3 requests, first directly to the origin, second using local dev-server with Angular CL v14.1 and third using v14.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest to origin:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncurl -v 'http://localhost:18080/api/log' \\\r\n  -X 'OPTIONS' \\\r\n  -H 'access-control-request-headers: content-type' \\\r\n  -H 'access-control-request-method: POST' \\\r\n  -H 'origin: http://localhost:4200'\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Date: Mon, 05 Sep 2022 10:06:10

changed/overriden.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- Create a new app with `ng new ng-cli-cors-headers`, cd into its directory.\r\n- Create a file `proxy.conf.json` with above contents (although using a different target that also responds to OPTIONS requests with specific Access-Control-Allow-* response headers)\r\n- `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`\r\n- issue above mentioned curl requests

All network requests are functioning and pointed at the correct endpoints. When I build the app with `npm run build` which is `\"node --max_old_space_size=8000 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration production --base-href /app/ && npm run post-build\"` and serve it locally, it appears that all my network requests request url's are being replaced with the host url. For example, my login endpoint should be `https://requestapi.com/login` but every single api call has a request url as `http://localhost:4000/`. That's it, nothing append to the end of the url or anything. All the network requests work perfectly when I just do `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\npackage.json\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"appname-frontend\",\r\n  \"version\":

I could not find the reason it works when I dynamically change the contrast, as the debugger won't stop at any of my breakpoints. However when I attach a breakpoint to the `body` itself (like right click on the node and break on attribute modifications) it breaks and works like on page refresh. It stops [HERE](https://github.dev/angular/components/blob/f379e803fd8c3e4298a244f3e438ec249f94cab5/src/cdk/a11y/high-contrast-mode/high-contrast-mode-detector.ts#L111) with the breakpoint on the element, but not when I mark it.\r\n\r\n### Note 2\r\n\r\nIt is caused by Windows.

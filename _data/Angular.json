That has been fixed through a few PRs but the docs on these PRs by themselves are now incorrect and do not clarify a few things:\r\n\r\n[`SwRegistrationOptions`](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions) docs need to be updated for the `registrationStrategy` key.\r\n\r\n- The default registration strategy is now wait for app to stabilize or 30 seconds whichever comes first. It does not mention this very important second part about the 30 second timeout.\r\n- `registerWhenStable` actually supports `registerWhenStable:<timeout>`, this is how the above is implemented. See here for internally using [this](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/service-worker/src/module.ts#L104)\r\n- It should be safe to use the example [here](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-communications#checking-for-updates) due to the above default strategy change. This should be noted if you use a custom strategy that it can potentially break things.\r\n  - Previously the examples using intervals were unsafe\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to go down a rabbit hole of issues and PRs to figure out that it is actually now safe to use interval to check for updates. I am happy the actual code is fixed but it would be nice to get the docs updated to reflect this more clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13351\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34464\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/commit/29e8a64cf02fa9b80d38c30091e0b730403c54c8#diff-d3f0f5f34efd2b679fc85854b84a281a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37580","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Update service worker registration docs to reflect update interval fixes\" (#37580)"},{"Id":"638443353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-14T22:29:41","Actor":"marianazangrossi","Number":"37579","RawContent":null,"Title":"Include the injector name in error: Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding Angular module","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> This feature request is for @angular/upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn the project I'm working we are migrating AngularJS to Angular 2+ and we face this error often: `Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding Angular module.` It would be very helpful to include the injector name in the error message, it would save a lot of time instead of search each injector until finding the one which is throwing this error.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n`Trying to get the Angular injector before bootstrapping the corresponding 'Angular module.

However there is a specific situation in the upgrade package that could arguably be considered a bug.\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/core.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`NgZone.isInAngularZone()`, is a static method, which means that it can only answer if we are currently running in any Angular Zone, rather than the one for the \"current\" application.\r\n\r\nAngular has always been designed to support multiple applications running on a single page. While the CLI is not particularly conducive to this situation, that does not change this design intent. \r\n\r\nHowever, by default, each application will have its own NgZone, and underlying zone. Thus if you have two apps called App1 and App2, they will have different zones, unless you go out of your way to avoid that.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you cannot tell which one you are running in. `NgZone.isInAngularZone()` will return true regardless of which of App1 or App2's zone you are running in. Now this is not always a particularly huge deal. That API is only used twice in angular outside the tests or assertions. The first is to print a warning message if navigation is triggered \r\n\r\nHowever, if used in a pattern like this: `NgZone.isInAngularZone() ? cb() : ngZone.run(cb)`, that is a problem, since the zone we are currently running in could be the one for App2, when the callback needs to run in the zone for App1. If that code seems at all unlikely, it shouldn't, since it came from this repository. It only runs when using `downgradeModule()`, but it is still arguably buggy:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d1ea1f4c7f3358b730b0d94e65b00bc28cae279c/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component.ts#L90\r\n\r\nI expect a very similar pattern occurs from time to time in third party libraries, or even in application code. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIdeally there would be an instance method on NgZone that would return true if you are running in that specific zone.\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally the existing static methods would be deprecated, in favor of new versions named something like `IsInAnyAngularZone`, to indicate that it returns true if you are in any such zone. This would encourage existing users of this api to decide if they they are concerned with running in the zone for a specific app, or if they care about running in any angular zone. For example, some code may simply want to make sure it is running outside of any angular zone for performance or correctness reasons. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nA different possibility would be to move the zone to the platform level, and force all apps to use the same zone. That would be a big breaking change, with implications on several other apis. It also eliminates the change-detection speedup that comes from each app having their own zone.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to distinguish between different NgZones used on the same page\" (#37577)"},{"Id":"638338646","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-14T12:02:10","Actor":"h3d0","Number":"37576","RawContent":null,"Title":"Lazy-loaded module import increases the size of main.js","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\nUnable to specify which package exactly might cause the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nUnable to confirm whether this is a regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdding imports in the lazy-loaded module increases the size of the **main.js** file, although one would expect to increase the size of **the lazy-loaded chunk instead**.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n1.

This in and of itself, is not the concern. The issue is that, in this particular context, AOT and JIT behave similarly but differ without compiler warnings or errors in one particular case.\r\n\r\nIf I define a function on a route's `data` field, it will appear with JIT on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.data`. However, with AOT, it silently drops this field. No compiler error, no compiler warning. This seems to go against the precedent that has been set, wherein both AOT and JIT give compiler errors if you attempt to build with lambda expressions or non exported functions.\r\n\r\nSee example code below.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nServe commands with arguments I used.\r\n \r\n```\r\nng serve -c=debug\r\nng serve -c=debug --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Route\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'someroute',\r\n    component: SomeComponent,\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    data: {\r\n      pageTitle: 'Some | Title',\r\n      doesShowUpWithAOT: doesShowUpWithAOT,\r\n      // throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT, this behaves as expected\r\n      doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError() { // behaves inconsistently between JIT and AOT\r\n        console.log('foo');\r\n      },\r\n      // alsoThrowsCompilerErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: () => console.log('foo') this behaves as expected\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// code from within some class\r\nconstructor(private _route: ActivatedRoute, private _router: Router) {\r\n   this._router.events\r\n      .subcribe(event => {\r\n         if(event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\r\n               const data = this._route.snapshot.firstChild.data;\r\n               const functionMember = data['doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError']; // is null with AOT, properly defined with JIT\r\n         }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue, for the sake of consistency and explicitness, that both AOT and JIT should throw compiler errors, instead of the function making it through in JIT, and dropping away silently in AOT. I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Specifically, color support checking is now done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/1cd51e64c7331a9cc48d59e8fd6df74d3c6c48f3/packages/angular/cli/utilities/color.ts#L11-L14\r\n\r\nAlas, when node is run within a MINGW terminal (as installed by git for windows), `process.stdout` is a `Socket`, causing `instanceof WriteStream` to return false, and all use of colors by the angular CLI to be disabled, even though the MINGW terminal supports colors just fine ...\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Typings do not contain the function call (added in Node.js v9.9.0)\r\nexport const supportsColor =\r\n  process.stdout instanceof WriteStream\r\n  && ((process.stdout as unknown) as { getColorDepth(): number }).getColorDepth() > 1 \r\n  || process.env.MSYSTEM; // MINGW terminals support color even though nodejs mistakes them for a Socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can submit a PR to that effect.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might prefer to delegate to angular_devkit/core/src/terminal/caps.ts instead, whose vendored implementation of `supportsColor` still contains my earlier fix. However, not knowing your policy for dependencies across npm packages I don't feel comfortable submitting a PR to that effect.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17924","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"webpack output is no longer colored in git bash (again)\"

Description\r\nHey\r\n\r\nCurrently I have been using Nginx with my Angular build and its directly pointed towards Angular output path i.e. /dist folder and serving it from there itself.\r\n\r\nBut what happens is when I run `ng build --prod` on the server then it remove the old build first from the output folder and then compile the new build from the source code and till the time the process completed my Nginx throws `internal server error`.\r\n\r\nI know the option `--deleteOutputPath=false` where you can specify ng build to not delete the output path files but it just keeps on adding files which I think is not a good option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere should be an option in ng build like `--preserveOutputPath=true` where if given will not delete any content from the output path until the compilation is done and then replaces the new build files with the old build files.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAs I am using Ansible to deploy and build angular app on server I have to specify different output path while building app and then replaces that one's files with the output path (/dist) files which is an additional task needed to perform.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option in ng build to preserve build files until compilation is

After run server I only see  \r\n> 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY INIT'\r\n> ..\r\n> [HPM] Subscribed to http-proxy events:  [ 'proxyRes', 'error', 'close' ]\r\n(if I use `bypass` I don't see 'proxyRes')\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust not works - header is not included to serwer response (and on server console I DON'T see 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY RUN' so I guess onProxyRes/bypass function is never  triggered). I try many combinations of paths, and PROXY_CONFIG fields.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n> Angular CLI: 8.0.2\r\n> Node: 12.11.1\r\n> OS: linux x64\r\n> Angular: 8.0.0\r\n\r\nI run angular on MacOs High Sierra using inside [docker node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) by:\r\n\r\n`ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3002 --disable-host-check --poll 1`\r\n\r\nand outside docker in browser application works on http://my-project.local:3002\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

from being prefetch","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31256.\r\n\r\nWhen differential loading is used, by default the Angular Service Worker will double-(pre)fetch the ES5 & ES2015 bundles, unless those are explicitly excluded as per https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31256#issuecomment-506507021.\r\n\r\nExcluding those ES5 bundles from the `ngsw-config.json` template would provide a better developer experience, removing the risk of double fetching the JS bundles when differential loading is used/enabled, while having no impact when differential loading isn't used.\r\n\r\nDoing so would prevent browsers with Service Worker support but without `<script type=\"module\">` support to prefect the correct JS bundles, but I'd argue the tradeoff is acceptable (and the default `ngsw-config.json` config can just be modified) compared to current double fetching.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n- the few browser versions that support Service Workers but not `<script type=\"module\">`, which according to https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module & https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers are basically Firefox < 60 (current is 76), Chrome < 61 (current is 83), Opera < 48 (current is 68), are all outside Angular's browser support ranges (and outdated).\r\n- the Angular Service Worker has also no support to load a different (es5) `ngsw.json` config for these browsers (nor the Angular CLI has support to built it), and realistically will never need to.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR

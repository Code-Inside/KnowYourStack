\"NodeNext\"","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n# Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Problems with Module \"NodeNext\"\n\nSetting `\"module\"` to `\"NodeNext\"` in `tsconfig.json` leads to errors during HMR, when changing the template or styles of a component.\nThis repository is showcasing this behaviour by providing two npm scripts `esnext` and `nodenext`.\n\nTo understand the problem further you can checkout following explanation:\n\n## Example\n\nTS:\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `<div class='title'>{{title}}</div>`,\n  styles: '.title { font-size: xxx-large }',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'hello world'\n}\n```\n\nRunning `npm run esnext` will start the dev server with `module` set to `Esnext` and `moduleResolution` set to `bundler`.\nWhen now for example changing `font-size` to `x-large` will trigger an update, the build will be rerun,\na network request to `http://localhost:4200/@ng/component?c=src%2Fcomponent.ts%40AppComponent&t=<timestamp` will be made,\nfollowing code will be loaded and thus replaces the component with the update correctly.\n\n```mjs\nexport default function AppComponent_UpdateMetadata(AppComponent, ɵɵnamespaces) {\n    const ɵhmr0 = ɵɵnamespaces[0];\n    AppComponent.ɵfac = function AppComponent_Factory(__ngFactoryType__) {\n        return new (__ngFactoryType__ || AppComponent)();\n    }\n    ;\n    AppComponent.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/\n    ɵhmr0.ɵɵdefineComponent({\n        type: AppComponent,\n        selectors: [[\"app-root\"]],\n        decls: 2,\n        vars: 1,\n        consts: [[1, \"title\"]],\n        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n            if (rf & 1) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"div\", 0);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtext(1);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n            }\n            if (rf & 2) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵadvance();\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtextInterpolate(ctx.title);\n            }\n        },\n        styles: [\"\\n\\n.title[_ngcontent-%COMP%] {\\n  font-size: x-large;\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=component.css.map */\"]\n    });\n    (() => {\n        (typeof ngDevMode === \"undefined\" || ngDevMode) && ɵhmr0.ɵsetClassDebugInfo(AppComponent, {\n            className: \"AppComponent\",\n            filePath: \"src/component.ts\",\n            lineNumber: 8\n        });\n    })();\n}\n```\n\nRunning `npm run nodenext` instead will start the dev server with module set to `NodeNext`.\nWhen doing the same change the network request will instead deliver following code:\n\n```cjs\n\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n    value: true\n});\nexports.default = AppComponent_UpdateMetadata;\nfunction AppComponent_UpdateMetadata(AppComponent, ɵɵnamespaces) {\n    const ɵhmr0 = ɵɵnamespaces[0];\n    AppComponent.ɵfac = function AppComponent_Factory(__ngFactoryType__) {\n        return new (__ngFactoryType__ || AppComponent)();\n    };\n    AppComponent.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/\n    ɵhmr0.ɵɵdefineComponent({\n        type: AppComponent,\n        selectors: [[\"app-root\"]],\n        decls: 2,\n        vars: 1,\n        consts: [[1, \"title\"]],\n        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n            if (rf & 1) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"div\", 0);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtext(1);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n            }\n            if (rf & 2) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵadvance();\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtextInterpolate(ctx.title);\n            }\n        },\n        styles: [\"\\n\\n.title[_ngcontent-%COMP%] {\\n  font-size: x-large;\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=component.css.map */\"]\n    });\n    (() => {\n        (typeof ngDevMode === \"undefined\" || ngDevMode) && ɵhmr0.ɵsetClassDebugInfo(AppComponent, {\n            className: \"AppComponent\",\n            filePath: \"src/component.ts\",\n            lineNumber: 8\n        });\n    })();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will throw following error:\n\n```\nzone.js:2317 ReferenceError: exports is not defined\n    at component?c=src%2Fco…=1744143776918:2:23\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of

The pseudo class [:is()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) has no selectors in it and it targets `ngcontent` instead of `nghost`.\nThe `child` component it's dynamically created within the group component and indeed uses `<ng-content>`. However, there is no `ngcontent` attribute applied on the HTML elements.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c316a71f-51fb-4199-88d4-48148042fff7)\n\nThe code of the `app.component.ts` is the following:\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-app-root',\n  template: ` <ng-container #contentTpl /> `,\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\n  @ViewChild('contentTpl', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true }) content!: ViewContainerRef;\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    const projectedGroup = this.content.createComponent(ChildComponent);\n\n    this.content.createComponent(MyGroupComponent, {\n      projectableNodes: [[projectedGroup.location.nativeElement]]\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI provided a link to a repo where this can be reproduced.\n\nRun `npm ci` to install the dependencies and then `npm run start -- my-app` to start in develop and `docker compose up -d` to build it in production. If you don't have docker, then run `npm run build -- my-app` and either serve the static files in the `dist` folder with a server or inspect the `main.*.js` file and look for `border: 10px solid orange`. You will see the following `:is() > *[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{border:10px solid orange}`\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/GeorgianStan/angular-issues/tree/master/wrong-css-selectors\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n\n[package.json](https://github.com/GeorgianStan/angular-issues/blob/master/wrong-css-selectors/package.json)\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60786","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular production build has different CSS selectors than development\" (#60786)"},{"Id":"2979230827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T10:30:04","Actor":"GitBrainsStudio","Number":"60784","RawContent":null,"Title":"Data Caching Issue on Page Refresh in Angular SSR with NGINX","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n**Description of the issue:**\n\nIn an Angular SSR (Server-Side Rendering) application, there is an issue where outdated data is returned when refreshing the page. It seems that Angular might be caching the initial API data during the SSR build, and then repeatedly displaying this cached data even after page refresh. However, when navigating between routes, the data loads correctly.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. The application is running with Angular SSR, proxied through NGINX.\n2. Caching is disabled for API via headers in NGINX:\n    ```nginx\n    add_header Cache-Control 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate';\n    add_header Pragma 'no-cache';\n    expires off;\n    etag off;\n    ```\n3. When refreshing the page in the browser, old (cached) data is returned.\n4. When navigating between routes in the app, data is loaded correctly.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nOn page refresh, the data should update and display the latest version, just as it does when navigating between routes.\n\n**Current behavior:**\nUpon page refresh, data does not update and shows stale values. The issue does not occur when navigating between routes within the app.\n\n**Technical details:**\n- **NGINX** is used as a reverse proxy for both the frontend and API.\n- **Angular SSR** is used for server-side rendering.\n- The issue occurs only when refreshing the page, not when navigating within the app.\n- All caching headers are disabled on the NGINX server:\n    ```nginx\n    proxy_cache off;\n    add_header Cache-Control 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate';\n    add_header Pragma 'no-cache';\n    expires off;\n    etag off;\n    ```\n\n**Additional questions/clarifications:**\n- This issue only concerns the behavior on page refresh (not route navigation).\n- It is unclear whether the caching is occurring on the Angular SSR side or at the API level, despite the NGINX settings to disable caching.\n- It would also be helpful to investigate if browser caching could be affecting the data display.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\nIt would be helpful to understand what caching mechanisms might be causing outdated data to persist on the server-side or within Angular SSR, despite the cache control settings in NGINX.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                    19.2.8\n@angular/cli                    19.2.6\n@angular/material               19.2.8\n@angular/ssr                    19.2.6\n@schematics/angular             19.2.6\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60784","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Data Caching Issue on Page Refresh in Angular SSR with NGINX\" (#60784)"},{"Id":"2979283505","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T10:07:41","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"60785","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabled form control value appears in form value if all controls are disabled","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a form control is disabled, its value normally doesn't appear anymore in its form group value.

Each sub-feature, whether static or dynamic, requires its own instances of the providers. To ensure this, I need a distinct `<router-outlet>` for each sub-feature so that the component attached there can access its parent component's providers.\n\nProviding these providers via the route configuration is not feasible because the instances need to be tied to the lifecycle of the parent component:\n=> The providers must be destroyed along with their parent component.\n=> The providers must be re-initialized when their parent component is initialized.\n\n### Example:\n```html\n<app-feature-page>\n  <app-static-sub-feature> <!-- declared in its own @Component({ providers: [...] }) -->\n    <router-outlet name=\"staticSubFeature\" />\n  </app-static-sub-feature>\n\n  @for (item of items; track item.id) {\n    <app-dynamic-sub-feature> <!-- declared in its own @Component({ providers: [...] }) -->\n      <router-outlet name=\"dynamicSubFeature-{{ item.id }}\" />\n    </app-dynamic-sub-feature>\n  }\n</app-feature-page>\n```\n> This example is intentionally simplified to illustrate the problem. I can provide a more concrete use case if needed.\n\nThe core issue lies in the route configuration. While it's possible to have a dynamic `name` attribute in the HTML template, this doesn't work at the route configuration level:\n```ts\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  // ... other routes ...\n  { path: '...', outlet: 'dynamicSubFeature-xxx' } // <= No way to tell Angular how to retrieve a dynamically named outlet\n];\n```\n\n#### Angular doesn't provide a mechanism to define route targets for dynamically named `<router-outlet>`s in the route configuration. This prevents proper routing to `<router-outlet>`s that are created dynamically in the template.\n\n### Current Workaround and its Drawbacks:\n\nCurrently, to achieve the desired behavior of conditionally displaying components within dynamically generated sub-features while maintaining distinct provider scopes, I've implemented a workaround using `*ngComponentOutlet` and query parameters.\n\nInstead of relying on named `<router-outlet>`s and path-based routing for the sub-feature components, I dynamically render components using `*ngComponentOutlet` based on a query parameter:\n```ts\n@Component({\n    ....,\n    providers: [Foo, Bar] // <= the providers used by either/both this component or/and its sub components, etc.\n    template: `\n        ....\n        @if (displaySubFeatureSubComponent$ | async) {\n            <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"SubFeatureSubComponent\" />\n        }\n    `,\n})\nexport class SubFeature {\n    protected readonly SubFeatureSubComponenp = SubFeatureSubComponent;\n\n    readonly id = input.required<string>();\n\n    private readonly activatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);\n    protected readonly displaySubFeatureSubComponent$ = this.activatedRoute.queryParamMap().pipe(\n        map((queryParams) => queryParams.get('subfeature') === this.id()) // instead of { path: 'subfeature/:id' }\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThis approach involves:\n- Replacing `<router-outlet>` within each sub-feature with `<ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"...\">`\n- Instead of defining routes with specific paths for sub-components, the display of these components is controlled by a query parameter (e.g., `?subfeature=someId`)\n- The `displaySubFeatureSubComponent$` observable checks the query parameter against the sub-feature's ID to determine whether to render the sub-component.\n\nWhile this workaround functions as expected in terms of achieving isolated provider instances and conditional rendering, it is **unconventional and introduces several drawbacks** like the loss of standard routing semantics: It deviates from the standard Angular routing paradigm, making the application's navigation logic less intuitive and harder to understand for new developers on the project\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nTo address the limitation of targeting dynamically named `<router-outlet>`s, I propose enhancing the `Route['outlet']` configuration to support regular expressions or a dedicated pattern-matching syntax. This would enable developers to define route targets that can match outlet names based on a defined pattern.\n\nOne potential implementation involves allowing a `RegExp` object to be assigned to the outlet property in the route configuration:\n```ts\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  // ... other routes ...\n  { path: '...', outlet: /^dynamicSubFeature-\\d+$/ }\n];\n```\n\nIn the template, the dynamic outlet would be set like this:\n```html\n<a [routerLink]=\"['', { outlets: { [`dynamicSubFeature-${id}`]: [''] } }]\">...</a>\n\n<router-outlet name=\"dynamicSubFeature-{{id}}\" />\n```\n\nMy initial investigation of the Angular Router's source code suggests that this approach is technically feasible with relatively minor modifications. Specifically, the [`getOutlet` and `sortByMatchingOutlets` methods](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages%2Frouter%2Fsrc%2Futils%2Fconfig.ts#L225-L237) could be adapted to handle RegExp objects:\n```diff\nexport function getOutlet(route: Route): RegExp {\n- return route.outlet || PRIMARY_OUTLET;\n+ const outlet = route.outlet || PRIMARY_OUTLET;\n+ return typeof outlet === 'string' ? RegExp(outlet) : outlet;\n}\n\nexport function sortByMatchingOutlets(routes: Routes, outletName: string): Routes {\n- const sortedConfig = routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r) === outletName);\n+ const sortedConfig = routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r).test(outletName));\n- sortedConfig.push(...routes.filter((r) => getOutlet(r) !== outletName));\n+ sortedConfig.push(...routes.filter((r) => !getOutlet(r).test(outletName)));\n  return sortedConfig;\n}\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile using `RegExp` is my initial thought, other approaches could be considered:\n\n- Special Syntax: Introducing a specific syntax within the outlet string (similar to path wildcards or parameters) to define patterns. For example: `'dynamicSubFeature-*'`, `'dynamicSubFeature-{id}'`.\n- Dedicated identifier Key: Adding a new identifier key to the Route configuration specifically for matching dynamic outlet names. This could potentially leverage the `@for` `track` expression's logic or a similar mechanism.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60770","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow `RegExp` (or Pattern Matching) for named router outlet targets in route configuration\" (#60770)"},{"Id":"2976230932","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T09:33:12","Actor":"coder-ashwin","Number":"60768","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: Debounce in signal / httpResource","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to make a get API call whenever the user searches but with a debounce time in httpResource.\n\nI am open to contributing a PR for this, I wanted to know if this is a right thing to ask and if yes then I wanted to discuss which approach would be the best\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI could think of these 2 solutions, let me know if there's anything better: \n1. debounceTrack function similar to untracked function\n2. debounce property in the options of signal primitive\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere is a workaround to do this -> toSignal(toObservable(searchSignal()).pipe(debounceTime(500)))\n\n2 Reasons I am not doing this:\n- After signals, I was using RxJs only for 3 things, switchMap, takeUntil and debounce.

It no longer does. \n\nIf I add for instance\n```json\n\"externalDependencies\": [\n  \"class-transformer\",\n  \"class-validator\"\n],\n```\nto my angular.json, and add a console.log right before the call to `setExternalMetadata` in `@angular/build/src/builders/application/execute-build.js` like this:\n19.2.1\n```javascript\n        const { externalConfiguration, externalImports: { browser, server }, } = bundlingResult;\n        const implicitBrowser = browser ? [...browser] : [];\n        const implicitServer = server ? [...server] : [];\n        // TODO: Implement wildcard externalConfiguration filtering\n        console.log('External configuration: ', externalConfiguration);\n        // ==> ['class-transformer', 'class-validator']\n        executionResult.setExternalMetadata(externalConfiguration\n            ? implicitBrowser.filter((value) => !externalConfiguration.includes(value))\n            : implicitBrowser, externalConfiguration\n            ? implicitServer.filter((value) => !externalConfiguration.includes(value))\n            : implicitServer, externalConfiguration);\n```\n19.2.2\n```javascript\n        const exclusionsPrefixes = externalConfiguration.map((exclusion) => exclusion + '/');\n        const exclusions = new Set(externalConfiguration);\n        const explicitExternal = new Set();\n        ...\n        console.log('External configuration: ', bundlingResult.externalConfiguration, [...explicitExternal]);\n        // ==> ['class-transformer', 'class-validator'], []\n        executionResult.setExternalMetadata(implicitBrowser, implicitServer, [...explicitExternal]);\n```\nI can see that `buildingResult.externalConfiguration` contains my externalDependencies, but `[...explicitExternal]` does not. \n\nIt seems that the change tries to collect known dependencies on client or server side and checks the result agains the externalDependencies. But if the dependencies are not known ahead of time, it will ignore them in the output. This makes SSR configurations using frameworks like NestJS hard to use. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**Example repo:** \n\nhttps://github.com/OysteinAmundsen/home\n\nTry to `bun install && bun start` - it works fine. \nTry to upgrade @angular-devkit/build-angular to 19.2.2 and `bun install && bun start`.

component and root effects.\n\n**Docs**\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/6789c7ef947952551d7598fe37a3d86093b75720/adev/src/content/ecosystem/rxjs-interop/signals-interop.md?plain=1#L93\n\n**toObservable source

is as follows:\n```typescript\nexport declare function effect(effectFn: (onCleanup: EffectCleanupRegisterFn) => void, options?: CreateEffectOptions): EffectRef;\n```\n\nIn my use case, I want Angulars `router.navigate` to run inside of an effect to reflect the change of some value in the URL.\nHowever `navigate()` returns a `Promise` which does not work with the `effect()` which only allows `void`.\n\n```typescript\neffect(async () => {\n    const myParam = this.someSignal();\n\n    await _router.navigate([], {\n        queryParams: { foo: myParam },\n        queryParamsHandling: \"merge\",\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince the example is working, just merely seems to be an Issue on the declaration of the `effect()` function.\n\nMy proposal is to change the definition as follows:\n```typescript\nexport declare function effect(effectFn: (onCleanup: EffectCleanupRegisterFn) => void | Promise, options?: CreateEffectOptions): EffectRef;\n```\n\n###

However, when we need to validate that a value does NOT match a pattern, developers have to write negated regular expressions (e.g., using negative lookahead or inverse character classes).\n\nThis approach has several drawbacks:\n- Writing negated regex patterns is complex and error-prone\n- Negated patterns can be significantly less performant, especially for complex patterns\n- The intention of the code becomes less clear and harder to maintain\n- Some patterns are extremely difficult or impossible to negate correctly using regex alone\n\n\nExample of current workaround:\n```typescript\nValidators.pattern(/^(?!.*badword).+$/) // Prevents 'badword' from appearing anywhere\n```\n\n____\n\nI can submit a PR if there's interest in this feature.

To avoid this, I tried to switch over the `\"builderMode\"` to `\"application\"` to see if that might alleviate some of these errors. However, I didn't get that far, because as soon as I added that option, I got build errors in `ng test` where it wasn't able to resolve the location of SCSS files in `src/assets` (that are referred to in the stylesheets like so: `@import 'assets/scss/variables'.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have made a full reproduction at https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-c6wauz2h?file=angular.json\n\nThe key thing here is that removing `\"builderMode\" in `angular.json` and the test builds and runs. Adding it and the error occurs.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"assets/scss/variables\" [plugin angular-compiler]\n\n    angular:styles/component:css;f13b6986812740f0b03d6a6aa6a2838352a605dfe351f63e146008c4b3472985;/home/projects/stackblitz-starters-knyg36db/src/app.component.ts:2:10:\n      2 │   @import 'assets/scss/variables';\n        ╵           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  You can mark the path \"assets/scss/variables\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n  The plugin \"angular-compiler\" was triggered by this import\n\n    src/app.component.ts:2:33:\n      2 │ ...CE__0 from \"angular:jit:style:inline;CiAgQGltcG9ydCAnYXNzZXRzL3N...\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n❯ ng version\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.6\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.6\n@angular/build                  19.1.6\n@angular/cli                    19.1.6\n@schematics/angular             19.1.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29619","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't resolve SCSS files in karma with \"builderMode\": \"application\"\" (#29619)"},{"Id":"2848585275","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-13T08:47:52","Actor":"aalbericio","Number":"29616","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for sass.silenceDeprecations in @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Description\n\nI'm using @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser executor (in Nx dev tools) and I can't get rid off thousands of warnings regarding SASS deprecations.\n\nI have tried disabling them using sass.silenceDeprecations but I always get:\n\n` Data path \"/stylePreprocessorOptions\" must NOT have additional properties(sass).\nPass --verbose to see the stacktrace.`\n\nI have discussed this same issue in the Nx repository and they are pointing to file an issue here since they always mimic angular-devkit available options.\n\nhttps://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/29230#issuecomment-2539243732\n\nI think they mean this schema:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-devkit-build-angular-builds/blob/main/src/builders/browser/schema.json\n\n\nThanks\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to have support for sass.silenceDeprecations in @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI havent found any workaround yet","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29616","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for sass.silenceDeprecations in @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\" (#29616)"},{"Id":"2850312237","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-13T08:45:39","Actor":"DimaKomoff","Number":"29630","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"prerender\": false issue","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAfter building Angular 19 application with SSR and with `\"prerender\": false` parameter running the application `node dist/app_name/server/server.mjs` there is an error occurs.\n\n`Error: Angular app engine manifest is not set.

Then we translate them to Material 3 color palettes with the `var()` function of CSS. The colorpalettes will be the implemented like following:\n\n```SCSS\n:root {\n  --my-selector-0: #000000,\n  ....\n  --my-neutral-0: #000000,\n}\n\n$_palettes: (\n  primary: (\n    0: var(--my-selector-0),\n    10: var(--my-selector-10),\n    20: var(--my-selector-25),\n    25: var(--my-selector-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n  neutral: (\n    0: var(--my-neutral-0),\n    10: var(--my-neutral-10),\n    20: var(--my-neutral-25),\n    25: var(--my-neutral-20),\n    ...\n  ),\n)\n```\n\nBut the `mat.theme` mixin generates transparencies of `neutral-0` which doesn't work, because the is a function which converts the Hex-Color into RGB and then sets the transparency.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a theme with `ng generate @angular/material:theme-color`\n2.

And pretty sure if I update Material first it will complain about another peer dependency of something  that is inline for being updated.\n\nTo work around I just use `--force` for each update command, but that seems like a hack.\nIs there a right way to do this or is this just always a chicken and the egg problem?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nUpdate  and version to another

SuperClusterAlgorithm customized options from @googlemaps/markerclusterer","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nHello, I hope this is useful to someone:\nI recently started using the angular-google-maps library to draw a Google Map with about 4000 advanced markers.\nFor this I obviously needed to use the MapMarkerClusterer component, but found it nearly impossible to customize the SuperClusterAlgorithm options, since the library only allows to add a maxZoom parameter if I'm not mistaken.\n\nI tried creating a SuperClusterAlgorithm from @googlemaps/markerclusterer, but got an error that said\n```\nNG2: Type 'SuperClusterAlgorithm' is not assignable to type 'Algorithm_2'.\n  The types of 'calculate(...).clusters' are incompatible between these types.\n    Type 'import(\"C:/Users/g.sfratato/Documents/ProgettiGit/DebugAngular/DebugQ8/node_modules/@googlemaps/markerclusterer/dist/cluster\").Cluster[]' is not assignable to type 'import(\"C:/Users/g.sfratato/Documents/ProgettiGit/DebugAngular/DebugQ8/node_modules/@angular/google-maps/index\").Cluster[]'.\n      Type 'import(\"C:/Users/g.sfratato/Documents/ProgettiGit/DebugAngular/DebugQ8/node_modules/@googlemaps/markerclusterer/dist/cluster\").Cluster' is not assignable to type 'import(\"C:/Users/g.sfratato/Documents/ProgettiGit/DebugAngular/DebugQ8/node_modules/@angular/google-maps/index\").Cluster'.\n        Property '_position' is protected but type 'Cluster' is not a class derived from 'Cluster'.\n```\n\nFor this reason I tried to solve the problem by changing the source code: in the index.d.ts file, I added this import\n\n```\nimport { AbstractAlgorithm as Algorithm_2} from '@googlemaps/markerclusterer'\n```\nand commented out the Algorithm_2 interface definition.\n\nAfter this, I could use the SuperClusterAlgorithm from @googlemaps/markerclusterer with no problems.\n\nI have no idea if this is ok to do nor if it is feasable but wanted to share this with the community, thanks!\n\n### Use Case\n\nIn my use case I specifically wanted to change the radius parameter of the algorithm. After the fix, I could provide this algorithm object \n``` typescript\nalgorithm = new SuperClusterAlgorithm({\n        maxZoom: 10,\n        radius: 100\n    })\n```\n\nto the MapMarkerClusterer like this \n```html\n<map-marker-clusterer [algorithm]=\"algorithm\">\n    @for (markerPosition of markerPositions; track $index) {\n      <map-advanced-marker [position]=\"markerPosition\"/>\n    }\n  </map-marker-clusterer>\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30466","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(google-maps): Add support for SuperClusterAlgorithm customized options from @googlemaps/markerclusterer\" (#30466)"},{"Id":"2840915736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-09T19:46:19","Actor":"sericuper","Number":"30463","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): monthSelected doesn't actually update formControl if calendar view closed before picking a date in the month","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen opening a 'monthView' and closing a calendar in monthSelected event, pre-setting formControl value, its actually not changed.

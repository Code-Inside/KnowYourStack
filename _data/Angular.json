Each major version will choose a date shortly before release and pin its version support to the \"widely available\" Baseline of that date.\r\n\r\nThere's a few motivations behind this policy change:\r\n1. This gives a more explicit and well-defined browser support policy.\r\n2. This pins the support policy for each major version. Historically, \"2 most recent versions\" is vague about what date it is most recent to. Is it the release date of a particular major version, a particular patch version, the current date?\r\n3. This aligns us with the rest of the web ecosystem, which is moving towards Baseline as a mechanism for defining feature/browser support.\r\n4. This increases overall browser coverage to more accurately reflect the team's stance. It's highly unlikely we would have ever been comfortable breaking a Chrome browser only three versions old, even though that was technically allowed by the old policy.\r\n\r\nRelated PR updating Angular CLI to use this policy in its default `.browserslistrc` configuration: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30036","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60754","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: expand Angular's browser policy by adopting the \"widely available\" Baseline\" (#60754)"},{"Id":"2973371590","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T21:08:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"60753","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Patch port] fix(compiler): error if rawText isn't estimated correctly (#60529)","State":"open","Body":"**Note:** this is a patch port of #60529.\r\n\r\nThe `TemplateLiteralElementExpr` has some logic where it tries to estimate the `rawText` if one isn't provided by looking at the node's source span. The problem with this approach is that we have some long-standing issues with our expression AST parser (see https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60267#discussion_r1986402524) where it might not produce accurate spans if escape sequences are involved. This in turn can lead to unrecoverable errors, because TypeScript will throw an error if the raw string doesn't match the cooked one when constructing a TypeScript AST node.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove the logic that depends on the source span and relies purely on the secondary fallback that inserts escaped characters manually.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the `rawText` doesn't seem to matter much at this point, because the main usage of it is when downlevelling template literals to ES5 which we no longer support.\r\n\r\nFixes #60528.\r\nFixes #60751.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60753","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Patch port] fix(compiler): error if rawText isn't estimated correctly (#60529)\" (#60753)"},{"Id":"2973338373","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T20:53:05","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60752","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): replace `DOCUMENT` imports from common to core.","State":"closed","Body":"In some platforms, the previous imports could lead to `DOCUMENT` being undefined.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60752","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): replace `DOCUMENT` imports from common to core.\" (#60752)"},{"Id":"2973204809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T19:30:06","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60751","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template literals support for `@for` tracking function","State":"open","Body":"@jelbourn got bit by this on today's stream 😄\n\nIn comparison, this compiles fine \n\n    @for(item of [0, 1,2,3,4,5];

At least it was always the case with asynchronous processes that it's fine to call `fixture.whenStable()` as many times you want. \n\nThis example shows the different behavior when using resource or and async pipe on the source observable directly: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-yklwg5m5?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-yklwg5m5?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.4\nNode: 22.13.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.4\n@angular/cli                    19.2.4\n@schematics/angular             19.2.4\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60742","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"fixture.whenStable does not resolve with pending resource/rxResource\" (#60742)"},{"Id":"2971592506","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T09:29:38","Actor":"filippobrigati","Number":"60740","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update <ng-container> examples to use @if and @for syntax","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Our code is utilizing `queueMicrotask` as part of initialization. When opening an `XMLHttpRequest` within a subsequent microtask the browser CPU spikes due to recursively calling `queueMicrotask`. This only happens on Zone-enabled sites.\n\nTo reproduce, paste the following code into the console on one of the following sites: LandsEnd.com, Avery.com, PapaGinos.com:\n\n```\n(function() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  let _isDispatching = false;\n  function run() {\n    function dispatch(event) {\n      console.log(\"in dispatch for loggerString\", event);\n      if (_isDispatching) {\n        console.log(\"already dispatching, queuing string\", event);\n        queueMicrotask(() => dispatch(event));\n        console.log(\"queued string\", event);\n        return;\n      }\n      _isDispatching = true;\n      if (event === \"init\") {\n        dispatch(\"extra event\");\n        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.open(\"GET\", \"google.com\", true);\n      }\n      _isDispatching = false;\n    }\n    dispatch(\"init\");\n  }\n  run();\n})();\n```\n\nIn attempting to create as small a reproduction as possible, I used a stock CLI app and was able to recreate the issue with a larger piece of code. However, once narrowing down to this smaller example code, we weren't able to replicate in a toy app. Happy to attempt to help find out more about the incompatibility, but right now this is as far as we were able to get in terms of narrowing down the use case.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nInfinite loop/stuck in microtask queueing.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Usage of `queueMicrotask` in recursive function from outside zone task can cause infinite loop\" (#60735)"},{"Id":"2970747897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T22:09:21","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"60733","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Add r/angular link","State":"closed","Body":"The commit include some automatic reformating by prettier.

We do consider a more generic solution. Since we are getting multiple issues / feature requests around computed properties, we've opened a canonical issue #47553 to track this use-case.\n\n#47553 has since been closed too:\n> We do have computed properties with signals now!\n\nYet, I don't see any way signals can be used to solve #15041, which has since been locked for inactivity.\n\n\nHere's a practical use case, as an **example**:\n```typescript\n@Pipe({\n    name: 'sortByTranslation'\n})\nexport class SortByTranslationPipe implements PipeTransform, OnDestroy {\n    private translateSub: any = null;\n\n    constructor(private readonly translateService: TranslateService) { }\n\n    ngOnDestroy(): void {\n        if (this.translateSub !== null) this.translateSub.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    transform(input: string[]): any {\n        input.sort((a: string, b: string) => {\n            // Yes, this is heavily unoptimized, we recalculate translations on every comparison, you might want to use a dictionnary or something.\n            // It doesn't matter, though: point is, you get data from an external source, and that data might change at any time.\n            const aV = this.translateService.instant(a);\n            const bV = this.translateService.instant(b);\n\n            if (aV < bV)\n                return -1;\n            else if (aV > bV)\n                return 1;\n            else\n                return 0;\n        });\n\n        if (this.translateSub === null) {\n            this.translateSub = this.translateService.onLangChange.subscribe((value) => {\n                /* TODO: manually trigger the pipe to be refreshed here!!! */\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, we want to sort an array of translation keys alphabetically, depending on their actual translation value provided by some resource (here, a translation service).\n\nHowever, if we change of language, we'd want to recompute the result of this pipe's ``transform`` function, which we can't do as of right now:\n- ``ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`` and ``ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`` do not detect any change and therefore won't refresh the pipe\n- There's no function in the ``PipeTransform`` interface that'd allow a forced recomputation\n\nI'm using translations as an example here, but this could be applied to any callback-based data received from an external service of any kind.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEither add a function / event emitter to pipes to refresh it, or add a public function to its ``ChangeDetectorRef`` to force it to be marked as changed, even if it doesn't detect changes by itself.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis could supposedly be solved by adding ``pure: false``, but this would **NOT** be a good alternative: it would result in maaaaany unnecessary computations (or even \"too many recursion\" errors in some cases)\n\nWe don't want to recalculate data on the slightest change of anything, only when some callback we got control of is executed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60726","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Force a pipe to be recomputed from within its code\" (#60726)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2973749743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-05T02:02:20","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"30036","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update `.browserslistrc` to use Baseline","State":"open","Body":"This changes the default `.browserslistrc` file to one generated from a Baseline \"widely available\" date using `bl2bl`, codifying the policy change from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60754 into the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\nThis effectively pins the `.browserslistrc` file to a hard-coded Baseline date, preventing it from automatically updating based on `caniuse-lite` versions managed in user workspaces, which should make Angular's tooling much more stable. Prior to this, expressions like \"last 2 Chrome versions\" were relative to the installed `caniuse-lite` version and could update at any time. By pinning `.browserslistrc`, we're ensuring that supported browsers only change during Angular major version updates, not arbitrary `caniuse-lite` updates.\r\n\r\nAngular CLI now warns if users define a custom `.browserslistrc` which includes browsers beyond Angular's support policy, however we do not error or prevent it, given that Angular is pretty stable as a framework and generally does not _require_ newly released web features, so targeting older browser versions is very likely to work. However we still warn in this case because it is explicitly outside Angular's support policy and is not _guaranteed_ to work.\r\n\r\n`bl2bl` is used as a dev dependency which generates a `.browserslistrc` that is vendored in the NPM package.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\n    `Injector.get`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>angular/angular (@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\r\n\r\n### [`v20.0.0-next.5`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next5-2025-04-02)\r\n\r\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.4...20.0.0-next.5)\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n##### core\r\n\r\n-   -   Angular no longer supports Node.js v18.\r\n    -   Node.js versions 22.0 to 22.10 are also no longer supported.\r\n    Before upgrading to Angular v20, ensure the Node.js version is at least 20.11.1.\r\n    For the full list of supported versions, visit: https://angular.dev/reference/versions\r\n-   Uncaught errors in listeners which were previously only reported to\r\n    `ErrorHandler` are now also reported to Angular's internal error\r\n    handling machinery. For tests, this means that the error will be\r\n    rethrown by default rather than only logging the error. Developers\r\n    should fix these errors, catch them in the test if the test is\r\n    intentionally covering an error case, or use `rethrowApplicationErrors:\r\n    false` in `configureTestingModule` as a last resort.\r\n\r\n##### router\r\n\r\n-   The guards arrays on `Route` no longer include `any` in\r\n    the type union. The union includes functions for the functional guards\r\n    as well as a type matching `Injector.get`: `ProviderToken<T>|string`.\r\n    Note that string is still deprecated on both the route guards and\r\n    `Injector.get`.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecations\r\n\r\n##### core\r\n\r\n-   `ngIf`/`ngFor`/`ngSwitch` are deprecated. Use the control flow blocks instead (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`).\r\n\r\n#####\r\n\r\n| Commit | Type | Description |\r\n| -- | -- | -- |\r\n|

present was\n\n18.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nHi,\nsince I updated to angular 19.2.5 the `inlineCritical` CSS optimization seems to behave different, in terms that the layer order line is not longer present in the inlined CSS.\n\nWith 18.2.3 the inlined CSS looked like so:\n```html\n<style>@layer layer1,layer2;@layer layer1{*{outline-style:none;margin:0;padding:0}.layertest{background:#00f}}html,body{height:100%}html{min-height:100%}*{box-sizing:border-box}@layer layer2{@-webkit-keyframes p-fadein{0%{opacity:0}to{opacity:1}}.layertest{background:red}}.layertest{height:200px;width:200px}</style>\n```\n\nAfter upgrading to 19.2.5 it looks like so:\n```html\n<style>@layer layer1{*{outline-style:none;margin:0;padding:0}.layertest{background:#00f}}html,body{height:100%}html{min-height:100%}*{box-sizing:border-box}@layer layer2{@-webkit-keyframes p-fadein{0%{opacity:0}to{opacity:1}}.layertest{background:red}}.layertest{height:200px;width:200px}</style>\n```\n\nThis breaks the layering in cases where CSS, already **using** the layers are inlined, but the layer ordering line not. The ordering of the layer always needs to be the first @layer rule, otherwise it's ignored.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n(with @angular/cli@18.2.3 active) \n* run `ng new layertest`\n* Add a few lines of css to `src/styles.scss`:\n```css\n@layer layer1,layer2;\n\n@layer layer1 {\n  * {\n    outline-style: none;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n  }\n\n  .layertest {\n    background: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n\nhtml,\nbody {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\nhtml {\n  min-height: 100%;\n}\n\n\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n@layer layer2 {\n  @-webkit-keyframes p-fadein {\n    0% {\n      opacity: 0;\n    }\n    100% {\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  .layertest {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\n.layertest {\n  height: 200px;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n````\n\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\n* Load the page in the browser, view the HTML code served\n* Update Angular to 19.2.5 by `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\n* Load the page in the browser, view the HTML code served and recognize that the layer ordering (`@layer layer1,layer2;`) is missing\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.6\n@angular/cli                    19.2.6\n@schematics/angular             19.2.6\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30031","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"inlineCritical CSS breaks CSS layer order\" (#30031)"},{"Id":"2972748426","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T15:34:10","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30030","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): use `generateFromFiles` helper in even more cases","State":"open","Body":"The enum, interceptor, and resolver schematics now more fully use the `generateFromFiles` helper.

The error is thrown from invalidTypeError in test_bed_compiler.ts.  As far as I could tell, the getAnnotation function in the resolver was returning null instead of Component, causing the error to be tripped.  I assume the AOT build is stripping this metadata/the decorator before this check is made.  I couldn't find any way to work around the issue other than rearchitecting my component so that I was no longer needing to make the  overrideComponent call.  As long as overrideComponent was in the stack at all, regardless of what parameters I passed to it, the tests failed due to missing metadata.\n\nI have not tested any of the other types of overrides, but given that most of the code in the TestBed compiler is in common between the decorated types, I would assume they all are impacted in AOT mode.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple valid component, turn on AOT for Karma, and make a test where you use TestBed.overrideComponent to reset metadata.  You don't even need to specify an actual override in the second parameter to trigger the issue: TestBed.overrideComponent(YourComponent, {}) triggers the failure.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n_<class name> class doesn't have @Component decorator or is missing metadata.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30017","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"New AOT option for Karma doesn't play nicely with TestBed.overrideComponent\" (#30017)"},{"Id":"2969860042","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T18:34:52","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30021","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): include component test metadata in development builds","State":"closed","Body":"To support the usage of AOT with unit tests, development builds of applications will now include injected calls to the internal Angular `setClassMetadata` function.

Looking into the output of \"ng test\" with code coverage enabled, I found that the number of statements and lines touched roughly doubled compared to when I run the same tests with AOT turned off.  By looking at the files generated by karma-coverage, I found that in AOT mode the component HTML files are also being instrumented for code coverage now.  I assume this is because AOT mode compiles the templates into the Javascript for test execution.\n\nWas this intentional?  If it was, at the very least it probably should have been mentioned in the release notes.  I can't find any way to configure the codeCoverageExclude options to omit the component HTML files.  I would imagine nearly every app will see a drop in their code coverage as a result of this difference, especially given that most of the IDE tooling around code coverage doesn't even consider the possibility that HTML files would be included.  It's also not obvious at all how to cover the HTML; I have files that are listed as fully covered with basically no difference in the tests compared to ones that aren't marked as covered at all.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a simple component with a simple test and run Karma with code coverage enabled both with AOT enabled and AOT disabled.  With AOT enabled, the component HTML will be instrumented in addition to the Typescript.  With AOT disabled, only the Typescript is instrumented.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.6\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.2.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.6 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.6\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                      19.2.6\n@angular/material                 19.2.8\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.8\n@schematics/angular               19.2.6\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.8.2\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New AOT options for Karma also run code coverage on component HTML files\" (#30016)"},{"Id":"2967430008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T21:04:00","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30014","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30014","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30014)"},{"Id":"2967480906","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T20:50:16","Actor":"pawel-twardziak","Number":"30015","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Linter] Add support for Biome","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Description\n\nI am guessing it is the right time for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to be supported by Angular workspace - what do you think guys?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement the support as an alternative for eslint/prettier\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nDo not implement it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30015","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Linter] Add support for Biome\" (#30015)"},{"Id":"2967181454","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T18:20:52","Actor":"wcwcaseman","Number":"30013","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please add a flag to suppress the warning, Add only entry points to the 'files' or 'include' properties in your tsconfig.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn my NX Angular project I add entry points in webpack.

Configure `<mat-table>` tag with `cdkDropList cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\"` attribute\n2. Configure columns `<mat-header-cell>` tag with `cdkDrag` attribute\n3. Make some time for loading dataSource and update columns order by [`moveItemInArray`](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/api#functions) function\n4. You should see an error in provided code of mat-table\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected that mat-table should work normally with undefined dataSource. If source is empty, no rows exists, it's simple. Why I need to write some workaround like `<mat-table [dataSource]=\"dataSource || []\"`? It's one of weakness of mat-table. And I think while data didn't load, it shouldn't start to render rows.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`mat-table` tries to render undefined rows, so error happened. After this error mat-table work in unexpected way. For example becomes something wrong with fixed columns. They became hidden one by one.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.1.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.1.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 134.0.6998.178 (Official Build) (64-bit)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\n\n- \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.1.0\",\n- \"@angular/common\": \"^19.1.1\",\n- \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.1.1\",\n- \"@angular/core\": \"^19.1.1\",\n- \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.1.1\",\n- \"@angular/material\": \"^19.1.0\",\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30795","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Material Table tries to render rows on reorder when rows are not exists\" (#30795)"},{"Id":"2971426366","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T06:43:50","Actor":"lvjoebro","Number":"30794","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(matTooltip): Tooltip doesnt work when page is launched in mobile mode","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTooltips don't work if the page is opened in mobile mode.\n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.

Create a checkbox\n2. Bind `checked` to an `isChecked` property\n3. Listen for `change` events\n4. In event handler set `isChecked` to true\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYou should not be able to deselect the checkbox\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe checkbox appears deselected\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CHECKBOX): `checked` status not properly reflected when updated through binding from within `change` event\" (#30781)"},{"Id":"2967237418","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-02T18:36:51","Actor":"rgylesbedford","Number":"30780","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/core): Theme configuration checks should allow extra slots in color palettes","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) generates slots 5 and 15 in the color palettes. \n\n<img width=\"730\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c28a87b-dd3e-4785-b435-dca1d214f4b0\" />\n\nThese should be allowed to be included in the color palettes even if they are not used by Angular Material.\n\nHowever when I try to include those slots in a theme for Angular Material, the sass complier errors with \"Expected $config.primary to be a valid M3 palette\".

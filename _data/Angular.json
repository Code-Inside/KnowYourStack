This introduces friction when upgrading the TypeScript version\r\nwithin the workspace, as changes to TypeScript's emit format may affect\r\nngcc's ability to process it correctly.\r\n\r\nThe on demand creation of JavaScript files was convenient for authoring\r\ntests, but it also helped to detect incompatibilities with newer\r\nversions of TypeScript. Now that ngcc no longer has to process newer\r\nversions of TypeScript, we want to pin the integration suite to use\r\nJavaScript code as if it were compiled using TypeScript 4.3, i.e. a\r\nversion of TypeScript that is actually supported by ngcc.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the integration test to inline all the generated\r\nfiles directly in the tests, instead of compiling them on demand. This\r\nwas done by temporarily installing TypeScript 4.3 and using it to create\r\nthe `loadTestFiles` statement from the original TypeScript inputs.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could have been to install TypeScript 4.3 as an actual\r\ndependency in the workspace and using that to continue compiling the\r\nintegration suite on demand, but this brings some overhead in package\r\ninstallations (TypeScript is ~60MB) and the authoring aspect of ngcc\r\nintegration test is expected to diminish, now that ngcc's support is no\r\nlonger a moving target.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44448","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(ngcc): don't use the workspace typescript version to generate in…\" (#44448)"},{"Id":"1077642946","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-11T20:36:16","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"44447","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): enable narrowing of using type guard methods","State":"open","Body":"The changes in 2028c3933f7fe2961999da475febde5a03bb694d caused method\r\ncalls to be emitted using additional parenthesis into the TCB, which in\r\nturn prevented proper type narrowing when the method acts as a type\r\nguard.

I believe its related to service worker because:\r\n\r\n 1. On localhost (ng serve) I do not have these issues.\r\n 2. If I chose to **Bypass for network** in the DevTools>Application panel in production, the issue also disappears\r\n\r\nWhen videos are loading their source via service worker, they will result in source not found error and the entire media player will fail to work.\r\n\r\nMy video component is extremely simple\r\n```html\r\n<video preload=\"metadata\"\r\n       [poster]=\"poster\"\r\n       muted\r\n       controls\r\n       #videoElement\r\n>\r\n  <source #sourceElement (error)=\"onSourceError($event)\" [src]=\"src\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n</video>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event from onSourceError callback does not provide much valuable information about the problem.\r\n\r\nMy ngsw-config.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"./node_modules/@angular/service-worker/config/schema.json\",\r\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\r\n  \"assetGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"app\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/favicon.ico\",\r\n          \"/index.html\",\r\n          \"/manifest.webmanifest\",\r\n          \"/*.css\",\r\n          \"/*.js\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"assets\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"lazy\",\r\n      \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/assets/**\",\r\n          \"/*.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2|ani|mp4)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"dataGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"firebase-storage\",\r\n      \"urls\": [\r\n        \"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/**\",\r\n        \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/**\",\r\n        \"https://fonts.gstatic.com/**\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"cacheConfig\": {\r\n        \"maxSize\": 1000,\r\n        \"maxAge\": \"15d\",\r\n        \"strategy\": \"freshness\",\r\n        \"timeout\": \"0s\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n1. Go to my site: https://tekken.guru (select bunch of different characters)\r\n2. Stick around long enough for service worker to do its magic\r\n3.

The old API will continue to be supported\nuntil Dart Sass 2.0.0, but it is now considered deprecated and should be avoided\nfor new code.\n\nThe new API includes:\n\n-   `compile()` and `compileAsync()` functions that take Sass file paths and\n    return the result of compiling them to CSS. The async function returns a\n    `Promise` rather than using a callback-based API.\n\n-   `compileString()` and `compileStringAsync()` functions that take a string of\n    Sass source and compiles it to CSS. As above, the async function returns a\n    `Promise`.\n\n-   A new importer API that more closely matches the Sass specification's logic\n    for resolving loads. This makes it much easier for Sass to cache information\n    across `@import` and `@use` rules, which substantially improves performance\n    for applications that rely heavily on repeated `@import`s.\n\n-   A new custom function API, including much more usable JS representations of\n    Sass value types complete with type-assertion functions, easy map and list\n    lookups, and compatibility with the [`immutable`][immutable] package. **Unlike in the\n    legacy API,** function callbacks now take one argument which contains an array\n    of Sass values (rather than taking a separate JS argument for each Sass\n    argument).\n\n[`immutable`]: https://immutable-js.com/\n\nFor full documentation of this API, please see [the Sass website][js-api].\n\n[js-api]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api\n\nThis release also adds TypeScript type definitions.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.1`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.3.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1)\n\n##### [5.3.1](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1) (2021-12-11)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   conflict core-js dependency ([#&#8203;2754](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/2754)) ([29d4551](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/29d4551e5bfc066a5ff7109786a73ec8e782a65f)) [@&#8203;juanpicado](https://togithub.com/juanpicado)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Specifically, the error and callstack I am getting looks like this on a dev build:\r\n![Callstack error chromecast require](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5759474/145563153-4230faa5-870c-4f30-909e-b1c65a33deef.png)\r\n\r\nI have created a reduced test example, uploaded on [stackblitz, here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-videojs-chromecast?file=package.json). The critical code may be found in the `vjs-player.component.ts` file, I have added some comments to make it as obvious as possible. Sadly, it is impossible to install @silvermine/videojs-chromecast on stackblitz for some reason, as it does not recognize the package as shown below:\r\n![installing videojs-chromecast on stackblitz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5759474/145564856-d0ea67cf-4b04-4958-b06f-e8c09169d15b.png)\r\n(if you try it, you will receive errors)\r\n\r\nTherefore, to truly reproduce the error, one has to build the project locally and then install the plugin using `npm install @silvermine/videojs-chromecast --save-dev`. Once that is done, remove the comments from the code rows as described in `vjs-player.component.ts`.\r\n\r\nI have looked at the [changes in Angular 13](https://angular.io/guide/update-to-latest-version) to try and find if anything breaks. So far, I have been unable to see anything that should be problematic for this plugin. The chromecast plugin is the only plugin I build using `require`, I have tried via various `import` methods, but get the same error.\r\n\r\nI have been looking around all sorts of other issue threads today mentioning webpack and I have yet to find something that replicates my problem exactly. \r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-videojs-chromecast?file=src/app/vjs-player/vjs-player.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nSee description.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.0\r\nNode: 14.15.4\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.10\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI had the same error with 13.0.3 / 13.0.4 yesterday (with typescript version 4.4.2), but tried with 13.1.0 today (and typescript 4.5.2), but the problem persists.

Perhaps, I am missing a step.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, cloned empty project and tested the generation of new Angular workspace.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir ngx-authp-service\r\ncd ngx-authp-service\r\nng new ngx-authp-service --create-application=false --commit=false --routing=false --style=scss --directory=./ --dry-run\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dry run has the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE README.md (1061 bytes)\r\nCREATE .editorconfig (274 bytes)\r\nCREATE .gitignore (620 bytes)\r\nCREATE angular.json (139 bytes)\r\nCREATE package.json (1033 bytes)\r\nCREATE tsconfig.json (863 bytes)\r\nCREATE .vscode/extensions.json (130 bytes)\r\nCREATE .vscode/launch.json (474 bytes)\r\nCREATE .vscode/tasks.json (938 bytes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, created the workspace:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng new ngx-authp-service --create-application=false --commit=false --routing=false --style=scss --directory=./ --skip-install=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe state of the repo prior to trying to generate the service: https://github.com/greenpau/ngx-authp-service/commit/911cd3a4a1fe1c1106256768329f161474f54410\r\n\r\nAfter that, attempted to create `ngx-authp-service` service:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nng generate service ngx-authp-service\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng generate service ngx-authp-service\r\nProject \"undefined\" does not exist.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.0\r\nNode: 14.17.6\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: <error>\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1301.0 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         13.1.0 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   13.1.0 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cli                 13.1.0 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          13.1.0 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                         6.6.7 (cli-only)\r\ntypescript                   4.4.3 (cli-only)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22332","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng generate service: Project \"undefined\" does not exist.\" (#22332)"},{"Id":"1076138204","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-09T22:38:48","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"22330","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v13.2.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22330","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v13.2.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#22330)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1077716366","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-12T04:44:32","Actor":"sueszli","Number":"24090","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(dark-mode-guide): Documentation incomplete since version 11.2.12","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph from the \"Theming guide\" is missing since Version 11.2.12 of the documentation (regarding the usage of prebuilt dark themes from angular material):\r\n\r\n\"Finally, if your app's content is not placed inside a mat-sidenav-container element, you need to add the mat-app-background class to your wrapper element (for example the body).

E.g. <pre>{{(true && true) ? '&amp;ndash;' : '&amp;eacute;'}}</pre> results in the string \"&amp;ndash;\" being displayed.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, it appears that all characters from any ampersand to the subsequent semicolon are interpreted as if they are an entity regardless of placement, as can be seen in the reproduction:\r\n<pre>\r\n{{(true && true) ? '&amp;ndash;' : '&amp;eacute;'}} -> renders the string \"&amp;ndash;\"\r\n{{(true && ';') ? '&amp;ndash;' : '&amp;eacute;'}} -> renders &ndash; (an en dash)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nExamples in the reproduction follow:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109766913/180320422-9c1a69c8-832c-46d2-90b6-ea8c1a2a330a.png)\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded from Angular 11 to 14 following the instructions.

When _not_ using the `RouterModule`,\r\ninjecting the `LocationStrategy` will result in the\r\n`PathLocationStrategy` being provided with a default value used in place\r\nof `APP_BASE_HREF` that is `document?.location?.origin ?? ''`.\r\n\r\nIt can be quite surprising and annoying that once you add `RouterModule`\r\nto the application, suddenly the `APP_BASE_HREF` must be specifically\r\nprovide something new when it could use a sensible default instead.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior (before this commit) is as follows:\r\n\r\n* When `RouterModule` is not provided (or the dev doesn't specifically provide\r\n  `PathLocationStrategy`): use `DOCUMENT.location?.origin ??

Things such as [`DatePipe`](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe), [`CurrencyPipe`](https://angular.io/api/common/CurrencyPipe), and [`TitleCasePipe`](https://angular.io/api/common/TitleCasePipe) defines common problems that has already been solved in `@angular/common`. Most of them are not difficult to re-implement to use in a service, or in the class of a component, but if the code is already there in `@angular/common`, should I not be able to use it in services too? [`AsyncPipe`](https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe), and any other pipe that is not `pure` would obviously be problematic and not make sense as injectable.\r\n\r\nIn components this can be worked around by adding the Pipe to `providers: []` in the module or the standalone declaration. However this becomes awkward with services where you need to add the pipe as `providers: []` in a Module and then provide the service in that module, which is contrary to the fact that `providedIn: 'root'` is the go-to and recommended way to provide injectables in modern Angular.\r\n\r\nIt's also related that own defined Pipes could also be useful as injectables, but in those cases it's not too difficult to do\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\n@Pipe({ name: 'mypipe', standalone: true })\r\nexport class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMake pipes that are `standalone: true` also injectable. This makes it easy to make utilities that can be used in templates _and_ typescript.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nMake all `CommonModule` pipes `@Injectable()` in addition to their `@Pipe({ standalone: true })`. This ensures all the `CommonModule` pipes are injectable, and if you want your own pipes to be injectable, you can do the same with your own pipes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46920","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"(pure) pipes as injectables\" (#46920)"},{"Id":"1311642118","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-21T10:25:42","Actor":"devversion","Number":"46911","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: cut `zone.js` v0.11.7","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps the version for the upcoming `0.11.7` zone.js version,\r\nincluding the changelog.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46911","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: cut `zone.js` v0.11.7\" (#46911)"},{"Id":"1311230421","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-21T08:27:55","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"46903","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): improve the missing control flow directive message","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In particular, API docs warn about methods that could be used in an insecure manner. (Big thank you to the community!)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `Renderer2` API docs do not say much about security. In particular, nothing regarding XSS. However, the [ElementRef](https://angular.io/api/core/ElementRef#properties) API docs state the following:\r\n\r\n> Alternatively you can take a look at [Renderer2](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2) which provides API that can safely be used even when direct access to native elements is not supported.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be helpful to mention this in the Renderer2 API docs? So that potential users know what to expect...\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\n1. Read `Renderer2` API docs\r\n2. Read `ElementRef` API docs \n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\nI would _expect_ the the `Renderer2` API docs to document security implications. Specifically regarding XSS. `ElementRef` docs say that `Renderer2` \"provides API that can safely be used\".\r\nIf this is true (and superficial testing seems to support it) I'd _expect_ that the `Renderer2` API docs mention it explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf there are any exceptions to this general rule, I'd _expect_ the `Renderer2` API docs would show a clear \"USE WITH CAUTION\" security warning. E.g. if the following method calls lead to XSS, I'd _expect_ a warning in the API docs:\r\n```\r\nrenderer2.setAttribute(a, 'href', 'javascript:alert(1)');\r\nrenderer2.setAttribute(svg, 'onload', 'alert(1)');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the claims that `ElementRef` docs make about `Renderer2` are inaccurate or misleading, I'd _expect_ them to be adjusted or removed.\r\n\r\nThe _actual_ situation is that `Renderer2` API docs do not tell me anything about security. And I feel a little lost.\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\nShould be trivial to reproduce without screenshots, but I can provide some on demand...\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNone.\n```\n\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue? If so, please specify the device, browser, and version.\n\n```true\nNot browser-specific imho.\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46904","RelatedDescription":"Open issue

As part of the 14.0 update, these individual component-level files were removed.  Instead, the top level `package.json` exposes path resolutions for each version of each component via a series of `exports` entries.  As a result, any consumer that does not understand or respect the `exports` field in the top level `package.json` becomes incompatible with this library.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nClone [this repro](https://github.com/thw0rted/issue-examples/tree/angular-webpack-material) and execute `npm run start`.  The build should be successful.\r\n\r\nClone [the same thing updated to v14](https://github.com/thw0rted/issue-examples/tree/angular-webpack-material-v14) of Angular and Material, and run the same command.  You will see:\r\n\r\n> ERROR in ./src/app/app.module.ts 29:17-52\r\n> Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n> resolve '@angular/material/button' in 'path\\to\\src\\app'\r\n\r\nNote that the Webpack config uses `resolve.exportsFields: []` to ignore the `exports` field.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that do not understand the `exports` field should still be able to use the library.\r\n\r\n(If the files are not restored, and `exports`-field support is required going forward, this is a breaking change and should be documented as such in the change log, dating back to 14.0.0.)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nConsumers that don't understand, or intentionally ignore, the `exports` field can no longer use the library.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the `exports` field is the recommended solution suggested by Webpack, when using a library that fails to explicitly export a resource you need to consume.  I am stuck with such a library, I've had an open issue with them to fix it for over a year and I'm not happy about it, but there is literally nothing else I can do.  Still, this is the first time I've run into a library that does not work at all when the `exports` field is ignored / unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.0.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.5\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Win10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(package): Unannounced breaking change: new package structure requires `exports` field support\" (#25305)"},{"Id":"1309192766","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T14:10:04","Actor":"alkavats1","Number":"25304","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet ","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25304","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove empty harness e2e stylesheet \" (#25304)"},{"Id":"1309099809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T10:17:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25301","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events","State":"closed","Body":"Adds checks to ensure that `touchmove` and `touchend` events are cancelable before we call `preventDefault` on them.\r\n\r\nFixes #25272.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25301","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slider): add cancelable checks to touchmove and touchend events\" (#25301)"},{"Id":"1309148659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T08:25:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25303","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots","State":"closed","Body":"The snapshots were failing, because the MDC migration tests were targeting es2016, but the CLI introduced some es2020 syntax.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25303","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix build error in mdc migration against snapshots\" (#25303)"},{"Id":"1309106031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-19T07:47:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25302","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/snack-bar): fix out-of-sync code","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes some code that is out of sync with the code we have internally.

This finally causes the performance issue in browsers like IE11.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nUser can set mdTooltipShowDelay and avoid this issue to some extend but the ideal solution would be look for scroll event and once user stop scrolling, attach tooltip to DOM\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a grid using ngFor or material grid\r\n2. place md-tooltip in a grid cell\r\n3. make sure the grid has many records e.g. 500 (we cannot assume all users using virtual scrolling or paging)\r\n4. open the application in IE-11 and keep the mouse on the grid cell where the md-tooltip is applied\r\n5. do scrolling quickly\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo Performance issue or browser freezing\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIE11 freezes while scrolling quickly\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(md-tooltip): Performance issue when ViewChild contains many instances of md-tooltip on a scrolling panel\" (#25294)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-07-22T03:30:03.1364022Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1868}

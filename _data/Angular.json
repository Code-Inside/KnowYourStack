However, the suggested workaround no longer works (I'm not sure if it did at the time). Since the original issue has been closed and conversation has been locked, opening a new issue seemed to be the only way to address it.\r\n\r\n**The short version**\r\n\r\nHierarchical providers do not work when using Angular elements.\r\n\r\n**The long version**\r\n\r\nWhen using Angular elements, hierarchical providers do not work. The child element will always only have itself and the root as its providers. The suggested workaround is the [following comment](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24824#issuecomment-404399564):\r\n\r\n> you could implement a custom strategy (see: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/elements/src/element-strategy.ts#L27-L44) -that walked up the DOM to grab the parent element/injector before constructing the child component, but in general you should avoid depending on hierarchical DI for Elements.\r\n\r\nHowever, this workaround does not seem to work. I've implemented the workaround, fetching the parent injector at runtime and passing it as the parent injector for the newly created element instance's injector. The end result is the `NgElementStrategyFactory` being created with an injector that has the DOM parent as the injector parent (as it should). This injector is then passed to `NgElementStrategyFactory.create`, after which a new injector function is created. This is then finally passed to the `lView` creator function.\r\n\r\nThe problem that occurs at runtime however, is that the function that actually fetches dependencies does not go up this tree. This function ([getOrCreateInjectable](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2b74a05a6539b78ed6682e29d4c3b5a6052a9cdd/packages/core/src/render3/di.ts#L411)) instead searches the current injector by using the bloom system. Since the dependency has never been registered as a provided value by the given component, it is not registered on the bloom system. This function then skips this level and tries to go up to the parent. Importantly however, it does not go up this tree by using `injector.parent`, but instead looks up the parent in the `lView`. However, because the component was created as a root component with no parent ([through `ComponentFactory.create`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7ea5161d4d0570150b0315adeac44e27387f48ea/packages/core/src/render3/component_ref.ts#L98)), this fails. The `lView` has no parent, which means the check for dependency injection stops at this level and the search for the DI value fails.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there is another workaround for this issue. I tried creating a new `ComponentFactory`, by creating a new `ComponentFactoryResolver`, by creating a new `NgElementStrategyFactory`, however this fails as well. I wanted to override the `ComponentFactory.create` method but there are just too many private methods to be able to re-create the original function (and making some modifications afterwards of course). If there were a few values that I'd have to copy that would be fine, but some functions are simply not accessible and can not be copied (I'm mostly talking about `lView` context etc here).\r\n\r\nI'd be fine with the answer being:\r\n> This is works as intended (or more accurately, this is not possible with Elements)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd say if something is supported in the normal Angular version, it should at least have a workaround that makes it possible in Angular Elements. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, I'm also wondering what the reasoning behind this is:\r\n\r\n> but in general you should avoid depending on hierarchical DI for Elements\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's valid reasoning behind it but I couldn't find an explanation anywhere.\r\n\r\n**Possible fix**\r\n\r\nIn the best case of course, this would be made possible in Angular Elements out-of-the-box. However, taking into account that this is not supported on purpose, I think the following would be more realistic.\r\n\r\nAllowing the `ComponentFactory.create` function to have an optional `parent` parameter, which is then set as the parent of the `lView` would be the biggest requirement for this workaround to be possible. Of course there would have to be a few other changes in that function, where it is assumed that this is a root component. A custom element strategy can then be used (as suggested in the original issue's reply), which would allow the hierarchical dependency injection to work again.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-3jpm5a?file=src/app/app.module.ts)\r\n[github repo](https://github.com/SanderRonde/angular-elements-bug)\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(AppModule)[InjectorService -> InjectorService -> InjectorService]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectorService!\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\nNode: 14.15.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, core, elements, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular/compiler-cli             9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular/language-service         7.0.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.7\r\nrxjs                              6.6.2\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.19.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNote that this bug also occurs on the latest version (11.0.4 as of now)\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNope, this error occurs regardless of environment.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40104","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular elements can't inherit hierarchical dependencies\" (#40104)"},{"Id":"766694385","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T16:30:18","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"40107","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): ensure sanitizer works if DOMParser return null body","State":"open","Body":"In some browsers, notably a mobile version of webkit on iPad, the\r\nresult of calling `DOMParser.parseFromString()` returns a document\r\nwhose `body` property is null until the next tick of the browser.\r\nSince this is of no use to us for sanitization, we now fall back to the\r\n\"inert document\" strategy for this case.\r\n\r\nFixes #39834","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40107","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): ensure sanitizer works if DOMParser return null body\" (#40107)"},{"Id":"766307610","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T11:13:31","Actor":"magnusbakken","Number":"40105","RawContent":null,"Title":"onDestroy on ComponentRef isn't called in production mode","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/core version 11.0.4.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nThis behavior is new in 11.0.4.

Instead I made a sample repo using `ng new`, with only the @angular/cdk package added to the standard modules.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/magnusbakken/angular-ondestroy-problem\r\n2. Run `ng serve --configuration production` (I've tested that it also happens when hosting the output of `ng build` statically on a web server, but again only with `--configuration production`.)\r\n3. Click the Open button.\r\n4. Click the Close button that appears and note that nothing is logged to the console.\r\n\r\nIf run with regular `ng serve` in dev mode the line is logged to the console as expected. It's also logged if everything is kept the same but @angular/core is downgraded to 11.0.3.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell it's the `\"production\": true` setting in angular.json that causes the problem. If I change that value to false and build in production mode the callback gets called.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 11.0.4\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.4\r\n@angular/cdk                    11.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.4\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.4\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40105","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"onDestroy on ComponentRef isn't called in production mode\" (#40105)"},{"Id":"766155446","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T08:57:13","Actor":"vinitsingh64","Number":"40103","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular http client not working with translation on in IOS chrome browser","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI have angular project built in angular 10.

You can see this stackblitz app created by me - https://angular-9-starter-gf561h.stackblitz.io/\r\n\r\n![translate-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67366916/102060311-06411d80-3e18-11eb-9fb1-b4348a5d90e9.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see in stackblitz this `trnaslate` option in dislabled. but it is enabled in my local app. And once i click on that button than httpClient stops working\r\n\r\nTo Regenerate issue\r\n1) Install latest angular app\r\n2) add any httpClient service in app\r\n3) run app and open in. Iphone chrome\r\n4) Api call will stop working after clicking on translate button in IOS chrome. \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n10.0.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

After it, I realized that the method `buildDefaultPath` was removed from `@schematics/angular/utility/project`, and I should use the new one from `@schematics/angular/utility/workspace`. But when I'm running tests to test my custom schematics it fails with error.\r\n\r\nPart of custom schematics code:\r\n```\r\nreturn (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    const workspaceConfigBuffer = tree.read('angular.json');\r\n    if (!workspaceConfigBuffer) {\r\n        throw new SchematicsException(\"Not an Angular CLI workspace\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const workspaceConfig = JSON.parse(workspaceConfigBuffer.toString());\r\n    const projectName = _options.project || workspaceConfig.defaultProject;\r\n      console.log(workspaceConfig);\r\n      const project = workspaceConfig.projects[projectName];\r\n\r\n    if (!_options.path) {\r\n        _options.path = buildDefaultPath(project); // Here method throw exception\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // some code below\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is how I'm creating workspace and application in tests:\r\n```\r\nconst coreOptions: {schema: StoreSchema, workspace: WorkspaceSchema, app: ApplicationSchema} = {\r\n  workspace: {\r\n    name: 'workspace',\r\n    newProjectRoot: 'projects',\r\n    version: '11.0.4'\r\n  },\r\n  app: {\r\n    name: 'th-schematics'\r\n  },\r\n  schema: {\r\n    name: 'Admin'\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(async () => {\r\n    appTree = await schematicRunner.runExternalSchematicAsync(\r\n        '@schematics/angular',\r\n        'workspace',\r\n        coreOptions.workspace\r\n    ).toPromise();\r\n    appTree = await schematicRunner.runExternalSchematicAsync(\r\n        '@schematics/angular',\r\n        'application',\r\n        coreOptions.app,\r\n        appTree\r\n    ).toPromise()\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I see from code, this method has next line of code `const projectDirName = project.extensions['projectType'] === workspace_models_1.ProjectType.Application ? 'app' : 'lib';` But `extensions` property doesn't exist in `project`. However `projectType` exists in `project` directly\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  '$schema': './node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json',\r\n  version: 1,\r\n  newProjectRoot: 'projects',\r\n  projects: {\r\n    'th-schematics': {\r\n      projectType: 'application',\r\n      schematics: [Object],\r\n      root: 'projects/th-schematics',\r\n      sourceRoot: 'projects/th-schematics/src',\r\n      prefix: 'app',\r\n      architect: [Object]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  defaultProject: 'th-schematics'\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it's very strange that square brackets were used for `projectType` property.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n1.

Make viewport height a floating point number with decimal portion between .0 to .5.\r\n4. The overlay will now overflow out of the viewport bounds.\r\n5.

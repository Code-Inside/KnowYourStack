Instead of inline style content that is then added to a `style` element for each host node, a `link` element with a stylesheet `rel` attribute and a `href` attribute can now be created. The development server must be configured to provide the relevant component stylesheet upon request.

Since the primary use of this capability is development mode and will not be used for production code, server (SSR) style reuse is currently not yet implemented but may be implemented in the future.\r\n\r\nA component feature is used to provide the DOM renderer access to any external styles that were emitted at compile time.

However, because my system clock is in \"America/Denver\" time zone, it always skips the time forward to `\"03:00:00\"`.\r\n\r\nI should be able to display a date with an offset, without my system time zone affecting the calculation.\r\n\r\nSee the linked StackBlitz for examples of date strings that should be formatted correctly but are being affected by Daylight Saving Time calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-dtm85s\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nA date string of `\"2024-03-10T02:00:00.000\"` is being displayed as `\"2024-03-10T03:00:00.000\"`, even if I specify an offset of `\"-07:00\"` (or whatever the offset is on the system clock where this is being reproduced).\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.3\r\nNode: 22.6.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout            15.0.0-beta.42\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI stepped through the date pipe code, and I believe this line is the cause:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/950a5540f15118e7360506ad82ec9dab5a11f789/packages/common/src/i18n/format_date.ts#L846\r\n\r\nWhen `date.setMinutes` is called, if the resulting date lands between hours 02:00 and 03:00 on March 10, the time is coerced to be on or after 03:00.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Drop support for older platforms ([#&#8203;3902](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3902))\n\n    This release drops support for the following operating system:\n\n    -   macOS 10.15 Catalina\n\n    This is because the Go programming language dropped support for this operating system version in Go 1.23, and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.22 to Go 1.23. Go 1.23 now requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.\n\n    Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the esbuild npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.23). That might look something like this:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\n        cd esbuild\n        go build ./cmd/esbuild\n        ./esbuild --version\n\n-   Fix class field decorators in TypeScript if `useDefineForClassFields` is `false` ([#&#8203;3913](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3913))\n\n    Setting the `useDefineForClassFields` flag to `false` in `tsconfig.json` means class fields use the legacy TypeScript behavior instead of the standard JavaScript behavior. Specifically they use assign semantics instead of define semantics (e.g. setters are triggered) and fields without an initializer are not initialized at all. However, when this legacy behavior is combined with standard JavaScript decorators, TypeScript switches to always initializing all fields, even those without initializers. Previously esbuild incorrectly continued to omit field initializers for this edge case. These field initializers in this case should now be emitted starting with this release.\n\n-   Avoid incorrect cycle warning with `tsconfig.json` multiple inheritance ([#&#8203;3898](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3898))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 introduced multiple inheritance for `tsconfig.json` files where `extends` can be an array of file paths. Previously esbuild would incorrectly treat files encountered more than once when processing separate subtrees of the multiple inheritance hierarchy as an inheritance cycle. With this release, `tsconfig.json` files containing this edge case should work correctly without generating a warning.\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play stack overflow with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3915](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3915))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map could cause a stack overflow when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around more issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3917](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3917))\n\n    This version of Deno broke the `stdin` and `stdout` properties on command objects for inherited streams, which matters when you run esbuild's Deno module as the entry point (i.e. when `import.meta.main` is `true`). Previously esbuild would crash in Deno 1.31+ if you ran esbuild like that. This should be fixed starting with this release.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;Joshix-1](https://redirect.github.com/Joshix-1).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.22.4`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4224)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.22.3...v4.22.4)\n\n*2024-09-21*\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fix a vulnerability in generated code that affects IIFE, UMD and CJS bundles when run in a browser context ([#&#8203;5671](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5671))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5670](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5670): refactor: Use object.prototype to check for reserved properties ([@&#8203;YuHyeonWook](https://redirect.github.com/YuHyeonWook))\n-   [#&#8203;5671](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5671): Fix DOM Clobbering CVE ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://redirect.github.com/lukastaegert))\n\n### [`v4.22.3`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4223)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.22.2...v4.22.3)\n\n*2024-09-21*\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Ensure that mutations in modules without side effects are observed while properly handling transitive dependencies ([#&#8203;5669](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5669))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5669](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5669): Ensure impure dependencies of pure modules are added ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://redirect.github.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

All of the existing JS code is currently in the main `public` assets folder so is copied verbatim into the `dist` folder.   All of the code is ESM format .mjs files.\r\n\r\nMuch of the code is generic JS  and not components, etc.   I wish to gradually rewrite these into TypeScript, so that they can be imported by both the existing code and new Angular components with full type checking and intellisense.\r\n\r\nThis implies a transpiling step, and I would dearly love for this to be automated via the `watch` system so that `ng serve` notices changes and automatically reloads the code on edit.

This discrepancy between my development environment and my production application is jarring, is backwards-incompatible with existing Angular behavior from 2-17, and is even against Vite's guidance about routing when doing SSR -- see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Use vite's connect instance as middleware. If you use your own\r\n  // express router (express.Router()), you should use router.use\r\n  // When the server restarts (for example after the user modifies\r\n  // vite.config.js), `vite.middlewares` is still going to be the same\r\n  // reference (with a new internal stack of Vite and plugin-injected\r\n  // middlewares). The following is valid even after restarts.\r\n  app.use(vite.middlewares)\r\n\r\n  app.use('*', async (req, res) => {\r\n    // serve index.html - we will tackle this next\r\n  })\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe solutions proposed by @alan-agius4 are not helpful. The first isn't a solution, it is just the problem restated. The second isn't a solution, it's a \"do this other thing instead\".\r\n\r\n> Make no changes, but be aware that refreshing the page will not work when using ng serve.\r\n> Remove .html extensions from URLs. To avoid affecting SEO, you can create a server rule that redirects .html URLs to the corresponding pages without extensions using a 301 redirect. This is the recommended long-term approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commentary here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27905#issuecomment-2185785230 is widely applicable to \"non-html\" routes like `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc. Unfortunately, however, we're not talking about those, we're talking about `.html`, the **type of document that Angular is returning**.\r\n\r\n> This is expected, since the extensions matches a mime type, Including file extensions in routes is often due to legacy systems or a desire for clarity. However, this practice isn't ideal for SPAs as modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs. They enhance user experience, aid SEO, and ensure consistency across routes.\r\n\r\nThis is irrelevant fluff. \"Modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs\" is an arbitrary take on the web's current state ignoring the history of browsers as document renderers.

I like the proposal of @ShacharHarshuv https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51786, and it provides some good ideas about a simplistic API aligned to signals. However, there are still many things to consider (custom control values that are non-primitives and can cause confusion with groups (TValue first vs TControl first discussion in Typed forms discussion).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it would be great to have some updates to the existing form modules that would allow us to work with signal-based state when handling forms. Also, it would be great to expose any form-based state as reactive values contrary to the sometimes limited `valueChanges` and `statusChanges`. This would allow the combination of form state using `computed` and the execution of side-effects using `effect` to fulfil many form handling use cases.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to include signals for all relevant form states within `AbstractControl` and update them whenever the local state of the form controls gets updated. This way, developers can benefit from the new reactive form state in both reactive and template-driven forms since NgForm / NgModel uses `AbstractControl` under the hood. This is a feasible and non-intrusive alternative before a possible rewrite of the Form Module.\r\n\r\nWithin this proposal, the signals of `AbstractControl` that represent the form controls state are grouped within a new `signals` object inside `AbstractControl`. This allows the regular form state and signals to coexist without causing name clashes or overcomplicated lengthy prefixes. This also encourages the extraction of specific signals using destructuring `const {value, valid} = myControl.signals;`.\r\n\r\nFor template-driven forms using `NgForm` and `NgModel`, the current idea is to provide a way to inject your signals from your component into the controls using `ngFormOptions` and `ngModelOptions`. Since the developer does not have control over the form control creation in template-driven forms, that's the simplest way to connect forms created within the template to some signals within your component. An alternative idea would be to obtain the `NgModel` directive within the component using `ViewChild` and then receive the signals from the exposed control. However, that would require you to wait for `AfterViewInit` or even `AfterViewChecked`, and this would compromise the declarative approach, which is possible by passing manually created signals into the controls.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-capacity',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>Reservations: {{reservations()}}</p>\r\n    <p>Capacity: <input type=\"number\" [formControl]=\"capacity\" /></p>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class CapacityComponent {\r\n  capacity = new FormControl(5, {nonNullable: true});\r\n  reservations = signal(0);\r\n  interval = setInterval(() => this.reservations.update(count => count + 1), 1000);\r\n  hasCapacity = computed(() => this.capacity.signals.value() > this.reservations());\r\n  capacityEffect = effect(() => console.log(this.hasCapacity() ? 'We have some capacity!' : 'No capacity!'));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis simple example with reactive forms shows that even when `FormControl` does not natively use signals, we still benefit from the newly exposed signals object and can create larger reactive constructs quite declaratively.\r\n\r\nWith template-driven forms, we can achieve similar reactive handling by using the `ngFormOptions` and `ngModelOptions` directive inputs.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-simple-template',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <input type=\"text\" reqired ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{signals: {value: searchQuery}}\" />\r\n    <div>Results: {{results()}}</div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class SimpleTemplateComponent {\r\n  searchService = inject(SearchService);\r\n  searchQuery = signal('');\r\n  results = signal([] as string[]);\r\n  searchEffect = effect(async () => {\r\n    if (this.searchQuery().length > 3) {\r\n      this.results.set(await lastValueFrom(this.searchService.search(this.searchQuery())));\r\n    }\r\n  }, {allowSignalWrites: true})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr a little more complex template-driven form:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-template-driven-form-signals-option',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <form #form=\"ngForm\" [ngFormOptions]=\"{signals: formSignals}\">\r\n      <label>\r\n        First Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" required name=\"firstName\"\r\n               ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{signals: firstNameSignals}\"\r\n               [style.border]=\"firstNameInvalid() ? '1px solid red' : undefined\"/>\r\n      </label>\r\n      <label>\r\n        Last Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n\r\n      <p>Full name: {{ fullName() }}</p>\r\n      @if (showErrors()) {\r\n        <p>Form contains errors</p>\r\n      }\r\n    </form>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class TemplateDrivenFormSignalsOptionComponent {\r\n  formSignals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n    value: signal({ firstName: '', lastName: '' })\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<{firstName: string; lastName: string}>>;\r\n\r\n  firstNameSignals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<string>>;\r\n\r\n  fullName = computed(\r\n    () => `${this.formSignals.value().firstName} ${this.formSignals.value().lastName}`\r\n  );\r\n  showErrors = computed(\r\n    () => this.formSignals.invalid() && this.formSignals.dirty()\r\n  );\r\n  firstNameInvalid = computed(() => this.firstNameSignals.invalid() && this.firstNameSignals.dirty());\r\n  logFullname = effect(() => {\r\n    console.log(`Full name: ${this.fullName()}`);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've created a draft PR with the changes required for this new feature. The draft PR does not contain any tests, no documentation and probably has a few bugs. https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53481\r\n\r\nI've also published the forms module containing those changes to a temporary NPM package and included it in a stackblitz for you to play around: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uyjg2x?file=src%2Freactive-form.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form-signals-option.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form.component.ts,src%2Fsignal-based-forms.component.ts\r\n\r\nI would love to hear your feedback, thoughts and ideas!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nGion\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nn/a","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signals for Reactive and Template-based Forms\" (#53485)"},{"Id":"2034471019","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T17:57:39","Actor":"kukjevov","Number":"53484","RawContent":null,"Title":"FEATURE: configurable signals change detection method","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nI would like to have options/possibility to create signals with option that allows to set type of change detection that should be used when signal changes, especially for components or directives.\r\n\r\nRight now there are two ways how to run change detection. `MarkForCheck` which is asynchronous way or `DetectChanges` which is synchronous way.\r\n\r\nFirst one is currently used with signals.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular forms don't support signals natively. Although through AbstractFormControl, valueChanges and statusChanges can be used together with reactive helpers to extract signals, there are certain drawbacks with this approach:\r\n- No native feel\r\n- Boilerplate to convert observables to signals\r\n- Reactivity was always only partially provided with reactive forms (only values and status changes, not raw values and control state changes like pristine, touched, etc.)\r\n- Provided the simplicity of the new reactive primitives, it's highly desirable to add a template-driven simple form approach that is backed up with a powerful but straightforward reactive concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n- Form controls expose additional signals for each relevant control state, grouped by a new `signals` property on the control objects.\r\n- By default, signals are created internally and can be accessed through the control object `control.signals.value()`. This allows a side-by-side existence with the previous regular form state handling.\r\n- In ngForm / ngModel based forms, we can't govern the form control creation. Therefore, a different approach was used to pass a new optional signals option to ngFormOptions and ngModelOptions. Using that approach, developers can create their signals in the component and pass them to the template-driven form directives, where they will be added to the respective controls.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n## Signal-based forms (template-driven forms with signals for reactivity)\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { Component, computed, effect, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AbstractControlSignals, FormsModule } from 'angular-signal-forms';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-signal-based-form',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h1>Simple template driven signal-based form</h1>\r\n    <form #form=\"ngForm\" [ngFormOptions]=\"{signals}\">\r\n      <label>\r\n        First Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" required name=\"firstName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n      <label>\r\n        Last Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n\r\n      <p>Full name: {{ fullName() }}</p>\r\n      @if (showErrors()) {\r\n        <p>Form contains errors</p>\r\n      }\r\n    </form>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class SignalBasedFormComponent {\r\n  signals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n    value: signal({ firstName: '', lastName: '' })\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<{firstName: string; lastName: string}>>;\r\n  fullName = computed(\r\n    () => `${this.signals.value().firstName} ${this.signals.value().lastName}`\r\n  );\r\n  showErrors = computed(\r\n    () => this.signals.invalid() && this.signals.dirty()\r\n  );\r\n  logFullname = effect(() => {\r\n    console.log(`Full name: ${this.fullName()}`);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check out this Stackblitz with the updated Angular Forms package:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uyjg2x?file=src%2Freactive-form.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form-signals-option.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form.component.ts,src%2Fsignal-based-forms.component.ts\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your feedback on this idea / proposal.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nGion\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53481","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): WIP / Proposal, signals in reactive and template driven forms\" (#53481)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2036806701","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-12T01:24:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"26636","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): cache loading of component resources in JIT mode","State":"open","Body":"The load result caching capabilities of the Angular compiler plugin used within the `application` and `browser-esbuild` builders is now used for both stylesheet and template component resources when building in JIT mode.

CSS gradient syntax for older browsers\n\n    The specification called [CSS Images Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/) introduces new CSS gradient syntax for customizing how the browser interpolates colors in between color stops. You can now control the color space that the interpolation happens in as well as (for \"polar\" color spaces) control whether hue angle interpolation happens clockwise or counterclockwise. You can read more about this in [Mozilla's blog post about new CSS gradient features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/css-color-module-level-4/).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically transform this syntax for older browsers in the `target` list. For example, here's a gradient that should appear as a rainbow in a browser that supports this new syntax:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .rainbow-gradient {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: linear-gradient(in hsl longer hue, #&#8203;7ff, #&#8203;77f);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome99) */\n    .rainbow-gradient {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        linear-gradient(\n          #&#8203;77ffff,\n          #&#8203;77ffaa 12.5%,\n          #&#8203;77ff80 18.75%,\n          #&#8203;84ff77 21.88%,\n          #&#8203;99ff77 25%,\n          #eeff77 37.5%,\n          #fffb77 40.62%,\n          #ffe577 43.75%,\n          #ffbb77 50%,\n          #ff9077 56.25%,\n          #ff7b77 59.38%,\n          #ff7788 62.5%,\n          #ff77dd 75%,\n          #ff77f2 78.12%,\n          #f777ff 81.25%,\n          #cc77ff 87.5%,\n          #&#8203;7777ff);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can now use this syntax in your CSS source code and esbuild will automatically convert it to an equivalent gradient for older browsers. In addition, esbuild will now also transform \"double position\" and \"transition hint\" syntax for older browsers as appropriate:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .stripes {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: linear-gradient(#e65 33%, #ff2 33% 67%, #&#8203;99e 67%);\n    }\n    .glow {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: radial-gradient(white 10%, 20%, black);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome33) */\n    .stripes {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        linear-gradient(\n          #e65 33%,\n          #ff2 33%,\n          #ff2 67%,\n          #&#8203;99e 67%);\n    }\n    .glow {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        radial-gradient(\n          #ffffff 10%,\n          #aaaaaa 12.81%,\n          #&#8203;959595 15.62%,\n          #&#8203;7b7b7b 21.25%,\n          #&#8203;5a5a5a 32.5%,\n          #&#8203;444444 43.75%,\n          #&#8203;323232 55%,\n          #&#8203;161616 77.5%,\n          #&#8203;000000);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can see visual examples of these new syntax features by looking at [esbuild's gradient transformation tests](https://esbuild.github.io/gradient-tests/).\n\n    If necessary, esbuild will construct a new gradient that approximates the original gradient by recursively splitting the interval in between color stops until the approximation error is within a small threshold. That is why the above output CSS contains many more color stops than the input CSS.\n\n    Note that esbuild deliberately *replaces* the original gradient with the approximation instead of inserting the approximation before the original gradient as a fallback. The latest version of Firefox has multiple gradient rendering bugs (including incorrect interpolation of partially-transparent colors and interpolating non-sRGB colors using the incorrect color space). If esbuild didn't replace the original gradient, then Firefox would use the original gradient instead of the fallback the appearance would be incorrect in Firefox. In other words, the latest version of Firefox supports modern gradient syntax but interprets it incorrectly.\n\n-   Add support for `color()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, and `hwb()` in CSS\n\n    CSS has recently added lots of new ways of specifying colors. You can read more about this in [Chrome's blog post about CSS color spaces](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide).\n\n    This release adds support for minifying colors that use the `color()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, or `hwb()` syntax and/or transforming these colors for browsers that don't support it yet:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      color: hwb(90deg 20% 40%);\n      background: color(display-p3 1 0 0);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome99) */\n    div {\n      color: #&#8203;669933;\n      background: #ff0f0e;\n      background: color(display-p3 1 0 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    As you can see, colors outside of the sRGB color space such as `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` are mapped back into the sRGB gamut and inserted as a fallback for browsers that don't support the new color syntax.\n\n-   Allow empty type parameter lists in certain cases ([#&#8203;3512](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3512))\n\n    TypeScript allows interface declarations and type aliases to have empty type parameter lists.

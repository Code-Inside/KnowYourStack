For example:\n\n- In custom grid components (like Syncfusion EJ2 Grid), columns are defined in templates as <e-column field=\"name\" headerText=\"Name\" />. When Field is imported from @angular/forms/signals, Angular's template compiler interprets field as the signal forms directive instead of a plain property, causing binding failures or errors.\nSimilarly, in Gantt components (e.g., Telerik Kendo UI for Angular Gantt), field is used for column/data bindings, leading to the same issue. The import alias is also not working in this case.\n- Similar issue is found in the Telerik Kendo components too.\n- This is reproducible in a minimal standalone setup where both Field and the grid module are imported in the same component. Here's a StackBlitz demo showing the clash: [StackBlitz sample](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-oz2ou1vb?file=src%2Fmain.ts) .\n \n**Questions**:\n- Is there a recommended way to resolve or workaround this without refactoring templates or splitting everything into child components (which isn't scalable for apps with many grids)?\n- Any plans to rename the Field module or add namespace/alias options to avoid global conflicts before stabilizing the feature?\nThanks for your time—happy to provide more details or test potential fixes!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-oz2ou1vb?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66086","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Conflict in the import of Field from forms package\" (#66086)"},{"Id":"3728737828","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T19:43:07","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"66064","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all github actions to v6 (main) (major)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/upload-artifact](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact) | action | major | `v5.0.0` -> `v6.0.0` |\n| [actions/upload-artifact](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact) | action | major | `v5` -> `v6` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/upload-artifact (actions/upload-artifact)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/releases/tag/v6.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v5.0.0...v6.0.0)\n\n#### v6 - What's new\n\n> \\[!IMPORTANT]\n> actions/upload-artifact\\@&#8203;v6 now runs on Node.js 24 (`runs.using: node24`) and requires a minimum Actions Runner version of 2.327.1.

I have noticed unusual behavior during the initial page load involving application initializers and component lifecycle hooks.\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n* **Angular Version:** 20.x.x\n* **SSR:** Enabled with Client Hydration (`provideClientHydration()`)\n* **Data Fetching:** A required HTTP request is initiated inside a function provided via `provideAppInitializer()` (or inside the `AppComponent`'s `constructor`/`ngOnInit`).\n* **State Transfer:** Configured correctly (the client is successfully reusing the first server response).\n\n**The Observed Behavior:**\n\nOn a fresh page load, my logging shows that the root component's `constructor`, `ngOnInit`, and the `provideAppInitializer` callback are executed **three times** in the following sequence:\n\n| Execution Event | Environment | HTTP Request Made? | Expected Behavior? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1st Hook Run** | Server (Node.js) | **YES** | **Expected:** Initial Server Render |\n| **2nd Hook Run** | Browser (Client) | **NO** (Transferred) | **Expected:** Client Hydration |\n| **3rd Hook Run** | **Server (Node.js)** | **YES** | **UNEXPECTED** |\n\n**The Anomaly:**\n\nThe most confusing part is the **third execution, which occurs on the server again** *after* the client has started the hydration process. This third execution triggers a second, redundant HTTP request from the server, causing unnecessary load.\n\n* **Total Hook/Initializer Runs:** 3 (Server, Client, Server)\n* **Total HTTP Requests:** 2 (Both from the Server)\n\n**My Question:**\n\nIs this triple execution and the resulting extra server-side HTTP call a known issue, or does it indicate an incorrect configuration or a deeper problem with how I am utilizing `provideAppInitializer` alongside modern Angular SSR and Hydration?\n\nThank you for any insight or guidance!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32125","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular SSR/Hydration: Unexplained Third Execution of Initializer/Hooks on Server\" (#32125)"},{"Id":"3730422276","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T13:37:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32126","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/ssr): skip SSR processing for well-known non-Angular URLs like favicon.ico","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nSkip processing of well known non Angular files.\r\n\r\nCloses: #32125\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32126","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/ssr): skip SSR processing for well-known non-Angular URLs like favicon.ico\" (#32126)"},{"Id":"3724612545","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T12:10:06","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32118","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/architect-cli): remove unused progress bar functionality","State":"closed","Body":"The progress bar functionality within the Angular builders was not utilized, making the 'progress' dependency unnecessary.

While the application is running hit, the \"npm: start\" task is in the \"running\" state, although the compilation is already finished:\n\n<img width=\"1252\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4d30b01-2b16-4b40-96b8-ddc7e0eb5d18\" />\n\nSuggested Fix\n==========\n\nThe core issue is a bad `beginsPattern` in `.vscode/start.json`:\n\n```\n        \"background\": {\n          \"activeOnStart\": true,\n          \"beginsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"(.*?)\"\n          },\n          \"endsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"bundle generation complete\"\n          }\n        }\n```\n\nWhile the `endsPattern` is correct and allows VS Code to detect when the initial bundle generation is complete (and thus start the debugging in the first iteration), the `beginsPattern` matches basically anything and causes the task to transistion into the \"running\" state immediately after detecting the `endsPattern`. In this case, the `beginsPattern` likely already matches on the full stop following \"bunde generation complete\":\n\n```\nInitial chunk files | Names         | Raw size\nmain.js             | main          |  2.45 kB | \nstyles.css          | styles        | 95 bytes | \n\n                    | Initial total |  2.55 kB\n\nApplication bundle generation complete. [6.448 seconds] - 2025-12-12T09:53:41.614Z\n```\n\nThis causes Visual Studio to assume that another background compilation is in progress. A sensible `beginsPattern` is `\"Changes detected\"`.\n\nTo validate whether the `beginsPattern` actually hits, I monkey-patched `node_modules\\@angular\\build\\src\\builders\\application\\build-action.js` near line 150 to add a delay that makes the \"task running\" state visible in VS Code:\n\n```\n            // Clear removed files from current watch files\n            changes.removed.forEach((removedPath) => currentWatchFiles.delete(removedPath));\n            const rebuildState = result.createRebuildState(changes);\n            result = await withProgress('Changes detected. Rebuilding...', () => action(rebuildState));\n            await (new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)));  // INSERTED DELAY\n            // Log all diagnostic (error/warning/logs) messages\n            await (0, utils_1.logMessages)(logger, result, colors, jsonLogs);\n```\n\nSide issue\n=======\n\nThe `endsPattern` only matched *successful* compilation, keeping the job in running state if the compilation failed. This is likely also not intended. So I suggest an `endsPattern` of `\"bundle generation (complete|failed)\"`.\n\nThe improved `tasks.json` now looks like:\n\n```\n{\n  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"npm\",\n      \"script\": \"start\",\n      \"isBackground\": true,\n      \"problemMatcher\": {\n        \"owner\": \"typescript\",\n        \"pattern\": \"$tsc\",\n        \"background\": {\n          \"activeOnStart\": true,\n          \"beginsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"Changes detected\"\n          },\n          \"endsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"bundle generation (complete|failed)\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32111","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"start task always displayed as \"running\" in VS Code\" (#32111)"},{"Id":"3722865483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-13T00:50:46","Actor":"karcherm","Number":"32112","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular) VS Code background compilation start/end patterns","State":"closed","Body":"The task is initially \"active\", and should be considered \"completed\" when the bundle generation result is displayed, even if the generation failed.

If no element is active, it must be set to an empty string.\n\nCause:\nThe `aria-activedescendant` is entirely absent from the composite UI element.\n\nEffect:\nScreen readers may provide inaccurate information, leading to difficulties for keyboard and screen reader users in navigating and interacting with the component.\n\nSuggested Solution:\nEnsure that the `aria-activedescendant` attribute is pointing to the ID of an appropriate child element, according to the role of the composite UI element. When users navigate between children using the arrow keys, the `aria-activedescendant` attribute should be updated accordingly.\n\nSelector: mat-chip-grid\n\nHTML Snippet:\n```HTML\n <!--NOTE: snippet was trimmed due to its size--><mat-chip-grid _ngcontent-ng-c4270193721=\"\" aria-label=\"Fruit selection\" class=\"mat-mdc-chip-set mat-mdc-chip-grid mdc-evolution-chip-set\" aria-hidden=\"false\" role=\"grid\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\"><div role=\"presentation\" class=\"mdc-evolution-chip-set__chips\"><mat-chip-row _ngcontent-ng-c4270193721=\"\" class=\"mat-mdc-chip mat-mdc-chip-row mdc-evolution-chip mat-primary mdc-evolution-chip--with-trailing-action mat-mdc-standard-chip mat-mdc-chip-with-trailing-icon ng-star-inserted\" mat-ripple-loader-uninitialized=\"\" mat-ripple-loader-class-name=\"mat-mdc-chip-ripple\" mat-ripple-loader-disabled=\"\" id=\"mat-mdc-chip-0\" role=\"row\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"mat-mdc-chip-focus-overlay ng-star-inserted\"></span><span role=\"gridcell\" matchipaction=\"\" class=\"mdc-evolution-chip__action mat-mdc-chip-action mdc-evolution-chip__cell mdc-evolution-chip__cell--primary mdc-evolution-chip__action--primary\" aria-describedby=\"mat-mdc-chip-0-aria-description\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-disabled=\"false\"><span cl\n```\n\nComponent: undefined\nKnowledge Base: https://knowledge.evinced.com/system-validations/missing-active-descendant\nWCAG Violations: [1.3.1 Info and Relationships  (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)\nEvinced Severity: CRITICAL\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[Mat Chip Grid connected to input](https://material.angular.dev/components/chips/overview#chips-connected-to-an-input-field)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

The interaction with `mat-chip-grid` is happening not fully through the formControl. For now the source of chips's list is `keywords` signal, not the formControl: `@for (keyword of keywords(); track keyword) {`\nIt seems we should take the formControl as the source of chips's list (not the signal): `@for (keyword of formControl.value || []; track keyword) {` \nMoreover we could get rid of the signal, because the  goal of the example is to show the interaction between the formControl and the chips in the template. \n \n2.

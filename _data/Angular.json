{"Data":{"Angular-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2796520756","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-18T00:30:26","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"59602","RawContent":null,"Title":"⚠️ Local development bugs with HMR","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWe're aware of reports of local development bugs arising from Angular template HMR in 19.1.x, which has been enabled by default.\n\nList of known issues:\n\n* #59581\n* #59592\n* angular/angular-cli#29248\n\nWe're actively investigating and fixing these issues to create a smooth HMR experience out of the box. Production builds and releases are not affected. If you discover any additional HMR challenges which don't appear to be related to the linked issues above, verify that you are on a recent version (19.1.x), and please [file a new issue](http://github.com/angular/angular/issues/) and link it here so we can triage and investigate.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn the meantime, if you encounter any problems relating to HMR, you can work around them in three ways:\n\n1. Refresh the page \\- This loads a fresh copy of your application with up to date code.  \n2. `ng serve \\--no-hmr` \\- This disables HMR for your local devserver and automatically refreshes the page on any code changes.  \n3. Disable HMR for your project \\- Configuring `angular.json` will disable HMR for all `ng serve` invocations by default.  \n   * This is useful for a project with a large number of developers without needing to communicate these workarounds to all contributors.  \n   * Remember to re-enable once the relevant issues are fixed\\!\n\n```json\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"my-project\": {\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"serve\": {\n          \"options\": {\n            \"hmr\": false\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThank you for sharing any HMR issues and helping improve Angular one bugfix at a time. We're committed to fully stabilizing this feature and excited to bring improved build performance to everyone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"⚠️ Local development bugs with HMR\" (#59602)"},{"Id":"2795657862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T18:00:59","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59598","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): cleanup stash listener when app is destroyed","State":"closed","Body":"In this commit, we clean up the reference to the function set by the environment initializer, as the function closure may capture injected elements and prevent them from being properly garbage collected.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59598","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): cleanup stash listener when app is destroyed\" (#59598)"},{"Id":"2793305240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T18:00:02","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"59572","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): reuse setupStaticAttributes in ComponentRef","State":"closed","Body":"This change refactor how the dynamically created component deals with attributes in order to reuse the existing setupStaticAttributes logic (instead of having specific and similar code).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): reuse setupStaticAttributes in ComponentRef\" (#59572)"},{"Id":"2795988669","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T17:41:35","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"59601","RawContent":null,"Title":"Runtime refactor component ref followup","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nSCSS files are scattered across a few directories. There is some duplication as well.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n1. Move all styles in a single folder as close as possible to `ng-devtools` component – as stated in the section above there had been SCSS files that resided in the app wrappers (the shell and demo apps) or the main `devtools/` directory. There were also duplicated browser-specific SCSS files in each app wrapper. This change should, hopefully, make style management a bit easier. Each app wrapper still retains a `styles.scss` which should ultimately be used only for applying styles that are specific to that app wrapper, not the devtools.\r\n\r\n2. Set a browser class to the document body – this is an improvement of #46037. Basically, additionally to loading browser-specific global styles, we also set a browser-specific class to the body. We can use that for any granular or component-based styles.\r\n\r\n3. SCSS mixins – right now the theme styles are applied via `:host-context(<THEME-CLASS>)`. What the mixins do is to encapsulate that logic in case it changes (or the class names change). The mixins also provide a parameter for targeting a specific browser. Eventually, some of these mixins might render useless, so we can drop them.\r\n\r\n**Next changes**\r\n\r\n- Converting to the theme mixins\r\n- Extracting some of the colors and creating actual themes based on them\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59589","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(devtools): styles management\" (#59589)"},{"Id":"2794608383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T09:45:40","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"59584","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(platform-server): fix flaky incremental hydration test","State":"closed","Body":"This commit updates a test setup to define a global `ngServerMode` correctly for a test that was emulating client-only behavior.

However, this is the rendered body of `<app-root>`, using either file-based or inline template:\n\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1 </app-root>\n```\n\nOther variants\n\nRemoving `<app-b />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-c></app-c> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nRemoving `<app-c />`\n```html\n<app-root ng-version=\"19.1.1\"><app-a><p> a works! </p></app-a><app-b><p> b works! </p></app-b> 19.1.1</app-root>\n````\n\nTrends:\n\n- When removing A or B, C's host element stays but is empty. But when removing C, A and B properly render and there is no C.\n- Not really an issue with non component HTML elements, such as a `<p>stuff</p>` tag in the `<app-root />` template. And the untagged full version I had for my reference was also fine. However, components still are spotty like above when removed and in the same template as primitive elements or text (edited: clarify).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/msmallest/hmr-issue-multiple-components\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nMy reproduction has 3 branches. \n\n- `main` aka CLI generated with a 19.1.1 global\n- `19.1.1` aka I bumped `main` with the actual latest in the `package.json`\n- `nightlies-19.1.1+` that points at all the nightlies (edit: and resolved with `--force`).\n\nMy examples I pasted were from `main`.

I have unit tests for this, which pass.  When I upgrade to Angualr 19, my tests no longer passed.  It seemed to be an issue with how `tick` works, which I see mentioned in [the release notes here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#core-8)\n\n> The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync` and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\nHere is my service:\n```ts\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\nexport class TimerService {\n  private isRunningSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(false);\n  private totalDurationMin = 0;\n  private totalDurationMinutesSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.totalDurationMin);\n  private timerSubscription = new Subscription();\n\n  public totalDurationMinutes$ = this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.asObservable();\n  public isRunning$ = this.isRunningSubject$.asObservable();\n\n  public start(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(true);\n    this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n\n    this.timerSubscription = interval(60 * 1000).subscribe({\n      next: () => {\n        this.totalDurationMin++;\n        this.totalDurationMinutesSubject$.next(this.totalDurationMin);\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  public stop(): void {\n    this.isRunningSubject$.next(false);\n    this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is my unit test which passes in Angular 18, but fails in 19\n\n```ts\nit('should update the observables and start the timer', fakeAsync(() => {\n  //skip initial emit, the start of the timer, and then then next 4 minute ticks\n  service.totalDurationMinutes$.pipe(skip(6)).subscribe({\n    next: (val) => {\n      console.log(`minutes: ${val}`);\n      expect(val).toEqual(5);\n    },\n  });\n\n  service.start();\n  tick(60 * 1000 * 5); //simulate 5 minutes passing\n\n  discardPeriodicTasks();\n}));\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n - [Angular 18](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rbkdn2wp?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n - [Angular 19](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-jasmine-rvqhvurf?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftimer.service.spec.ts)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n\nThe unit test fails with `Expected 6 to equal 5.`\n\nYou'll notice that in v18, the console output contains\n```\nminutes: 5\n```\nand in v19 it contains\n```\nminutes: 5\nminutes: 6\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59577","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`tick` fires too many times in v19 compared to v18 in unit tests\" (#59577)"},{"Id":"2793884294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T22:07:54","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"59576","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature(compiler): Add Skip Hydration diagnostic.","State":"open","Body":"The diagnostic was created in #49512 but was never added to the list of diagnostic that run.\r\n\r\nfixes #59569\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this PR enables a diagnostic, we'll need a TGP.

Flushing the animations when a component is replaced to ensure that the renderer is cleaned up in a timely manner.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59574","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): animation sometimes renderer not being destroyed during HMR\" (#59574)"},{"Id":"2793190833","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-16T18:40:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"59571","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies to v19.2.0-next.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | minor | [`19.1.0-rc.0` -> `19.2.0-next.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk/19.1.0-rc.0/19.2.0-next.0) |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | peerDependencies | minor | [`^19.1.0-next` -> `^19.2.0-next`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk/19.1.0/19.2.0-next.0) |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | dependencies | minor | [`19.1.0-rc.0` -> `19.2.0-next.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/19.1.0-rc.0/19.2.0-next.0) |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | peerDependencies | minor | [`^19.1.0-next` -> `^19.2.0-next`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/19.1.0/19.2.0-next.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v19.2.0-next.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1920-next0-bronze-baguette-2025-01-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/19.1.0...19.2.0-next.0)\n\n##### material\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [44c7320653](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/44c732065319522351f2f17d1294639b149f81c5) | feat | **schematics:** Add option to customize colors for neutral variant and error palettes ([#&#8203;30321](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30321)) |\n| [1e5663636e](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/1e5663636eb38d5556f500840dd7e00dd9950b70) | fix | **stepper:** switch away from animations module ([#&#8203;30314](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30314)) |\n| [0eb9012777](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/0eb901277742e23a0528342252051b8e007a7615) | fix | **tabs:** switch away from animations module ([#&#8203;30281](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30281)) |\n| [e5c3ddfb0b](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/e5c3ddfb0b14afab3eb7da1b593fed1c699ef1bb) | fix | **timepicker:** adds default aria-label to timepicker toggle ([#&#8203;30284](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30284)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v19.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1910-denim-firefly-2025-01-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/19.1.0-rc.0...19.1.0)\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [62a672af0d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/62a672af0d6cb2195633a1cbf6c39472104767f9) | feat | **dialog:** expose cdk dialog docs ([#&#8203;1144](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/1144)) |\n| [a0a16fc70e](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/a0a16fc70e1fed7fbb9177c83cf3f670022a321a) | feat | **menu:** expose cdk menu docs ([#&#8203;1142](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/1142)) |\n| [2be0afcfb5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/2be0afcfb54b16dd426e5ad65f6aa52301dc2d45) | fix | **menu:** avoid resetting the scroll position when using the mouse ([#&#8203;30249](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30249)) |\n| [e421765d8d](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/e421765d8d05806be46ff53ce92ed43e4a82dbf9) | fix | **menu:** not responding to position changes ([#&#8203;30234](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30234)) |\n| [5c75bbecb2](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/5c75bbecb24f49779baf86203a7e626d34e39f8c) | fix | **scrolling:** avoid SSR error in CdkVirtualScrollableWindow ([#&#8203;30259](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/pull/30259)) |\n| [d721f0c2bc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/commit/d721f0c2bcfb4bdfe4cc0655d61ca0537a6e4bf5) | perf | **table:** Use afterNextRender for sticky styling.

\n\nI hope this catch you well ,our organization is leveraging Angular in order to develop a large-scale web application , choosing Angular was my own decision as the framework is the most organized framework out  there without any bias (: . \n\nYou know how important for any organization to cut the maintenance costs by making it easy for developers to quickly add new features and scale up the software easily thank to the Angular way of separating folders and providing a well-organized file structures. \n\nIn our case , we are developing a multi-language software and our default language is Arabic which is a unique-styled language as you all know , it is a RTL not LTR. \n\nWe can easily support RTL of course by leveraging the built-in i18n or other third parties libraries and this was done by our fellow developers several time.\n\n**The issue :**  \n\nWhen the user browse the application in RTL-mode  we don't need to load the resources and CCS files of other LTR files this of course is a well-performant way as we get rid of unnecessary resources but.\n\n\n\n\n- Best appreciations and regards \nMohssine Khaloufi\n   \n\n### Proposed solution\n\n**The  suggested Solution :**  \n\nWe need a mechanism to add a folder or a file within each component called **\"componnent-rtl-css.css\"** that loads depends on the selected local, this will indeed make that framework more performant and organized. \n\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of conditionally rendering the component.html file to check the current local (that of course consume memory and impact the performance) , why we don't just built-it by default so, we don't worry about which resource to put in action every time we switch the locals.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"VERY HELPFUL AND IMPORTANT --- RTL separated CSS files.\" (#59570)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2796523836","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-18T00:32:04","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"29392","RawContent":null,"Title":"⚠️ Local development bugs with HMR","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWe're aware of reports of local development bugs arising from Angular template HMR in 19.1.x, which has been enabled by default.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59602 for more context and workarounds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29392","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"⚠️ Local development bugs with HMR\" (#29392)"},{"Id":"2796421778","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T22:47:04","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"29391","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.1.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29391","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.1.2 release\" (#29391)"},{"Id":"2796347478","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T22:41:14","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"29390","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.1.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29390","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.1.2\" with changelog.\" (#29390)"},{"Id":"2796183019","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T21:29:02","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29389","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): add console message to dev server when component HMR is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"An informational message has been added to the development server to ensure that users are aware that component HMR has been enabled and provide actionable steps in the event that an application reload may not behave as expected.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29389","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): add console message to dev server when component HMR is enabled\" (#29389)"},{"Id":"2795802402","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T18:18:27","Actor":"clydin","Number":"29387","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): reset component updates on dev-server index request","State":"closed","Body":"An index request from a client browser indicates a full page reload of the application should occur.

To get around this I created a separate api.ts that could be run independently, or from within server.ts. I also created an environments file to switch between the endpoints based on dev mode or production mode.\n\nThis feels hacky but works OK, but then I realized that `ng build` is attempting a prerender WITHOUT my APIs, so it's failing.\n\nWhat's the intended way to use Angular, SSR, and locally hosted APIs?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`ng new test --ssr` (opt out of server routing and app engine apis)\n\nsee server.ts 'Example Express Rest API endpoints can be defined here.' - try doing this.\n\n`ng serve`\nAPIs are missing\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.1\nNode: 22.10.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.1\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.1\n@schematics/angular             19.1.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SSR + Local API is a confusing experience\" (#29377)"},{"Id":"2794237931","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-17T07:27:54","Actor":"princemaple","Number":"29378","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: HMR respect baseHref","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\nHMR via `/@ng/...` doesn't use the `baseHref`\n\nI sometimes start multiple ng serve and use a reverse proxy to serve the apps during dev.

setup again and again. Setting up repository on Ubuntu seems fairly easy & works out of the box but Windows bothers alot. I have been using a Windows 11 for past few months & whenever I find free time to contribute I struggle to run on Windows 10 & 11 all the time.\n\nI have been provided a new laptop & I'm facing issues such as:\n\n1. error Couldn't find match for <package hash> in \"refs/heads/main\" for \"https://github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds.git\".\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install for documentation about this command. \n\nSometimes gets fixed on yarn cache clear, mostly happens whenever I update the work and run yarn after a long time.\n\n2. iBazel [1:54PM]: Error writing failure to stdin: write |1: file already closed\n\nhappens all the time, gets fixed sometimes when I delete bazel folders and end all processes from task manager.\n\n3. iBazel [1:08PM]: Error starting process: fork/exec C:\\Users\\CENTRI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\bazel_script_path4055922069.bat: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\niBazel [1:08PM]: Run start failed fork/exec C:\\Users\\CENTRI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\bazel_script_path4055922069.bat: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\n\nI checked the bat file and its 0kb so I'm not sure whats causing it to generate an empty file.

This way, the actual data can connect with the table columns.

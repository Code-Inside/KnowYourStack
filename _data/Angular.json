Even if I use the `LibInputSearchComponent` component like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<lib-input-search iconSide=\"left\"></lib-input-search>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of `iconSide` will always be `'right'`, since that's what's being set in the constructor.\r\n\r\nSince passing values to a host directive's constructor isn't supported, this provides a major stumbling block when it comes to using a host directive in different scenarios where default values need to be set.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think the best solution would be to add another field to the hostDirectives declarations where you can specify default values:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  directive: SDKControlMixin,\r\n  inputs: ['iconSide'],\r\n  defaultValues: { input: 'iconSide', value: 'right' },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  directive: SDKControlMixin,\r\n  inputs: [{ name: 'iconSide', defaultValue: 'right' }],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese values would override any values set for the @Input. If we take my example given:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Input() iconSide: 'left' | 'right' = 'left';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `iconSide` would only receive a default value of `'left'` if no default value was provided in the host directive declaration.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing an extendable class. However, this is less than ideal since you can't extend multiple classes and it would lead to @Input declarations being available for a component even if they're not actually implemented. This leads to confusion and friction for those consuming the components.

It works by creating native control flow statements inside the TCB which allows us to get features like type narrowing for free. For example, a template like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{#switch expr}\r\n  {:case 1} One\r\n  {:case 2} Two\r\n  {:default} Default\r\n{/switch}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be represented as the following in the TCB:\r\n```\r\nswitch (this.expr) {\r\n  case 1:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n  case 2:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes are split up into a few commits to make them easier to review in isolation. This is an overview of commits:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for switch blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `switch` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `switch` statement inside the TCB which allows us to do type narrowing of the expression.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for if blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `if` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `if` statement inside the TCB which allows us to do type narrowing of the expression. The `as` parameter is implemented by declaring a variable inside the `if` statement.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for loop blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `for` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `for...of` statement inside the TCB. The various loop variables (e.g. `$index`) are implemented by declaring a local number variable.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for tracking expressions\r\nAdds support for template type checking of the `track` expression of a `for` loop block. Tracking expressions are treated as any other expression for type checking, however we have some special validation that doesn't allow them to access template variables and local references.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Template type checking support for control flow\" (#51690)"},{"Id":"1885369607","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-07T08:26:16","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"51689","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: cut the zone.js-0.13.2 release","State":"open","Body":"Cut a new release to include https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51652","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51689","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"release: cut the zone.js-0.13.2 release\" (#51689)"},{"Id":"1885224881","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-07T06:49:08","Actor":"AshishKumar409","Number":"51688","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace twitter logo with 'X' logo in the docs","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nNot a problem, but i think the twitter bird logo should be replaced by new X logo.\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/76529660/76738ed5-fcaa-4ed3-a82c-86a9b1191913)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51688","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Replace twitter logo with 'X' logo in the docs\" (#51688)"},{"Id":"1885161205","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-07T05:51:08","Actor":"wardbell","Number":"51687","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Migrate Service Worker to Standalone","State":"open","Body":"Although there are several pages, only `service-worker-getting-started.md` has an example. That example code was migrated.\r\n\r\nWorked around the few references to NgModule.\r\n\r\nOther changes as follows:\r\n\r\n**Revised \"Getting Started\"**\r\n\r\nThe original service worker example page (`service-worker-getting-started.md`) is full of holes! I don’t know how anyone got this working just by following this page\r\n\r\n- it doesn’t tell you where to get the example (and it isn’t generated by AIO)\r\n- it doesn’t tell you that ng serve doesn’t support service worker apps\r\n- it mentions http-server in passing but not what that is or where to get it.\r\n- several commands tell you to supply the “project-name” but (a) it doesn’t tell you how to find that name and (b) you never actually have to provide a name at all. That includes on the command that gets http-server going.\r\n\r\n**Hid section on `ngsw-config` tool**\r\n\r\nHid the discussion of the `ngsw-config` tool in `service-worker-config.md` because (a) the command invoke it didn't seem to work and (b) it referenced `<project-name>` without explaining what that is or where to find it.\r\n\r\nLeft the hidden text in the page in case someone wants to do something about this.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, you seem to be able to edit the `ngsw-config.json` and then rebuild. That should suffice.\r\n\r\n**Disabled E2E**\r\n\r\nThe AIO CI will no longer attempt to run the (thin) E2E tests.\r\n\r\nThese tests could lightly test the app with the dev server but couldn't test the Service Worker aspects; that would require launching the app with something other than `ng serve` and the AIO CI is not set up for that.\r\n\r\nThe existing tests appeared to pass when run locally with the dev server. However, only one of them actually ran; test runner reported. \"There were tests whose specified size is too big.\"\r\n\r\nDecided to bypass E2E testing of this project for now.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I am not sure this have any connection with the web broswer (as earlier it only happened to Chrome, and I was able to work without any issue on Firefox), but after a update Chrome also started to work. But now `Version 116.0.5845.180 (Official Build) (64-bit)` updated yesterday and since then, loop started. and even in Firefox as well now.

their host bindings refreshed and `ngDoCheck run` during change\n    detection if they are dirty.\n    Previously, a bug in the change detection would result in the `OnPush`\n    configuration of dynamically created components to be ignored when\n    executing host bindings and the `ngDoCheck` function. This is\n    rarely encountered but can happen if code has a handle on the\n    `ComponentRef` instance and updates values read in the `OnPush`\n    component template without then calling either `markForCheck` or\n    `detectChanges` on that component's `ChangeDetectorRef`.\n\n##### router\n\n-   `urlHandlingStrategy` has been removed from the Router public API.\n    This should instead be configured through the provideRouter or RouterModule.forRoot APIs.\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [40bb45f329](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/40bb45f3297359866cab39044dba06b3e809b096) | fix | Respect OnPush change detection strategy for dynamically created components ([#&#8203;51356](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51356)) |\n| [88a0af64fd](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/88a0af64fde58cbf71e8e2a22c39fabb8f0ee8fb) | perf | generate arrow functions for pure function calls ([#&#8203;51668](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51668)) |\n\n##### router\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [f464e39364](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f464e39364da6436fc4b5a703f66fe7dee70818c) | fix | Ensure title observable gets latest values ([#&#8203;51561](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51561)) |\n| [b2aff43621](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b2aff4362129feb746856fc3d0f8e73b1927a037) | fix | Remove `urlHandlingStrategy` from public Router properties ([#&#8203;51631](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51631)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0-next.2`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next2-metal-monkey-2023-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/17.0.0-next.1...17.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### multiple\n\n-   -   Themes are now more strictly validated when calling Angular Material\n        theme mixins.

the functionality currently supported by the `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` module.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we would like the ability to add custom middlewares to the dev server. In our case, this would be used to inject a connect-compatible middleware that acts as a means of providing authenticated access to proxied endpoints, by setting session cookies used for authorization.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nVite's dev server currently supports proxy endpoints via an embedded `http-proxy` module, and provides documentation on [customizing with additional middlewares](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-proxy):\r\n\r\n> In some cases, you might also want to configure the underlying dev server (e.g. to add custom middlewares to the internal [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) app). In order to do that, you need to write your own [plugin](https://vitejs.dev/guide/using-plugins) and use [configureServer](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin#configureserver) function.\r\n\r\nThe `configureServer` method exposes the custom middleware hook:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst myPlugin = () => ({\r\n  name: 'configure-server',\r\n  configureServer(server) {\r\n    server.middlewares.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n      // custom handle request...\r\n    })\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nExposing direct access to the Vite API may not align with the philosophy of the Angular CLI, but supporting the extensibility via custom builders would make these use cases feasible.\r\n\r\nI see similar requests in other issues such as https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24163 and https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/issues/1288\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I'm very excited to see CLI's build process move over to Vite; I've been using it outside Angular, and have given talks about how much I've enjoyed it: https://steele.blue/vite-is-neat/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"vite - Expose ability to add middlewares to Vite dev server (or similar extensibility)\" (#25777)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1886659561","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-07T22:54:46","Actor":"philmayfield","Number":"27775","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelectionList): Spacing too large between checkbox / radio when set to togglePosition=\"before\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15\n\n### Description\n\nUsing a `<mat-selection-list>` component, and setting the options with `<mat-list-option togglePosition=\"before\">` results in too much space between the toggle and the content.

Single toggle button instances are meeting accessibility requirements because they have a change in text or icon in addition to color.\r\n\r\nSee WCAG context below:\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): “This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast.” \r\nThis success criterion is met, but is only applicable to the default (un-selected) state.\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\nThis is not being met. \r\n\r\nWCAG [Use of color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color): If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue, but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.\r\nThis implies that a design solution that meets 3:1 contrast is sufficient in meeting the “Use of Color” success criterion.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the component demo and does not require StackBlitz: https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe contrast ratio of the selected state must meet at least 3:1 to fulfill WCAG success criterion for non-text contrast and use of color.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCurrently the selected state of mat-button-toggle-group uses a fill color of #E0E0E0. On an #FFFFFF background, the contrast ratio is only 1.32:1. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular/Material 16.2.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button-toggle-group): Accessibility issue of WCAG non-text contrast and WCAG use of color\" (#27748)"},{"Id":"1875065745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T15:10:20","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27746","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: omit repetitions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27746","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: omit repetitions\" (#27746)"},{"Id":"1875320398","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T11:15:53","Actor":"omerman","Number":"27747","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using BreakpointObserver to set behaviors(props/style) to components it will often flicker on first reload especially once the window loads for the first time / when using ssr.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that using media queries for example will look perfect vs using BreakpointObserver to achieve the same things.\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to deal with that?\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\n\r\n(If it looks like Im coming too strong, it's because it is frustrating, but really I do appreciate the hard work given on this framework)\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. generate this example on an angular project `ng generate @angular/material:navigation <component-name>`\r\n2. open browser with 400px size(width)\r\n3. refresh the example\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf you hide/show the relevant components using media query, it will just work. no flicker.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to just work smoothly, and if it's a caveat I would expect some sort of implemented behavior/way to help us overcome this. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nYou will see the component of the sidenav flicker for a second.\r\nAlso the simple nav button  will flicker\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: latest\r\n- CDK/Material: latest\r\n- Browser(s): chrome latest\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27747","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic\" (#27747)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-09-08T03:30:03.1559128Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2055}

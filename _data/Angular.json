Given that the default is `implements OnInit`, this leads to unnecessary post-editing (removing `OnInit`, or adding other hooks by hand). As you gain experience in angular, you are able to tell beforehand which hooks you're gonna need before you issue `ng g c`, but the CLI doesn't give you a way to fine-tune the generated code at the command level.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `--hooks` flag, taking a piped string of hooks to implement, or a specific constant to include none. Examples:\r\n\r\n`ng g c mycomp --hooks none` = `ng g c mycomp -h` \r\n`ng g c mycomp --hooks OnInit|OnDestroy|AfterViewInit`\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- provides a \"compositional\" granular opt-in model (as opposed to `--skip*` model which presumes existing defaults)\r\n- scalable (same syntax could also apply to directives, services, eg. `ng g s myserv --hooks OnDestroy`)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- not a fast-track solution\r\n\r\nHaving a flag to control the `implements` part would allow user to create custom scripts to follow the smart/dumb paradigm in their workflow, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nng g c --hooks OnInit|OnDestroy|AfterViewInit -s false\r\n   // usage: npm run csmart -- mycomp (= create mycomp, specified hooks, styles in ext file)\r\n\r\nng g c --hooks -c OnPush -s true\r\n   // usage: npm run cdumb -- mycomp  (= create mycomp, no hooks, CD OnPush, inline style)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nI would gladly hear of one if exists.\r\n\r\nOf course, the suggested flag `--hooks` (alias `-h`) is just an example - you might choose a different wording, such as `--implements`, however `implements` could suggest that user's custom or 3rd party interfaces/classes could be implemented too, while the option we discuss pertains to Angular lifecycle hooks only\r\n\r\nA fast-track solution would be to provide `--skipOnInit` flag, but this is a non-scalable solution which I don't want to promote here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18771","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"generate component: Add an option to fine-tune the inclusion of lifecycle hooks\" (#18771)"},{"Id":"700061775","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-12T05:04:13","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18768","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular packages","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`0d66286` -> `5cbdec4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fanimations//) |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`0435b16` -> `4442df3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk//) |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`6a03b34` -> `fee7379`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcommon//) |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`c3d6d68` -> `a3def10`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcompiler//) |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`c6c9e63` -> `51bc39a`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcompiler-cli//) |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`66351bb` -> `0a9e280`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcore//) |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`8264bdb` -> `f805879`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fforms//) |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`f327fda` -> `8587b36`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2flanguage-service//) |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`14c196e` -> `5dff85f`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2flocalize//) |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material2-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`ee55bc9` -> `8c8427f`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial//) |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`bcec19b` -> `0d2241a`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial-moment-adapter//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`0e453d3` -> `8e66932`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-browser//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`2632924` -> `579ef96`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-browser-dynamic//) |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`3a8ca4f` -> `eeb46f2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-server//) |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`722d9b8` -> `2d3dcf3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2frouter//) |\n\n:abcd: If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A new project created in version 9.1 does not have this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nI created a new project today using the following:\r\n\r\n    ng new testapp --packageManager=yarn --skipGit=true --routing=true --style=scss\r\n    ng generate module test --module=app --routing --route=test\r\n    (then I emptied app.component.html and added <router-outlet></router-outlet>)\r\n    ng build\r\n\r\nWhen I visit the /test route in the _latest_ Firefox or Chrome, the developer console shows the error below. Running from the webpack dev server does not exhibit the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is strange, but I determined that the problem goes away after editing .browserslistrc to change \"last 1 Chrome version\" to \"last 25 Chrome versions\". Today this equates to Chrome versions 60-85. Using 'last 1' thru 24 all fail. It's also fixed by adding \"> 0.5%\". This existed in a new install with Angular 9. It seems this equates to just Chrome versions 83-85. Adding \"maintained node versions\" also prevents the error.\r\n\r\nSorry ahead of time. I'm aware this could be all my fault or maybe a bug in the browserslist library. Just seems like a brand new install would be fine and it took a long time to track down. I checked similar lazy-load examples in the tutorials and they work, but the Stackblitz projects I reviewed didn't have a browserslist file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nhttps://github.com/davehasagithub/ngtemp\r\n\r\nFirst commit was from ng new, second from ng generate plus an updated app.component.html--that's it!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: _angular_core__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.…µ…µdefineComponent is not a function\r\nTypeError: _angular_core__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.…µ…µdefineComponent is not a function\r\n    at Module.K9yR (test.component.ts:8)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:84)\r\n    at Module.NBQd (test-routing.module.ts:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:84)\r\n    at Module.FScs (test.module.ts:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:84)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone-evergreen.js:364)\r\n    at Object.onInvoke (core.js:27431)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone-evergreen.js:363)\r\n    at Zone.run (zone-evergreen.js:123)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:798)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:750)\r\n    at zone-evergreen.js:860\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:399)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:27419)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:398)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone-evergreen.js:167)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone-evergreen.js:569)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 10.1.1\r\nNode: 14.10.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1001.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1001.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1001.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1001.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1001.1\r\nrxjs                              6.6.3\r\ntypescript                        4.0.2\r\nwebpack                           4.44.1</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Let me explain it through an example -\r\nI am making some changes to my css/html file. Everytime I edit my file and view the changes in my browser. The changes in the code are very few, so it wont take much time for cli to build the app. So as soon as i made the changes, they got reflected. Now if I switch to my terminal to view the status of my build, it will be somewhat inconvenient for me to figure out if my code got build or not, because there are a lot of other build logs too.\r\n\r\nAnother point here is that the console log contains date field which is too detailed and serves a different purpose.\r\nThere should be some easy way to track when this build happened.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nWe can add some details like - Served xx seconds/minutes/hours ago either for the most recent build or all builds.\r\nI am attaching a screenshot of current log along with the expected.\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61384771/92922634-c4d55680-f453-11ea-9ad3-c2f178c8ead3.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18762","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build Timing addition in build logs\" (#18762)"},{"Id":"699248231","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-11T13:01:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18763","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): print build date in locale string","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #18762","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18763","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): print build date in locale string\" (#18763)"},{"Id":"698855085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-11T11:31:59","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"18755","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser to version 5.3.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.3.0` -> `5.3.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.3.0/5.3.1) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.3.0` -> `5.3.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.3.0/5.3.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser</summary>\n\n### [`v5.3.1`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v531)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1)\n\n-   An issue with destructuring declarations when `pure_getters` is enabled has been fixed\n-   Fixed a crash when chain expressions need to be shallowly compared\n-   Made inlining functions more conservative to make sure a function that contains a reference to itself isn't moved into a place that can create multiple instances of itself.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

All our modules are upgraded to use the new way of tsconfig: tsconfig.base.json, tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.json. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nTry to create a new library with\r\n`ng g library`\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nCannot read property 'paths' of undefined\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.0\r\nNode: 12.18.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1001.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1001.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1001.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1001.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                      10.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular               10.1.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.1001.0\r\nrxjs                              6.6.3\r\ntypescript                        4.0.2\r\nwebpack                           4.44.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

both components inside one `cdkDropList`. I also can move from on to another `cdkDropList`. But if I try to move it back to first `cdkDropList` or move it inside the new `cdkDropList`, an error occurs. If I debug the `$event` the `event.previousContainer.id` is still `0`. So something wasn't updated. But I don't know what.\r\n\r\nI know there are way's to write it shorter but before starting refactoring I need a working drag and drop.\r\n\r\nStackBlitz: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-iuwvmb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-iuwvmb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce in Stackblitz:\r\n1.

I determined that it was because by parent component was standalone and importing the child components directly. I did eventually get this working by using the `overrideComponent` method, however the docs made it seem like that wasn't needed in this case.\r\n\r\nThere is [a later section](https://angular.dev/guide/testing/components-scenarios#override-component-providers) all about the needed method, so I think that the nested component tests section should mention that this might be necessary and link to the later section for the full details. \r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/testing/components-scenarios#nested-component-tests\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nI was looking for the preferred way to do shallowing testing of standalone components.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nI implemented stub components like the angular.dev page example and used them in `configureTestingModule` rather than `overrideComponent`. This led to the tests breaking due to missing providers needed in the child components. The error message itself wasn't helpful as I thought that following the example this way would replace the real component with the stub versions and I was at a loss as to why that wasn't working.\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\nI want the page to be updated to describe when and why it is necessary to use stubs in `configureTestingModule` vs `overrideComponent`\r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information

This change added a `share` to the `isStable` observable, which prevents additional subscribers from getting a value until a new one emits. One solution to the problem would be `shareReplay(1)`. However, that would increase the bundle size since we do not use `shareReplay` elsewhere. Instead, we don't even really need to share the observable.\r\n\r\nThe `Observable` available in `ApplicationRef.isStable` before the above commit was the zone stable observable, without a `share`. The new behavior adds only an additional observable to the stream, `hasPendingTasks` (a `BehaviorSubject`). The observables in this stream are not expensive to subscribe to. The only one with side effects is the `isStable` (because it subscirbes to onStable), but that one already has the `share` operator on it.

Since the dev sources are compiled in local mode, then this requires local compilation to generate extra imports which imply the ones generated in full compilation mode due to resolving component's dependencies. \r\n\r\nA new g3 specific option `generateExtraImportsInLocalMode` is added, which when is set and the compilation mode is local the compiler will generate extra imports. \r\n\r\nThe extra imports are generated in a way that the the prod sources can be bundled based on these extra imports plus user written imports without issue. This requires to perform static analysis as much as possible in local mode to resolve the component dependencies that are within the same target. For this to happen it is assumed that we are using local compilation mode per target, and not when per single (which is the case in g3). For external deps, we spread all external imports that could be candidate for exposing an external dependency to all the all the files in the compilation unit.\r\n\r\nTGP when local compilation mode is enabled for dev sources plus this change: [link]()\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

We serve several CSS \"theme\" files that are swappable, and need to be loaded dynamically by our theme utility (meaning: served externally from the Angular application bundle).

With Vite this option is completely gone. In bigger setups with lots of libraries and Cypress/Jest tests residing in the folder of each library, the app gets rebuilt every time an irrelevant file (i.e. `my-test.e2e.spec.ts`, `my-test.spec.ts` or `my-test.cy.ts`) was changed.\r\n\r\nEspecially creating and editing Cypress tests becomes a real an absolute struggle because you have to wait for the build to be completed before you can run a test properly.\r\n\r\nWhat I also find strange is this line: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.ts#L483\r\n\r\nSo where is the actual \"watching\" done, if not by Vite itself?

This is accomplished by adding an additional namesapce to the token map per color variant.

The mixin will then merge any overrides from the variant namespace into the default values from the standard namespace to determine the final value for each CSS variable. Note that the user must provide this a keyword argument, not a positional argument. This makes the API easier to maintain should we need to add other options later.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the necessary infrastructure for color variants, this PR also builds out the color variant supprot for mat-icon to prove out the infrstructure and serve as an example.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28279","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): Add support for color variants\" (#28279)"},{"Id":"2039218070","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:40:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28273","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides","State":"closed","Body":"**Note:** this is a resubmit of #28249.\r\n\r\nSwitches the custom density implementation of the form field to be based on tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28273","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides\" (#28273)"},{"Id":"2040570958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:37:20","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28278","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28278","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.3\" with changelog.\" (#28278)"},{"Id":"2040560630","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:26:40","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28277","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28277","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.4 release\" (#28277)"},{"Id":"2040544755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T22:23:42","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28276","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28276","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.4\" with changelog.\" (#28276)"},{"Id":"2040260199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T18:31:41","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28275","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): update inactive input width on value change","State":"open","Body":"* fixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28206","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28275","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): update inactive input width on value change\" (#28275)"},{"Id":"2040255258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T18:27:58","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"28274","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): failing color contrast text to bg color ratio","State":"open","Body":"\r\nRemoves :hover and .mat-focused opacity changes to .form-field-focus-overlay \r\nwhich was causing a low color contrast ratio between the text and form-field input\r\nbackground fill color.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28274","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/form-field): failing color contrast text to bg color ratio\" (#28274)"},{"Id":"2038461172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-13T17:49:53","Actor":"incy-tron","Number":"28270","RawContent":null,"Title":"SnackBar no longer supports panelClass","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAngular 14.\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/26928#issuecomment-1533422940\r\nResponding to closing of the referenced issue, which indicates \"... we generally don't support style overrides like this\".

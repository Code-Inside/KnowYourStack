This one has more permissive language and warns about **over-**using it. Yet, it doesn't explain when it's appropriate to use it, so overall it discourages developers from using it in unit tests, again.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the justification it provides is \"it disables compile-time checks\".

So `opera_mobile` target was renamed to **`opera-android`**.\n    -   `android` target name is also confusing for someone - that means Android WebView, some think thinks that it's Chrome for Android, but they have some differences. For avoiding confusion, added **`chrome-android`** target.\n    -   For consistency with two previous cases, added **`firefox-android`** target.\n    -   For avoiding breaking changes, the `oculus` and `opera_mobile` fields are available in the compat data till the next major release.\n-   Compat data improvements:\n    -

That mean that if the output contains, for example, `es.object.has-own`, the legacy reference to it, `esnext.object.has-own`, no longer added.\n    -   Aligned modules filters of [`core-js-builder`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-builder) and [`core-js-compat`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-compat), now it's `modules` and `exclude` options\n    -   Added support of entry points, modules, regexes, and arrays of them to those filters\n    -   Missed `targets` option of `core-js-compat` means that the `targets` filter just will not be applied, so the result will contain modules required for all possible engines\n-   Compat data:\n    -

For example, overload 15 of HttpClient.get() returns `Observable<T>` with T being the requested type of the JSON parsed response. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is more to an Observable contract that is of interest to the API user:\r\n\r\n* does it eventually complete?\r\n* how many values are emitted before completion?\r\n* when exactly does it emit?\r\n* Is it a \"cold\" or \"hot\" Observable - i.e., do I trigger a side effect like with HttpClient on each subscription?\r\n* Do I get the latest value on subscription (as is the case with [ActivatedRoute](https://angular.io/api/router/ActivatedRoute).params) or do I only get new events (like [AbstractControl.valueChanges](https://angular.io/api/forms/AbstractControl#valueChanges))?\r\n* What is the type of error? (`HttpErrorResponse` in case of `HttpClient`)\r\n* Does something special happen when you unsubscribe?\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nIt would be helpful to have every documented `Observable` return value in the Angular API to answer these questions in a structured, uniform way in the API docs. `AbstractControl.valueChanges` is a positive example of that:\r\n\r\n> A multicasting observable that emits an event every time the value of the control changes, in the UI or programmatically. It also emits an event each time you call enable() or disable() without passing along {emitEvent: false} as a function argument.\r\n\r\nAn example for above overload of `HttpClient.get` could be:\r\n\r\n> An `Observable` that dispatches a new HTTP request on each subscription. If successful, emits the response body parsed as JSON, then completes. In case of an error, signals an error of type [HttpErrorResponse](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpErrorResponse). Cancels the request on unsubscribe.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\nThis issue is related to #46542 , but not exclusively about the HTTP service. Rather, like @Tomassito [commented](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46542#issuecomment-1214223880), it is a general issue with Observables provided by Angular:\r\n\r\n> Yes, there should be definitely more information on what to expect from the observables exposed by angular services, especially the httpClient. Do docs even mention the fact that an http request auto completes?\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49246","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: Document the properties of Angular-returned Observables in the API docs\" (#49246)"},{"Id":"1602221209","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-28T01:31:22","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"49241","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Clean up `getNgZone` implementation.","State":"open","Body":"The current implementation is a bit confusing to read.

The unit tests run can run in either Chrome or jsdom. I need jsdom because my CI environment doesn't have Chrome (org policy: no browsers on servers).\r\n\r\nAngular CLI 15.1.4 introduced a change in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24620 wherein Javascript bundles are loaded as modules. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, jsdom doesn't support <script type=\"module\">; it simply doesn't load the module scripts. This is a known issue in jsdom - https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2475\r\n\r\nIdeally jsdom would add module support; but since that ticket has been open for four years, I'm not holding out much hope. So instead, here's my request:\r\n\r\n**REQUEST:** Could Angular CLI add a flag to add/omit type=\"module\" ?\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is patching jsdom (using patch-package) to ignore the type attribute on <script type=\"module\">.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nClone my git repo: https://github.com/andrewpmontgomery/angular-15-jsdom\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n2. Run `npm run test:chrome` and all three tests should pass.\r\n3. Run `npm run test:jsdom` and it should time-out.\r\n4. Run `npm run patch-package`\r\n5.

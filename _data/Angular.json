This would be helpful for devs to identify which component instance is slow for situations where there are multiple instances and only one is actually causing performance issues.\n\nThis would likely require us to define a route in Angular DevTools and support deep linking to a specific component ID, then creating a deep link to that route with the relevant component ID.\n\nI don't think we really have a stable component ID which would be useful for this mechanism (we have component IDs, but they're more like component _class_ IDs, not component _instance_ IDs). So we'd probably need to create a monotonic counter managed as part of the debug setup and communicated to Angular DevTools.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe could attempt to link to the host element in the browser DevTools Elements Panel, which would not require Angular DevTools to be installed. I'm not sure if it's possible to do that today and might be a good fallback behavior and/or second deep link to include?\n\nThere's also potentially other use cases for deep linking like redirecting to Angular DevTools Profiler Panel, but I suspect that would be a bit harder to actually land and probably not provide much additional context to users.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63960","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deep Link Performance Panel to Component in Angular DevTools\" (#63960)"},{"Id":"3435993465","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-19T21:46:15","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"63959","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link Performance Panel Custom Track to Angular Docs","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nChrome Canary in v141 is shipping support for links in the performance panel custom track details.\n\n<img width=\"1364\" height=\"1312\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f425ff5-5084-4eb6-856d-99bf36bd7a25\" />\n\nAdded in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/6819859.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI think this would be a good opportunity to link to relevant Angular docs for each mark such as [`ngOnInit`](https://angular.dev/guide/components/lifecycle#ngoninit).

optional/conditional","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently i have noticed that only `required()` validator is optional using {when: () => {}} option. \n\nImagine situation when you have form for model.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Interface describing editation data of marker arg\n */\nexport interface MarkerArgEdit\n{\n    /**\n     * Code of marker\n     */\n    kod: string|undefined|null;\n\n    /**\n     * Value of marker\n     */\n    hodnota: string|number|undefined|null;\n}\n```\n\nYou have control for `kod`, which is select (combo box), according selected value of `kod` you will change type of input for `hodnota`. It can be number input, string input or select (combo box) with available string values. \n\nThis means that validation for `hodnota` can differ according selected value in `kod`. So it means that i would like to have schema like this:\n\n```\nmin(path.hodnota, () => some logic, {when: () => this.kodObj().type == 'INT'});\nmax(path.hodnota, () => some logic, {when: () => this.kodObj().type == 'INT'});\npattern(path.hodnota, () => some logic, {when: () => this.kodObj().type == 'STRING'});\n```\n\nThis is currently impossible since only `required` validator can be optional.\n\nThere is also problem with *typings* as you can see here https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63789, so maybe some casting (type narrowing) would be also nice, because `min` allows only `number` and `pattern` allows only `string` but hodnota is `string|number`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMove `{when?: NoInfer<LogicFn<TValue, boolean, TPathKind>}` into `BaseValidatorConfig` so all validators can be optional.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently no other alternative comes into my mind.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63932","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make all signal forms validator optional/conditional\" (#63932)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3436240718","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-19T23:52:39","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31256","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): make ai-tutor description LLM-centric","State":"open","Body":"The previous description for the `ai_tutor` MCP tool was written from a user-centric perspective.

[`v0.25.10`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#02510)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.9...v0.25.10)\n\n- Fix a panic in a minification edge case ([#&#8203;4287](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4287))\n\n  This release fixes a panic due to a null pointer that could happen when esbuild inlines a doubly-nested identity function and the final result is empty. It was fixed by emitting the value `undefined` in this case, which avoids the panic. This case must be rare since it hasn't come up until now. Here is an example of code that previously triggered the panic (which only happened when minifying):\n\n  ```js\n  function identity(x) { return x }\n  identity({ y: identity(123) })\n  ```\n\n- Fix `@supports` nested inside pseudo-element ([#&#8203;4265](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4265))\n\n  When transforming nested CSS to non-nested CSS, esbuild is supposed to filter out pseudo-elements such as `::placeholder` for correctness. The [CSS nesting specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) says the following:\n\n  > The nesting selector cannot represent pseudo-elements (identical to the behavior of the ':is()' pseudo-class). We’d like to relax this restriction, but need to do so simultaneously for both ':is()' and '&', since they’re intentionally built on the same underlying mechanisms.\n\n  However, it seems like this behavior is different for nested at-rules such as `@supports`, which do work with pseudo-elements. So this release modifies esbuild's behavior to now take that into account:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  ::placeholder {\n    color: red;\n    body & { color: green }\n    @&#8203;supports (color: blue) { color: blue }\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n  ::placeholder {\n    color: red;\n  }\n  body :is() {\n    color: green;\n  }\n  @&#8203;supports (color: blue) {\n     {\n      color: blue;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n  ::placeholder {\n    color: red;\n  }\n  body :is() {\n    color: green;\n  }\n  @&#8203;supports (color: blue) {\n    ::placeholder {\n      color: blue;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote (pacote)</summary>\n\n### [`v21.0.3`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2103-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/compare/v21.0.2...v21.0.3)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n- [`eed1bd5`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/commit/eed1bd52ea803bf075a81d3786c5240856aed9bf) [#&#8203;431](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/pull/431) `@npmcli/git@7.0.0` ([#&#8203;431](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/issues/431))\n\n### [`v21.0.2`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2102-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/compare/v21.0.1...v21.0.2)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n- [`32cb6d1`](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/commit/32cb6d13bb0ef38473a1660329076b73bf4e2dea) [#&#8203;429](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/pull/429) `npm-pick-manifest@11.0.1` ([#&#8203;429](https://redirect.github.com/npm/pacote/issues/429))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.1.6`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small-716-2025-09-18-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v7.1.5...v7.1.6)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n- **deps:** update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;20773](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20773)) ([88af2ae](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/88af2ae7df77160e7d11a9fa147a4967c8499f13))\n- **esbuild:** inject esbuild helper functions with minified `$` variables correctly ([#&#8203;20761](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20761)) ([7e8e004](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/7e8e0043d60379e11da481d9cc3c3556c9756ac0))\n- fallback terser to main thread when nameCache is provided ([#&#8203;20750](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20750)) ([a679a64](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/a679a643404c95556dda2670643e14eca9c585bd))\n- **types:** strict env typings fail when `skipLibCheck` is `false` ([#&#8203;20755](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20755)) ([cc54e29](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/cc54e294746d3eac868de96f85d98dd0fa0cda11))\n\n##### Miscellaneous Chores\n\n- **deps:** update rolldown-related dependencies ([#&#8203;20675](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20675)) ([a67bb5f](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/a67bb5fbec5f3e42151dc7e3166858d0d33533de))\n- **deps:** update rolldown-related dependencies ([#&#8203;20772](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20772)) ([d785e72](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/d785e72f2ead705e8b2416c0a5097878fced3435))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>colinhacks/zod (zod)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.9`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/releases/tag/v4.1.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/compare/v4.1.8...v4.1.9)\n\n#### Commits:\n\n- [`a78716d`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/a78716d91da7649a61016b81c27f49fd9e79a81e) Update zshy ([#&#8203;5249](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/5249))\n- [`923af80`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/923af801fde9f033cfd7e0e753b421a554fe3be8) Publish zod\\@&#8203;4.1.9\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v21.0.0-next.4`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next4-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/21.0.0-next.3...21.0.0-next.4)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n- `ngComponentOutletContent` is now of type `Node[][] | undefined` instead of `any[][] | undefined`.\n\n##### core\n\n- Using a combination of `provideZoneChangeDetection`\n  while also removing ZoneJS polyfills will no longer result in the\n  internal scheduler being disabled. All Angular applications now\n  consistenly use the same scheduler, and those with the Zone change detection\n  provider include additional automatic scheduling behaviors based on\n  NgZone stabilization.\n- Angular no longer provides a change detection scheduler\n  for ZoneJS-based change detection by default. Add\n  `provideZoneChangeDetection` to the providers of your\n  `bootstrapApplication` function or your `AppModule` (if using\n  `bootstrapModule`). This provider addition will be covered by an\n  automated migration.\n- `moduleId` was removed from `Component` metadata.\n- The `interpolation` option on Components has been removed.

[`v21.0.0-next.4`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next4-2025-09-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/21.0.0-next.3...21.0.0-next.4)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n- `ngComponentOutletContent` is now of type `Node[][] | undefined` instead of `any[][] | undefined`.\n\n##### core\n\n- Using a combination of `provideZoneChangeDetection`\n  while also removing ZoneJS polyfills will no longer result in the\n  internal scheduler being disabled. All Angular applications now\n  consistenly use the same scheduler, and those with the Zone change detection\n  provider include additional automatic scheduling behaviors based on\n  NgZone stabilization.\n- Angular no longer provides a change detection scheduler\n  for ZoneJS-based change detection by default. Add\n  `provideZoneChangeDetection` to the providers of your\n  `bootstrapApplication` function or your `AppModule` (if using\n  `bootstrapModule`). This provider addition will be covered by an\n  automated migration.\n- `moduleId` was removed from `Component` metadata.\n- The `interpolation` option on Components has been removed. Only the default `{{ ... }}` is now supported.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [7a4b225c57](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a4b225c57d8e390ec06731f5211d52d14da3a9c) | refactor | improve typing of `ngComponentOutletContent` ([#&#8203;63674](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63674)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [803dc8e44c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/803dc8e44c047ebccdfa5ce9ce6a450c6971a78b) | fix  | Add support for `aria-invalid` ([#&#8203;63748](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63748)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type | Description                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [89cf62f907](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/89cf62f907d28684d726d26fa4f12be23e8152ff) | fix  | only bind inputs that are part of microsyntax to a structural directive ([#&#8203;52453](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/52453))       |\n| [7fd3db0423](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7fd3db04232d63f1b48ec389bbb62d9ca277fcf9) | fix  | remove internal syntax-related flags ([#&#8203;63787](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63787))                                          |\n| [0a60e355e1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/0a60e355e1563051f1152efd46fe6a7daa3e5951) | fix  | signal not invoked diagnostic not raised when input has same name in template ([#&#8203;63754](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/63754)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit                                                                                           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [809a4ed8c1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/809a4ed8c110ca930cb1c6bad309f8bfcaf7ceb8) | feat     | Add migration for zoneless by default.

So I tried to add typing like so:\n\n```ts\nthis.dialog.open<MyDialog, MyDialogData, MyDialogResult>(\n  MyDialog,\n  {\n    closePredicate: (\n      result: MyDialogResult | undefined,\n      config: MatDialogConfig<MyDialogData>,\n      componentInstance: MyDialog | null\n    ) => {\n      return componentInstance?.animal() !== 'my original data';\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThat also fail to compile. And I am out of ideas.\n\nAngular Material source never use this callback with any parameters (neither in implementation, nor in tests).\n\nWhat is the expected usage pattern here ? Is there a way to avoid repetition ?\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nStackblitz does not compile\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1\n- CDK/Material: 20.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- TypeScript: 5.8.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31873","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): Typing of new `MatDialogConfig.closePredicate`\" (#31873)"},{"Id":"3419668249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T22:06:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31872","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox","State":"open","Body":"* Create the Combobox UI Pattern class\r\n* Create the CdkCombobox, CdkComboboxInput, CdkComboboxPopupContent, and CdkComboboxPopup directives\r\n* Create 3 component examples.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31872","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox\" (#31872)"},{"Id":"3418265211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T14:37:40","Actor":"BUONJG","Number":"31871","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CdkTextareaAutosize): Textarea does not scroll to active line","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\n\nIs there currently a solution or planned fix for this issue?\n\nAs described in [issue 30841](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30841)\n, when using the textarea with cdkTextareaAutosize, the component does not automatically scroll to keep the cursor in view once the content exceeds the maxRows. This makes the textarea very difficult to use.\n\nThe problem occurs on Google Chrome (but not in Firefox).\n\nIt appeared starting from Angular Material v19.\n\nIn v18, the behavior was correct: https://v18.material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nFrom v19 up to the current version, the bug is reproducible in Chrome: https://material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nThank you for your help and clarification.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ozyjlswf?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftext-field-autosize-textarea-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\nUsing google Chrome:\n1. start typing in the textarea (add lines pressing enter)\n2. when more that 5 lines are added, cursor deapear and we are typing in the hidden part of the textarea (we don't see what we are typing anymore)\n\nDo the same on Firefox:\n- the textarea scrolls automatically to active line\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe textarea does not scroll automatically to the active line on google chrome\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe textarea should scroll automatically to the active line on all nagigators\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20\n- CDK/Material: 20\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkTextareaAutosize): Textarea does not scroll to active line\" (#31871)"},{"Id":"3418122357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T14:04:01","Actor":"rsi21","Number":"31870","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): For some locales, the format used on display is not matching the short date format","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello, \n\nWe use the Material date picker to fill several dates and then display them with 'shortDate' pipe.\nWe also work/switch with from several locales, and we notice some inconsistencies for some of them:\n\n- de-DE\n\n<img width=\"348\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccd7f65-e399-489b-b76a-c95f998d76f5\" />\n\n- nl-NL\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69962e5-701e-495a-8564-83ab62439a29\" />\n\nIf we look at fr-FR for example, the display is correct and consistent:\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1462c799-e111-403b-8519-88ad1f84a061\" />\n\nI know CDRL is used behind the scene for locale management here, but as datePicker and shortDate are both provided by Angular, i suspect more an inconstentcy between both components.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use a sample angular 20 application, and declare provideNativeDateAdapter()\n2. Use natively the DatePicker component to select the date\n3. Use the shortDate pipe to display the select date with the datepicker\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nConsistent display between datePicker and shortDate pipe format.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n<img width=\"348\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccd7f65-e399-489b-b76a-c95f998d76f5\" />\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Wndows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31870","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): For some locales, the format used on display is not matching the short date format\" (#31870)"},{"Id":"3417578461","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T11:40:22","Actor":"PriyankaSPX","Number":"31869","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelect): arrow-transform override does not work if component has no label","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFor a MatSelect without a MatLabel present, the select override `--mat-select-arrow-transform` is not applied, as the CSS transform field is overridden by `transform: none`.\n\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/8m8x9LWnqXgGJyW\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-ehh29ebf?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

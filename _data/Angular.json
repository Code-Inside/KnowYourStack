Previously, such template guards could only be methods, of which an\r\ninvocation would be inserted into the type-check block (TCB). For `NgIf`,\r\nthe template guard narrowed the type of its expression to be `NonNullable`\r\nusing the following declaration:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport declare class NgIf {\r\n  static ngTemplateGuard_ngIf<E>(dir: NgIf, expr: E): expr is NonNullable<E>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine for usages such as `*ngIf=\"person\"` but starts to introduce\r\nfalse-positives when e.g. an explicit non-null check like\r\n`*ngIf=\"person !== null\"` is used, as the method invocation in the TCB\r\nwould not have the desired effect of narrowing `person` to become\r\nnon-nullable:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nif (NgIf.ngTemplateGuard_ngIf(directive, ctx.person !== null)) {\r\n  // Usages of `ctx.person` within this block would\r\n  // not have been narrowed to be non-nullable.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new strategy for template guards to allow for the\r\nbinding expression itself to be used as template guard in the TCB. Now,\r\nthe TCB generated for `*ngIf=\"person !== null\"` would look as follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nif (ctx.person !== null) {\r\n  // This time `ctx.person` will successfully have\r\n  // been narrowed to be non-nullable.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis strategy can be activated by declaring the template guard as a\r\nproperty declaration with `'binding'` as literal return type.\r\n\r\nSee #30235 for an example where this led to a false positive.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30248","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): more accurate type narrowing for `ngIf` directive\" (#30248)"},{"Id":"439786031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-02T21:00:17","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"30247","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): evaluate external declaration usages as dynamic","State":"open","Body":"Previously, ngtsc would fail to evaluate expressions that access properties\r\nfrom e.g. the `window` object.

The angular-cli creates the import of crisis-center module after the AppRoutingModule. This will be an issue for the code.\r\n\r\nWhen a **Wildcard route** is defined in the **AppRoutingModule**, the wildcard route will be matched before the child route in the crisis-center routing can be matched. This happens very often wenn using the angular-cli to added submodule with routing feature.\r\n\r\nThe natrual way of adding Wildcard route is in the AppRoutingModule, and then always place the AppRoutingModule after all submodule in the import array of the AppModule. The debugging of such error relating to the routes match due to the import placement order is very difficult.  Thus, i suggest to improve the original doc text to hightlight this issue to prevent error in coding and improve the readers understanding of the impact of the placement order in the imports array of the angular modules.  \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/router#import-crisis-center-module-into-the-appmodule-routes\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This change limits the loading to only the command being executed in the common case and a subset of commands in the event an alias is used.  The help command now loads all commands during its execution which is needed to gather command description information.  Further improvements are possible by only loading the necessary metadata instead of the execution code (and its dependencies) as well.\r\nThis change allows for savings of ~250ms per execution and reduces memory consumption by 10-20 MBs depending on the command.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nBefore -- `./node_modules/.bin/ng version  0.99s user 0.17s system 113% cpu 1.020 total`\r\nAfter -- `./node_modules/.bin/ng version  0.70s user 0.13s system 110% cpu 0.749 total`\r\n\r\nBefore -- `./node_modules/.bin/ng g c a  1.91s user 0.30s system 111% cpu 1.996 total`\r\nAfter --

Open `bug.module.ts` and enable the workaround by removing the comment form line 9 and line 16 and putting line 8 and line 15 in comment instead.\r\n4. Run `ng build --prod` again.\r\n5. Open the new `main.*.js` and search for `prop1` again.

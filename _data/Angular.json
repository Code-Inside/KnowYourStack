syntax:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"@schematics/angular/workspace/files/tslint.json\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\n\r\n`ng lint` and `tslint -p .` both fail with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load [...]/tslint.json: Could not find custom rule directory: node_modules/codelyzer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that relative paths in `rulesDirectory` are resolved from the location of the extended `tslint.json` inside `node_modules/`, rather than the `tslint.json` in my project's root.\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\n\r\nThe `tslint.json` template in `@schematics/angular` should just use module resolution (`\"rulesDirectory\": [\"codelyzer\"]`), this seems to work here without any issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13100","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[schematics/angular] Use module resolution for codelyzer in tslint.json\"

I have tried everything on the web to increase it's performance with luck. I used App Shell, Webpack and even changed my server to nginx to serve static content but it's the same. Also another problem that the page takes about 18 seconds to fully which is really huge. Although I am using i18n because the application it's multi language. When I used App shell, my TTFB decreased to 60 ms which is ideal but the probelm that the page only rendered in the static html for the homepage for the whole app. If i tried to analyze any route it will return the same html which will effect my SEO. I understand that I can use csr and google can index it but i don't want to target only google and can be indexed from any craweler.\r\nHowever, I tried using prerender instead of server side and it did it's magic and loaded the page very quickly but the problem that my web app is really huge have about 80k routes which is not logic. Although that I have a huge server that can store all of this but I thought that's would be stupid idea. Does anyone know any ideas to solve this situation. you will find below my website link and please let me know what do you think with this situation!!!\r\nwww.easyschools.org\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13098","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Universal ttfb to first byte is very slow and fully page load\" (#13098)"},{"Id":"386053903","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-30T06:21:25","Actor":"HazizKhan","Number":"13099","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve compiling again and again without any saving changes","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x ] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nWindows 10\r\n@angular/cli: 7.1.0\r\nnode: 8.9.4\r\nnpm: 5.6.0\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

outside of the options list should still trigger that event.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nOverlay is blocking the click events.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/select/examples.\r\n\r\nAfter clicking on a native example to show the options in the list, with the list still open, you can still click anywhere on the page.\r\nAfter clicking on a material example to show the options list, with the list still open, you must click once to close the list and then again to interact with another

experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nI am currently using Angular 7.1.1 and Material 7.1.0\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nSimilar to #9320, but not the same.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround which is very hacky and doesn't have hover effects when the panel is open.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MatSelect } from '@angular/material';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: ``\r\n})\r\nclass MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {\r\n

HTMLElement;\r\n          el.click();\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that just using ```this.selectComponent.overlayDir.hasBackdrop = false;``` makes the clicking and hovering work as expected, but then the panels never close.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Select: Overlay is blocking click events\"

If this list changes such that the active item is removed from the DOM, all the tabindexes in the list are -1 since `activeItem` still points to the destroyed instance. I can also think of a few other cases where having mismatched `activeItemIndex` and `activeItem` references could cause problems.\r\n\r\nNow I _could_ watch for changes on the `QueryList` myself, however the `FocusKeyManager` doesn't provide an interface for updating the active item without setting the focus. This is problematic if the list isn't currently focused and changing the active item would potentially steal focus away from an input field.

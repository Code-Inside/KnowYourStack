Before choosing it, moving to it or sticking with it, one needs to evaluate its quality / development status. Even if comparisons with alternatives may be ideal, having a rough idea of Angular's own quality would already help a lot._\r\n\r\nWhile Angular's ITS tracks lots of issues, unfortunately, the project is way too large to efficiently analyze even a small representative sample of its tens of thousands of issues. [The _Issues_ page](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues) shows a list with countless pages. As I write these lines, the one shown by default links to ticket #47905 , which at first sight may not even report an actual Angular issue. On the other hand, top actual issues like #45272 do not feature on that first page at all.\r\n\r\nBasically, the sort is random (newest tickets are listed first), and while other sorts are available, none really helps with evaluation.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBy far the best solution would start by migrating to a proper ITS engine. Most importantly, mature engines provide:\r\n\r\n- a way to set a (quite approximate) importance for each issue\r\n- tracking of ticket validity\r\n- tracking of issue resolution\r\n\r\nAtlassian Jira and JetBrains Youtrack are certainly the first options to evaluate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both of these are proprietary. Bugzilla is another option which is well ahead of GitHub, but - being written in Perl - may never reach maturity.\r\n\r\nOnce tickets have been migrated, triage of ideally all tickets is of course needed to take advantage of these new possibilities and enable more meaningful sorting and filtering.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAdding a page to the documentation treating Angular's status could also help. Such a page could link to the most important issues.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, GitHub provides a way to [\"pin\" a few issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository), allowing a most basic distinction between the very worst issues and... all the rest.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47914","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"No efficient way to evaluate quality/status\" (#47914)"},{"Id":"1427767690","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T20:04:52","Actor":"trekladyone","Number":"47913","RawContent":null,"Title":"New doc: Animation API summary","State":"open","Body":"Document extracted from the original Introduction document, which is to be retired.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47913","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"New doc: Animation API summary\" (#47913)"},{"Id":"1427755542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T19:53:49","Actor":"trekladyone","Number":"47912","RawContent":null,"Title":"New doc: Define animations and attach to an HTML template","State":"open","Body":"Document extracted from the original Introduction document, which is to be retired.

Is there any way to alter behavior of angular compiler? \r\n\r\nIn my project I have a case where we have `translate` directive, and sometimes we provide whole html code in its element body:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div translate>this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a></div>\r\n```\r\nthe issue is that such translation blocks may contain some invalid attributes or even directives - because of this we need to always add `ngNonBindable` in such cases. Recently we also found that sometimes our translation logic fails, as there might be some whitespaces trimmed by default. So we have to add another attribute: `ngPreserveWhitespaces` \r\n\r\nI was trying to add such attributes from `translate` directive level, but after studying angular compiler src, it is clear that it can not work, as these attributes are resolved during compilation time.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that would touch this subject, is that we would like to extract raw html template \"as is\" before it is compiled, and provide it in attribute like this:\r\n```\r\n<div translate pre-translation-data=\"this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a>\">this is some <a href=\"#\">link</a></div>\r\n```\r\nBeing able to do this would be huge help with translation of such texts because now we extract them from `nativeElement` which is not really fail-proof. \r\nIt would also open new way for our QA guys for locating certain elements in their E2E tests, without writing complicated CSS selectors.\r\n\r\nIf somebody could point me in right direction on how to achieve this, it would be huge help\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd possibility to use ngNonBindable and ngPreserveWhitespaces from directive level\r\nAdd possibility to access raw html template of directive/component child. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf such feature is already possible, please add some examples on documentation","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47905","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Looking for a way to access/modify angular template parser\" (#47905)"},{"Id":"1427245015","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T13:11:50","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"47904","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update example to reflect changes in Angular CLI version 15.","State":"open","Body":"These changes include:\r\n- Remove the usage of `enableProdMode`\r\n- Remove `test.ts`, `polyfills.ts`, `karma.conf.js` and environment files which are no longer generated by default\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47904","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update example to reflect changes in Angular CLI version 15.\" (#47904)"},{"Id":"1426236390","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T09:37:53","Actor":"trekladyone","Number":"47897","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animation transitions and triggers update","State":"closed","Body":"Linting corrections.

It is thus now possible for a downstream-app to override a component's base-implementation in a lib. According to the docs I read, all you have to do is declare the same `selector`. Unfortunately, though, the subclass requires `template` or `templateUrl` -- without it, I get this error:\r\n```\r\n error NG2001: component is missing a template\r\n```\r\nMy app-code doesn't have access to the lib's template-file (declared there via `templateUrl`) and IMHO I should not be forced to re-declare the template, if I do not want to replace it (but inherit it the way it is in the super-component).\r\n\r\nThe component-class contains the UI-logic.

It is not possible to my knowledge to have a different lifecycle, for example to have multiple stateful service-instances, each associated with a component.\r\n\r\nWhen declaring a service-provider on the component-level, this is possible with `@Host()`, but then it is impossible for downstream-projects to override the service-implementation-class in their modules. The provider declared in `@Component(...)` wins over any provider-declaration in any module.\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle should be independent from the type-declaration! It should be possible to somehow (e.g. using `@Host()`) declare a local instance of the service, but still use the type declared in the module's provider.\r\n\r\nBesides this concrete use-case, Angular should support custom scopes, just like Java's CDI does. With the current service-architecture in Angular (i.e. every service being either a singleton or not being overridable by downstream-projects), it is most often impossible to implement a stateful service.\r\n\r\nI also tried using a custom factory and access the `Injector`, but I saw in the debugger, that my factory is not consulted, if there is already a service-instance existing. I therefore cannot put the lookup-logic (of whether to reuse an existing instance or create a new instance for my current situation) into my own factory.\r\n\r\nIn Java's CDI, a current thread running can enter (and exit) custom scopes manually and access the proper injected service-instance having declared an active scope.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n1. Make `@Host()` work with services declared on the module-level. If a component declares `@Host()` it should get its own *instance* of the service, but the class-declaration should be taken from the module and thus still be overridable by a downstream-module. The child-components should automatically (or if needed with an additional `SkipSelf()`) use the service-instance of their parent-container (recursively). This would solve our immediate problem of not being able to associate a stateful service-instance with a component in a 1-1-relation.\r\n2. Introduce custom scopes just like Java's CDI does.\r\n3. A provider could -- additionally to the `useFactory` -- be declared with a newly introduced `useRegistry`. In contrast to the factory, the registry is consulted directly and it is up to the registry whether it wants to return an existing instance or create a new one. The registry-implementation needs access to the current injection-situation, of course. I'm not sure, but this may be possible via getting the current `Injector` as one of the `deps`. Since my factory wasn't consulted, if the instance already existed, I didn't analyse this further.\r\n4. Just in case, this is not yet possible: The injection-point should be accessible to the registry, just like in CDI (see `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint`).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI didn't find any alternative, but maybe I overlooked something. Please let me know, if I did!\r\n\r\nAs alternative, we could (and currently do) use stateless services, because the service-instances are singletons. With this approach they can be overridden (replaced by another implementation) downstream (the app might need another implementation than provided by default by the lib).\r\n\r\nStateless services suck for what we want to achieve. It's like writing a procedural language (e.g. C) -- but we like OO for a reason :smirk:\r\n\r\nDeclaring the service in `@Component` is not possible, because we then cannot override the service-implementation downstream.

In the issue described below, UI elements that are no longer used are not garbage collected when the Angular Browser Animation Module is imported in a multi-page Angular application in connection with Angular ShadowDom components. \r\n\r\n### Supposed bug of the Browser Animation module\r\nIn multi-page Angular applications which imports the Animation Module, the createRender method of the RenererFactory2 is called at every page change (call-stack: createComponent -> componentFactory.create -> rendererFactory.createRenderer) to create an animation renderer. This animation renderer contains the various information to be able to run animations.\r\n\r\nFor each component of a view to be created, the create Renderer method is called and it is checked whether a cutsom animation is set for the respective component or not. If this is the case, a custom renderer will be created (that will not get cached), otherwise a base renderer should be used. To do this, a delegate is created from the information of the respective component (see the next chapter for more information on how the delegate gets created) and it is checked whether a renderer has already been cached for such a component. If so, the renderer is returned from the cache, otherwise a new base renderer is created and saved.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// internal Angular code from the RendererFactory2: \r\ncreateRenderer(hostElement, type) {\r\n        const EMPTY_NAMESPACE_ID = '';\r\n        // cache the delegates to find out which cached delegate can\r\n        // be used by which cached renderer\r\n        const delegate = this.delegate.createRenderer(hostElement, type);\r\n        if (!hostElement || !type || !type.data || !type.data['animation']) {\r\n            let renderer = this._rendererCache.get(delegate);\r\n            if (!renderer) {\r\n                renderer = new BaseAnimationRenderer(EMPTY_NAMESPACE_ID, delegate, this.engine);\r\n                // only cache this result when the base renderer is used\r\n                this._rendererCache.set(delegate, renderer);\r\n            }\r\n            return renderer;\r\n        }\r\n        // else custom renderer...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs just described, the renderers of the Browser Animation Module are cached so that they can be returned when a previous page is called up again. However, the analysis has shown that caching sometimes does not work correctly, and a new renderer is always created for some components.\r\n\r\nThe cache is a simple map that keeps a delegate as a key and the renderer as a value. The delegate is created based on the respective component. I noticed in the applications I work on professionally that the components that lead to the re-creation of a renderer are themselves relatively small, which is why one could ask why this leads to the large detached elements and the memory problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that even a small component like a breadcrumb component holds references to all other components of a view through the child and parent node properties. Thus, for example, a table with very large amounts of data will not get correctly garbage collected. This is the reason why the browser uses more and more memory by navigating through the multi-page application until the application crashes.\r\n\r\n### Why does caching sometimes not work correctly?\r\nThe problem is in the created delegate, which is used as a key inside the map. The delegate is created via a createRenderer method, which in turn iterates through what type of component (what viewEncapsulation) it is to return the correct renderer.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// create the delegate\r\nconst delegate = this.delegate.createRenderer(hostElement, type);\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n// the called createRenderer Method\r\ncreateRenderer(element: any, type: RendererType2|null): Renderer2 {\r\n  if (!element || !type) {\r\n    return this.defaultRenderer;\r\n  }\r\n  switch (type.encapsulation) {\r\n    case ViewEncapsulation.Emulated: {\r\n      let renderer = this.rendererByCompId.get(type.id);\r\n      if (!renderer) {\r\n        renderer = new EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2(\r\n          this.eventManager, this.sharedStylesHost, type, this.appId);\r\n        this.rendererByCompId.set(type.id, renderer);\r\n      }\r\n      (<EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2>renderer).applyToHost(element);\r\n      return renderer;\r\n    }\r\n    // @ts-ignore TODO: Remove as part of FW-2290. TS complains about us dealing with an enum\r\n    // value that is not known (but previously was the value for ViewEncapsulation.Native)\r\n    case 1:\r\n    case ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom:\r\n      // TODO(FW-2290): remove the `case 1:` fallback logic and the warning in v12.\r\n      if ((typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) &&\r\n        // @ts-ignore TODO: Remove as part of FW-2290. TS complains about us dealing with an\r\n        // enum value that is not known (but previously was the value for\r\n        // ViewEncapsulation.Native)\r\n        !hasLoggedNativeEncapsulationWarning && type.encapsulation === 1) {\r\n        hasLoggedNativeEncapsulationWarning = true;\r\n        console.warn(\r\n          'ViewEncapsulation.Native is no longer supported. Falling back to ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom. The fallback will be removed in v12.');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return new ShadowDomRenderer(this.eventManager, this.sharedStylesHost, element, type);\r\n    default: {\r\n      if (!this.rendererByCompId.has(type.id)) {\r\n        const styles = flattenStyles(type.id, type.styles, []);\r\n        this.sharedStylesHost.addStyles(styles);\r\n        this.rendererByCompId.set(type.id, this.defaultRenderer);\r\n      }\r\n      return this.defaultRenderer;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/dom_renderer.ts#L91)\r\n\r\nIn the case of components that are of the ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom type, we have the memory leak problem. In contrast to the other cases, the component itself is stored as a property in the renderer, which contains the references to the other components of a view.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new object of the ShadowDomRenderer to be created is always created here, which also leads to the problem that the correct entry in the renderer cache is not found. So instead of using the already created ShadowDomRenderer, a new one is cached with every page change.\r\n\r\n### Demo to recreate\r\nI have created a small demo in which the problem can be well understood. I recommend using the Microsoft Edge browser for this, as it has a dev tool function that can be used to easily filter out the detached elements.\r\n\r\nThe demo includes three simple pages that can be accessed via buttons. The first page itself uses an Angular component that uses ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom. The second page accesses a component with ViewEncapsulation ShadowDom and the third page does not use a ShadowDom.\r\n\r\nIf you switch back and forth between the pages several times, you can see how more and more detached elements are built up by the first and second page, while the third page does not produce any detached elements.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64976254/198289765-df743570-7363-497e-88a1-6f9f30df2da2.png)\r\n\r\nThis also makes it easy to understand that all UI elements remain on the second page, even though only one child element uses the ShadowDom. In addition, this problem also exists even though no animations of the module are actively used at all.\r\n\r\n### Monkey Patch\r\nIn my work, I'm programming on larger Angular applications that use ShadowDom components and suffer from this memory leak problem. I will be very happy when the supposedly incorrect behavior is adjusted in an Angular update.\r\n\r\nUntil then, I like to share a monkeyPatch with you that you can use to adjust the behavior of RendererFactory2 and its cache to prevent the memory leak problem in your applications:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n  constructor(\r\n    // ...\r\n    rendererFactory2: RendererFactory2,\r\n  ) {\r\n    // 😱\r\n    (rendererFactory2 as any)['_rendererCache'] = new WeakMap();\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThe weak reference allows the browser's garbage collector to dispose of the object as soon as there is no other reference to the object. After a page change, only the renderer cache will reference UI elements that are no longer required (weak) and the detached elements will be removed as desired.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jonas383649/angular-memory-leak-problem.git\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.7\r\nNode: 14.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.8\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.7\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47892","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components not being garbage collected by browser causing major memory leaks\" (#47892)"},{"Id":"1425469590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T11:19:31","Actor":"rogerg93","Number":"47890","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve docs with best practices","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe documentation could use some update when teaching reactivity.

Only a few milliseconds to prevent flashing menus when you just move the mouse around. The user can still click on a nested item to trigger the menu instantly. This will improve the UX. It's really annoying if the menus are flashing.\r\n\r\nYou can test my suggested behavior in other proven menus like in Windows 10. Just open a folder and open the context menu. You'll see that the nested menus don't open immediately. They are delayed. Same behavior in VSCode. A shorter delay than the Windows menus, but they are delayed.

Great.\r\nBut if I open the same menu via the MatMenuTrigger from ts-file (`openMenu`), the first item is focused.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14\r\n- CDK/Material: 14\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 106\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25869","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-menu): Don't focus first element on open menu programmatically.\" (#25869)"},{"Id":"1425821702","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T16:01:09","Actor":"michahell","Number":"25883","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-radio-button): value of mat-radio-button without radio-button-group is null after selection","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nwhen having 3 `mat-radio-buttons` _without_ a `mat-radio-button` group, yet with a given `name` **@Input** so they belong to one group, listening to their change events and observing their `MatRadioChange` objects, their values remain `null` after selection.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nexample:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-qqftgq?file=src/app/example-component.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect the event$.value of each radiobutton to be true or false\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nthe event$.value s of each radiobutton are null\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:  @latest in example (in my own case, v13.3.9)\r\n- CDK/Material: @latest in example (in my case, v13.3.9)\r\n- Browser(s): chrome latest\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25883","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-radio-button): value of mat-radio-button without radio-button-group is null after selection\" (#25883)"},{"Id":"1425774250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T14:54:17","Actor":"zarend","Number":"25882","RawContent":null,"Title":"debugging","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25882","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"debugging\" (#25882)"},{"Id":"1425710051","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T14:13:06","Actor":"flensrocker","Number":"25881","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(DateAdapter): Use different DateAdapter on selected input","State":"open","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\n\nI have a global custom DateAdapter, which works fine (German locale, outputs string in \"dd.MM.yyyy\").\r\n\r\nNow I need on some inputs a different DateAdapter, which outputs \"yyyyMMdd\" (but showing \"dd.MM.yyyy\" in the UI).\r\nImplementing this other DateAdapter is no problem, it's working.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended way to assign a different DateAdapter to one input, while all others use the default/global DateAdapter?\r\n\r\nWhat I come up with is a directive, which I add to the `input[matDatepicker]` and `mat-datepicker`, to override the providers.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Directive({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  selector: \"mat-datepicker[bsMatStringDate],input[matDatepicker][bsMatStringDate]\",\r\n  providers: [{ provide: DateAdapter, useClass: BsMatStringDateAdapter, deps: [NativeDateAdapter] }],\r\n})\r\nexport class BsMatStringDateAdapterDirective {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving it on both components seems a bit superfluous, and the DateAdapter would be instantiated to times, doesn't it?\r\nIs there a better way to override the providers of the datepicker?\n\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\n\nOverriding the provider only on the MatDatepicker doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSince the MatDatepicker is assigned to the MatDatepickerInput, should that get the DateAdapter from the MatDatepicker?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nNothing really to reproduce.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ~14.2.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25881","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"help(DateAdapter): Use different DateAdapter on selected input\" (#25881)"},{"Id":"1425187140","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T10:53:48","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25879","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all dependencies to the Angular 15 RC","State":"closed","Body":"Some dependencies were still on their RC versions.

However inside the source code (paginator.ts), that event is emitted at the end of the function:\r\n```  \r\n_changePageSize(pageSize: number) {\r\n    // Current page needs to be updated to reflect the new page size. Navigate to the page\r\n    // containing the previous page's first item.\r\n    const startIndex = this.pageIndex * this.pageSize;\r\n    const previousPageIndex = this.pageIndex;\r\n\r\n    this.pageIndex = Math.floor(startIndex / pageSize) || 0;\r\n    this.pageSize = pageSize;\r\n    this._emitPageEvent(previousPageIndex);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\nThis means that when using this page event you cannot do anything BEFORE the loading starts. I'm developing an app that uses rather large tables, and I want to be able to display a loading icon before the table starts updating so the app doesn't just hang. But when I show my loading icon in the (page) event, it only displays AFTER the table has finished updating and hangs for a long time. I've spent many hours trying to find a work around for this and haven't been able to figure anything out. Perhaps there is a reason as to why the line `this._emitPageEvent(previousPageIndex);` is here, but to my very amateurish eyes I feel like this could be solved by moving that line to the top.\r\n\r\nApologies in advance if this post doesn't follow the etiquette, I've not made many of these so I'm still learning. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have a table with a very long dataset\r\n2. Add a paginator\r\n3. Bind the page event on the paginator\r\n4. Have the page event do literally anything, let's say just write some text to the console\r\n5. Change the page size on the paginator from the default 50 to the full table's length\r\n6. Watch the console to see the app will hang until it finishes loading and only THEN do you see the text appear in the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect the page event to be fired first.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe page event is fired after.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25865","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatPaginator): Page event fires too late.\" (#25865)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-10-31T03:30:03.4409337Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2568}

However, each example type has a different `package.json`, which comes from `aio/tools/examples/shared/boilerplate/*`). In order to ensure that the dependencies in each examples `package.json` are the same as the ones in the symlinked `node_modules/` (i.e. the ones that CI tests are run with), we have a script (`yarn run sync deps`) that can sync dependencies from `shared/package.json` into the boilerplate `package.json` files.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this script had to be run manually, which was easy to forget/not know about. This resulted in the boilerplate dependencies often being out-of-sync with the ones in `shared/package.json` and by extension the ones that were actually installed in `node_modules/`.\r\n\r\nThis commit helps keep the boilerplate dependencies up-to-date in the following ways:\r\n- Adds the `sync-deps` script to the `postinstall` scripts to ensure dependencies will remain in sync whenever someone manually updates dependencies in `shared/package.json`.\r\n- Runs the `sync-deps` script as a Renovate post-upgrade task to ensure that the depenencies will remain in sync whenever Renovate updates dependencies in `shared/package.json`.\r\n  For more info on configuring post-upgrade tasks in Renovate, see:\r\n  - [postUpgradeTasks][1]\r\n  - [allowedPostUpgradeCommands][2]\r\n  - [allowPostUpgradeCommandTemplating][3]\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nFor the Renovate change to take effect, the [global config][4] in `angular/dev-infra` also needs to be updated.

A type-only import which uses the `type` keyword *inside the curly braces*\r\n2. `emitDecoratorMetadata` is `true` in tsconfig.json\r\n3. Certain type imports\r\n4. Production build\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThis problem happens when you use type-only imports (using the `type` keyword) using the [syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-5.html#type-modifiers-on-import-names) introduced in TypeScript 4.5 where you use the `type` keyword inside the curly braces:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { type SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\nand does *not* happen when you use the `type` keyword outside the curly braces:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWe enable `emitDecoratorMetadata` in tsconfig.json due to [eslint rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/) which require type information (otherwise it thinks DI classes in the constructor should be type-only imports, for example, but they can't be)\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThis problem only happens with certain imports, and only with `@angular` imports. Known failing types:\r\n\r\n- `import { type SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core'`\r\n- `import { type Route } from '@angular/router'`\r\n\r\nKnown types that don't cause the error:\r\n\r\n- `import { type Routes, type CanLoad } from '@angular/router'`\r\n- `import { type OnInit, type OnChanges } from '@angular/core';`\r\n- `import { type HttpHeaders, type HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http'`\r\n- any other npm module, e.g. `import { type Observable } from 'rxjs'` - this works fine\r\n- any local module, e.g. `import { type MyInterface } from './interface'` - this works fine\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThis problem only happens on production builds. Regular development builds and `ng serve` work without issue.

This is to support the case where a user sets `\"react-jsx\"` in their `tsconfig.json` but then toggles development mode directly in esbuild.\n\n    **esbuild vs Babel vs TS vs...**\n\n    There are a few differences between the various technologies that implement automatic JSX runtimes. The JSX transform in esbuild follows a mix of Babel's and TypeScript's behavior:\n\n    -   When an element has `__source` or `__self` props:\n        -   Babel: Print an error about a deprecated transform plugin\n        -   TypeScript: Allow the props\n        -   swc: Hard crash\n        -   **esbuild**: Print an error — Following Babel was chosen for this one because this might help people catch configuration issues where JSX files are being parsed by multiple tools\n\n    -   Element has an \"implicit true\" key prop, e.g. `<a key />`:\n        -   Babel: Print an error indicating that \"key\" props require an explicit value\n        -   TypeScript: Silently omit the \"key\" prop\n        -   swc: Hard crash\n        -   **esbuild**: Print an error like Babel — This might help catch legitimate programming mistakes\n\n    -   Element has spread children, e.g. `<a>{...children}</a>`\n        -   Babel: Print an error stating that React doesn't support spread children\n        -   TypeScript: Use static jsx function and pass children as-is, including spread operator\n        -   swc: same as Babel\n        -   **esbuild**: Same as TypeScript\n\n    Also note that TypeScript has some bugs regarding JSX development mode and the generation of `lineNumber` and `columnNumber` values. Babel's values are accurate though, so esbuild's line and column numbers match Babel. Both numbers are 1-based and columns are counted in terms of UTF-16 code units.\n\n    This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;jgoz](https://togithub.com/jgoz).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The presence of this file and its purpose may be confusing for new developer.\r\n- When referencing your static assets places in `assets` folder, you have to add the `./assets/` prefix in all your URLs. When you different kind of assets, you often end up with URLs like `./assets/images/my-image.jpg` adding an extra prefix, making your URLs longer.\r\n- There's no way to add static files at the root of your `dist` folder directly without modifying the build in `angular.json` config.\r\n- If you start to add static files to be copied at the root of your `dist` folder, your `src/` folder will start to be cluttered. Moreover, you'll have to add an entry fo each of the new files you want to add in the `angular.json` config.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI propose a small change in the structure that would solve all these issues at once:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsrc/\r\n  |- public/\r\n  |  |- index.html\r\n  |  |- favicon.ico\r\n  |- ...\r\n```\r\nAnd the `assets` section of `angular.json` becomes:\r\n```json\r\n            \"assets\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n                \"input\": \"src/public\",\r\n                \"output\": \".\"\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing all the issues listed above, this makes the starter template simpler, and use the same convention as all other major frameworks (ie Vue, React, Svelte...) for static assets.\r\nI don't see any drawbacks from making this change, beside a small change in habits.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to accept this change, I'm willing to make the PR for it 🙂 \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI considered 3 alternatives for the solution:\r\n\r\n- Same solution as above, but putting everything  under `assets/` folder instead of `public`:\r\n  * May be confusing for existing Angular developer, as this would remove the need for `./assets/` prefix in URLs\r\n  * Static files like `index.html` can't really be called `assets`\r\n\r\n- Keep existing `assets/` folder and add a `public/` folder\r\n  * Doesn't solve the first 2 issues\r\n  * May be confusing as to the difference between the two folders\r\n  * `assets/` folder becomes redundant\r\n\r\n- Same solution as above, but using a more explicit `static/` folder name instead of `public`:\r\n  * The `public` convention is already used in a lot of frameworks and tools in the web ecosystem, so it doesn't feel right to add *yet another convention*.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23644","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Proposal] Simplify starter template by moving all static files and assets in a single folder\" (#23644)"},{"Id":"1321877642","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-29T09:00:45","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23656","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update aspect_bazel_lib to 1.8.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23656","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update aspect_bazel_lib to 1.8.1\" (#23656)"},{"Id":"1321771353","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-29T07:40:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"23654","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.1.17","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.1.16` -> `v2.1.17` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.17`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.16...v2.1.17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.16...v2.1.17)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

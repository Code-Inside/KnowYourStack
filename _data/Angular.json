I would expect any Inputs passed to the mocked component to be set on the component itself, but instead the properties are non-existent. The only properties that appear to exist on the mocked component are any initialized properties on the mock itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a standalone parent component that has a standalone child component\r\n2. Add a ViewChild in the parent component for the child component\r\n3. Write a unit test that uses .overrideComponent to mock the child component, and then expect the parent component's child component public property from the Input() bining to be set, and notice that it is never set. \r\n\r\nIf you get rid of the parent/child components being standalone, and just declare them in the test, it will work as expected.\r\n\r\nBroken Example - https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-kue3py?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nWorking Example (removed standalone) - https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-x4dkjz?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp.component.html,src%2Fmain-testing.ts,src%2Fapp.component.spec.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-kue3py?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular: 16.1.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThis appears to be related to standalone components, as when standalone is taken out of the equation for the parent and child components, all @Input() properties appear to be set on the ViewChild component.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51603","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Standalone ViewChild unit test mocks do not get @Input() properties set on them\" (#51603)"},{"Id":"1876037826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T18:06:56","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"51607","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency gulp-conventional-changelog to v4","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [gulp-conventional-changelog](https://togithub.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/gulp-conventional-changelog#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)) | devDependencies | major | [`^3.0.0` -> `^4.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/gulp-conventional-changelog/3.0.0/4.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog (gulp-conventional-changelog)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/releases/tag/gulp-conventional-changelog-v4.0.0): gulp-conventional-changelog: v4.0.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/compare/gulp-conventional-changelog-v3.0.0...gulp-conventional-changelog-v4.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   Node >= 16 is required\n-   Now all presets are exports preset config factory function. conventional-changelog-preset-loader now exports new loadPreset and createPresetLoader functions.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/17.0.0-next.1...17.0.0-next.2)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` default value is now `true`. This causes CSS of components to be removed from the DOM when destroyed. You retain the previous behaviour by providing the `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` injection token.\n\n    ```ts\n    import {REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n    ...\n    providers: [{\n      provide: REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY,\n      useValue: false,\n    }]\n    ```\n\n##### router\n\n-   The following Router properties have been removed from\n    the public API:\n\n    -   canceledNavigationResolution\n    -   paramsInheritanceStrategy\n    -   titleStrategy\n    -   urlUpdateStrategy\n    -   malformedUriErrorHandler\n\n    These should instead be configured through the `provideRouter` or\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` APIs.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [698c058e1c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/698c058e1c975c573722407f4843a4a774ceb92a) | fix | remove code duplication between entry-points ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n| [18be804c03](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/18be804c038e8d81a60c9a72521cfa640c8a1d5a) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [86c5e34601](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/86c5e34601d7901a11688124aa902646524177eb) | fix | remove code duplication between entry-points ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [de2550d988](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/de2550d9886394e1ecde586d72bf2bab5b65cb39) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n| [3bca9db4a5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3bca9db4a56d61ac22b4ce87591d8862606177c8) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [dbffdc09c2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dbffdc09c25c93868aa13ae368c9fd21a4c359fb) | fix | avoid duplicated code between entry-points (primary, testing, rxjs-interop) ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n| [45d2ded0ea](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/45d2ded0ea9ef414948256099f8dc9c4598fdc2b) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n| [006577f39c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/006577f39c0e46e37491e44687142521fe7fab54) | fix | handle hydration of view containers that use component hosts as anchors ([#&#8203;51456](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51456)) |\n| [1423bfbf8f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1423bfbf8ffa3b43d0dea41054c8f950e669a697) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n| [3a19d6b743](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3a19d6b7437e1812ae70b3784fd6a8a185b330b1) | fix | run afterRender callbacks outside of the Angular zone ([#&#8203;51385](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51385)) |\n| [685d01e106](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/685d01e1065dad6dc52eaac9eb9527100994f5ce) | perf | chain template instructions ([#&#8203;51546](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51546)) |\n\n##### language-service\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [88b1575271](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/88b157527172d70ed3e5aa11aa8b7963a8612e49) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c340d6e044](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c340d6e0440bd982dff6f9f4f4229931c62d2c08) | feat | enable removal of styles on component destroy by default ([#&#8203;51571](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51571)) |\n| [c5daa6ce77](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c5daa6ce776724d44c02cc97f1a349a85cb2a819) | feat | expose `EventManagerPlugin` in the public API.

I don't know whether this is actually a bug or I did not understand something about any of yarn, typescript, esm, commonjs, angular, webpack...\r\n\r\nWhen using a simple angular project as a yarn workspace, I cannot use the exports of a sibling project.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is the description of how to reproduce the issue, I attached the whole project as well\r\n\r\n[myproject.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/12464740/myproject.zip)\r\n\r\n1. create a yarn workspace root package.json, pointing to the two workspaces we will create now\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"myproject\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"angular\",\r\n    \"lib\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. create a simple angular project\r\n`ng new angular` (then, keep the default value for everything that is asked)\r\n3. add the \"private\": true entry in its package.json to indicate it is a workspace\r\n4. create a very simple library called lib\r\nwith the following package.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"@mylib/lib\",\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"private\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the following index.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const somevariable = \"something\";\r\n```\r\n5. indicate in the package.json of the angular workspace the dependency toward the sibling library, adding `\"@mylib/lib\": \"^0.1.0\",` in its dependency section.\r\n6. in the root component on the angular workspace, make use of the variable\r\n`import { somevariable } from '@mylib/lib';`\r\nand then, set the title to somevariable \r\n```typescript\r\n...\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  title = somevariable;\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n7. run `ng serve`\r\n\r\nYou will see that somevariable does not appear.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/1181438/7bc2edf6-3059-423e-a311-2d6bc6a289dd)\r\n\r\nStrangely, changing `import { somevariable } from '@mylib/lib';` into `import { somevariable } from '../../../lib';` works around this issue. You need to `rm -rf .angular/ && ng serve` to actually see the impact of the change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/1181438/fdf4e2a0-ee8f-4a27-8388-26edcef10df6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n✔  ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.0\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nRunning `ng build` in development mode, I could find out that the webpack export was actually empty where `somevariable` should have been.\r\n\r\nthe bundled code looks like this\r\n```\r\nclass AppComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    this.title = _mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.somevariable;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith `_mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__` defined like this `/* harmony import */ var _mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! @mylib/lib */ 6479);`\r\n\r\nThen, the content associated to 6479 is the following\r\n```\r\n/***/ 6479:\r\n/*!***********************!*\\\r\n  !*** ../lib/index.ts ***!\r\n  \\***********************/\r\n/***/ (() => {\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/***/ })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume there has been some too eager tree-shaking somewhere.\r\n\r\nThank you again for angular.

Single toggle button instances are meeting accessibility requirements because they have a change in text or icon in addition to color.\r\n\r\nSee WCAG context below:\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): “This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast.” \r\nThis success criterion is met, but is only applicable to the default (un-selected) state.\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\nThis is not being met. \r\n\r\nWCAG [Use of color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color): If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue, but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.\r\nThis implies that a design solution that meets 3:1 contrast is sufficient in meeting the “Use of Color” success criterion.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the component demo and does not require StackBlitz: https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe contrast ratio of the selected state must meet at least 3:1 to fulfill WCAG success criterion for non-text contrast and use of color.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCurrently the selected state of mat-button-toggle-group uses a fill color of #E0E0E0. On an #FFFFFF background, the contrast ratio is only 1.32:1. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular/Material 16.2.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button-toggle-group): Accessibility issue of WCAG non-text contrast and WCAG use of color\" (#27748)"},{"Id":"1875065745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T15:10:20","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27746","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: omit repetitions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27746","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: omit repetitions\" (#27746)"},{"Id":"1872006393","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T14:41:23","Actor":"nagamanikandanKannappan","Number":"27724","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): @angular/google-maps not working in Angular CLI: 15.0.5","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n**_ng version_**\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.5\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.1.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    15.0.5\r\n@angular/google-maps            16.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Issues:_**\r\n\r\n1.

Specifically, the `aria-expanded` property will not correctly follow the open sub-menu. After some investigation this seems to simply be caused by the `CdkMenuTrigger` not using `detectChanges()` or `markForCheck()` from the `ChangeDetectorRef` after opening and closing the menu overlay. The attachment state of the menu overlay is used to populate `aria-expanded` directly.\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by having the `OnPush` parent listen to `(opened)` and `(closed)` events emitted by the trigger, but that is not very scalable since each menu item would then require two additional handlers inside every `OnPush` component.\r\n\r\nI will be sending a pull request that will make the `CdkMenuTrigger` call relevant methods from the `ChangeDetectorRef` at appropriate times to support being placed in `OnPush` components.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-uc7xxl\r\n\r\n*Note: In the StackBlitz the style of menu items is changed based on the `aria-expanded` property of the element. If the element has `aria-expanded` set to `true` the item will appear with a black background and white text. This is supposed to make it easy to see how `aria-expanded` updates.*\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a an inline `CdkMenu` or a `CdkMenuBar` in a component using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`\r\n2. Add sub-menus to the items of the inline menu\r\n3. Click any of the items to open its sub-menu\r\n4. Hover to any other item with a sub-menu\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen hovering over another item with a sub-menu, the `aria-expanded` property of the newly hovered item should be set to `true` and that of the previous item should be set to `false`. The `aria-expanded` property should be `true` for the item that has an open sub-menu at all times. When clicking outside the menu all sub-menus should close and `aria-expanded` should be `false` for all items in the menu.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `aria-expanded` property continues to be `true` on the initially clicked element regardless of the item hovered and where the open sub-menu is. It also continues to be `true` for an item even when all sub-menus are closed.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Version 116.0.5845.110 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27725","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/menu): Trigger does not update ARIA values correctly in `OnPush` components\" (#27725)"},{"Id":"1871958837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-29T15:49:59","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"27723","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix code scanning alert - Inefficient regular expression","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Warning: The suggested title contains the alert rule name.

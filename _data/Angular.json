It is also not being imported anywhere else in the project. As the `console.log` message in the `foo.ts` file states, I do not expect that line to print at run time. I do not expect that line to print because TypeScript says that type-only imports \"always gets fully erased, so there‚Äôs no remnant of it at runtime\". The actual behavior does not match my expected behavior because the `console.log` message is being printed at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-54e8de)\r\nor\r\n[GitHub repo](https://github.com/samherrmann/angular-sandbox/commit/9c77f6a57b2c7d2bc036700d0df278232ef0a314)\r\n\r\nObserve the console.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.0\r\nNode: 12.15.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.0\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.5\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37900","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Injector does not respect TypeScript type-only imports\" (#37900)"},{"Id":"650258955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-02T23:50:30","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"37899","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade lighthouse to 6.1.0","State":"open","Body":"To take advantage of lazy loaded images `img[loading=lazy]`, this commit\r\nupgrades lighthouse to version 6.1.0.\r\n\r\nCloses #35965\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is because we\r\nrecently added a new test that asserts that injecting `ViewRef` results in\r\na `NullInjectorError`.\r\n\r\nDue to limitations in TypeScript and in polyfills for `setPrototypeOf`, the error\r\ncannot be thrown as `ViewRef` is always considered injectable. In reality, `ViewRef`\r\nshould not be injectable, as explicitly noted in https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/c00f4ab2ae703e8a3ee4a3850170c9bbf0f9bc42.\r\n\r\nThere seems no way to simulate the proper prototype chain in such browsers\r\nthat do not natively support `__proto__`, so TypeScript and `core-js` polyfills\r\nsimply break the prototype chain and assign inherited properties directly\r\non `ViewRef`. i.e. so that `ViewRef.__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` exists and DI picks it up.\r\n\r\nThere is a way for TypeScript to theoretically generate proper prototype chain in\r\nES5 output, but they intend to only bother about the proper prototype chain in ES6\r\nwhere `setPrototypeOf` etc. are officially standardized. See the response: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1601#issuecomment-94892833.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a feeling  that it's better keeping the `hasOwnProperty` logic (as added with c00f4ab2ae703e8a3ee4a3850170c9bbf0f9bc42),\r\nas IE10 will not fail but rather just be less strict. At the same time though, it could also\r\nbe an option to just enforce consistency by reverting your fix. Either way seems not 100%\r\nideal.

This can become a performance issue, for example with a large switch block (50 cases) inside a component that is repeated many times (1000+). Each inactive switch case has a placeholder comment node for each \r\n\r\nIn some manual tests I did, the chrome memory profiler showed that there were > 13000 comment nodes, and most of them were from a single ngSwitch inside a table cell component (I tested this by removing all the cells). This accounted for over 4% of total memory consumption in a large app. According to a theory of mine this will also slow down other actions on the page due to the increased DOM size which decreases the cache locality of non-comment elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI have a theory that the framework can automatically skip creating comment nodes that are unnecessary. For ngSwitch, no comment nodes should be necessary if there are no \"interleaved\" elements or text content between the switch cases. If there is only one \"interleaved\" thing, then only one comment node should be necessary to keep track of the location of the inactive group of cases.\r\n\r\nThe same trick should also work for ngIf, with the caveat that we still need placeholder comment nodes unless the compiler knows that the if blocks are mutually exclusive, and also they don't have content between them.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, but please let me know if I can clarify anything. I'm sure there are other good solutions too, so I would like to start some brainstorming.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37880","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Automatically reduce number of placeholder comment nodes for ngIf and ngSwitch\" (#37880)"},{"Id":"649348170","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-01T21:57:34","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"37879","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove unused fakeAsyncFallback and asyncFallback","State":"open","Body":"`zone.js` 0.8.25 introduces `zone-testing` bundle and move all `fakeAsync/async` logic\r\nfrom `@angular/core/testing` to `zone.js` package.

Swap to `page.emulateMediaType` which behaves identically.\n\n##### Removal of `require('puppeteer/DeviceDescriptors')` ([#&#8203;6043](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6043))\n\nThis top level file has been removed from the Puppeteer package. The same data is exposed via `puppeteer.devices`, so swap to that:\n\n```js\n// before\nconst devices = require('puppeteer/DeviceDescriptors');\n\n// after\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst devices = puppeteer.devices\n```\n\n##### Removal of `require('puppeteer/Errors')` ([#&#8203;6043](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6043))\n\nThis top level file has been removed from the Puppeteer package. The same data is exposed via `puppeteer.errors`, so swap to that:\n\n```js\n// before\nconst errors = require('puppeteer/Errors');\n\n// after\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst errors = puppeteer.errors\n```\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   We've continued our drive to migrate to a new documentation system using TSDoc. These docs are available in the [`new-docs`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/new-docs/puppeteer.md) directory on GitHub. These aren't ready for use just yet but we're making great progress. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6118](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6118). \n\n-   We've continued improving our TypeScript definitions. Our tests are now migrated to TypeScript ([#&#8203;5830](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5830)) so that we're consuming our own API. Work continues to ship built-in type definitions in a future version. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6124](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6124).\n\n-   We've started restructuring Puppeteer to work towards being able to better support an environment agnostic Puppeteer module. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6125](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6125).  \n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`85d8dbf`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/85d8dbf) - chore: mark v5.0.0\n[`29f7e16`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/29f7e16) - chore(docs): reduce warnings when generating docs ([#&#8203;6138](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6138))\n[`221d172`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/221d172) - chore: add typecheck command ([#&#8203;6140](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6140))\n[`6474edb`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6474edb) - feat(types): add types for `$eval` ([#&#8203;6135](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6135))\n[`8370ec8`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/8370ec8) - feat(types): add (and fix) `evaluateHandle` types ([#&#8203;6130](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6130))\n[`3c0dc45`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/3c0dc45) - chore: update Windows skipped tests.

option, **there're 3 TerserPlugins**:\r\nSo I tried to remove the last two minimizers and it works.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires */\r\nconst

First of all thanks for your amazing works on Angular and Angular components :).\r\n\r\nToday I want to propose to enrich the current elevation API by providing lighter background color depending on elevation level just like it's exposed here [https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties). Of course it will be enabled only for dark themes.\r\n\r\nWhy this feature request ? Because some components like `mat-expansion-panel` are very hard to distinct inside a `mat-card` because they have the same background color. This problem is also present in light themes but there is no material recommandations for it. I'm not a design expert and I have no idea how to handle this.

There is no check for an existing header with the same key before the line\r\n\r\n`this.headers.set(key, headerValues);`\r\n\r\nMy interpretation is that this is a valid way to use the Set-Cookie header, due to the method getSetCookie() existing on the Headers API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers/getSetCookie)\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is an interceptor on the server side that acts as a proxy for cookies between the user and an API\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const headersInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (\r\n  req: HttpRequest<unknown>,\r\n  next: HttpHandlerFn\r\n): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> => {\r\n  const request = inject(REQUEST, { optional: true });\r\n  const response = inject(RESPONSE, { optional: true });\r\n  const environment = inject(ENVIRONMENT);\r\n\r\n  //?

Radio buttons of a group work with same formControl instance with the way things are implemented in my case. The inner `<input type=\"radio\" />` does NOT use RadioControlValueAccessor.\r\n\r\nI let my custom component have 'disabled' Input and I do document that when this input is disabled=true then that takes precedence over the status of the form control (that it gets provided through [formControl], [formControlName], etc...), otherwise form control status is the one in effect. This works just fine for selectively disabling single radio buttons, yet, I get the warning from https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/55e3a3a47cddefebc28af03ce58ece136d41a391/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L94 of \r\n\r\n> It looks like you're using the disabled attribute with a reactive form directive. If you set disabled to true\r\n  when you set up this control in your component class, the disabled attribute will actually be set in the DOM for\r\n  you. We recommend using this approach to avoid 'changed after checked' errors.\r\n  \r\nBut thats not true, because that effect may not happen for ControlValueAccessors that are implemented outside Angular, unlike eg.: RadioControlValueAccessor, see\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/55e3a3a47cddefebc28af03ce58ece136d41a391/packages/forms/src/directives/radio_control_value_accessor.ts#L244.\r\n\r\nBut thats not the accessor I am using anywhere in my code, so this warning still shows up, even though its not related to my usecase, where the behavior is well documented.\r\n\r\nSo now I have to:\r\n1) Be stuck with the warning, even though its unrelated to my code\r\n2) Use a different name other than \"disabled\"\r\n\r\nCould the warning be shifted to the subclasses of BuiltInControlValueAccessor that actually do the disabled prop writing behavior instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n@angular/forms: 17.0.9\r\nNode v22.1.0\r\nNpm 10.7.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Warning regarding \"disabled\" property of [formControl] family of directives refers to behavior thats specific to a subset of ControlValueAccessors, but shows up for all of them\" (#57793)"},{"Id":"2522748173","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-12T15:40:00","Actor":"clydin","Number":"57792","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(platform-browser): modernize/combine shared style host element management","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57792","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(platform-browser): modernize/combine shared style host element management\" (#57792)"},{"Id":"2522621602","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-12T14:56:10","Actor":"4zriel","Number":"57791","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): update ComponentRef.setInput to use keyof C for input name","State":"closed","Body":"Update setInput method in ```ComponentRef``` to accept ```keyof C``` for the name parameter instead of ```string```. this improves type safety by ensuring that only valid keys of the component's inputs can be passed\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other... Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nThe ```ComponentRef.setInput``` method accepts ```name: string```, which does not enforce type safety for input keys and allows any string to be passed. With the introduction of the new Signal API, this could potentially lead to hard-to-notice errors. While using ```keyof C``` is a small improvement, it at least throws a build-time error if an invalid input name is passed. Ideally, it would be better to narrow the type to only accept inputs marked by the ```@Input()``` decorator, but I think it is only possible to narrow it with ```InputSignal``` in future.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThe setInput method now accepts name: ```keyof C```, ensuring that only valid input keys from the component type ```C``` can be passed.

Before upgrading from Angular 15 to Angular 18 with the new application builder, we used `paths` configurations in `tsconfig.json`, combined with `baseUr`l and a Webpack plugin, to directly reference the public API from our projects folder (where the libraries are located). This setup allowed Angular to trigger a rebuild whenever we made changes in a library.\r\n\r\nBefore migrating our main app to Angular 18, I tested this setup with a new Angular 18 project containing a single library. I found that the paths configuration should be supported out of the box with Angular 18 without needing additional changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the migration, I haven‚Äôt been able to get Angular (or esbuild) to recognize the `paths` defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. It seems that Angular is reading the compiled versions of the libraries inside `node_modules`, ignoring the paths configuration in `tsconfig.json`. I've tried various configurations, including changing `moduleResolution` to `bundler`, but none of these have resolved the issue. While VS Code's IntelliSense correctly recognizes the `paths` defined in `tsconfig.json` and does not show errors, running ng serve results in a series of errors:  \r\n<br>\r\n<b>  TS2307: Cannot find module '...' or its corresponding type declarations.</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n[Reproduction](https://github.com/MPalix86/angular-issue-28388)\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTS2307: Cannot find module '....' or its corresponding type declarations.

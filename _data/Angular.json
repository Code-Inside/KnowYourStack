The images provided to support this are named `image.1x.jpg`, `image.2x.jpg` and `image.3x.jpg`. Also there are multiple ways of building the application, causing the actual image to change based on the build variant, meaning the size of the image is not known.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to type:\r\n```html\r\n<img src=\"assets/image.jpg\" srcset=\"assets/image.1x.jpg 1x, assets/image.2x.jpg 2x, assets/image.3x.jpg 3x\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I want is to utilise the possibility of writing a custom `ImageLoader`:\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  provide: IMAGE_LOADER,\r\n  useValue: (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {\r\n    const srcComponents = config.src.split(\".\");\r\n\r\n    const density = config.density !== undefined ? config.density : \"1x\";\r\n    srcComponents.splice(-1, 0, density);\r\n\r\n    return srcComponents.join(\".\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen type the `img`-tag in the following way:\r\n```html\r\n<img fill ngSrc=\"assets/image.jpg\" ngSrcset=\"1x, 2x, 3x\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough, there is no property `density` on `ImageLoaderConfig` of course - the only size-related property available is `width`. `width` is however `NaN` when the image size is unknown, so it is not helpful here. Would it be possible to provide each of the density multipliers in a property `density` or in some other way to enable this?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA new property `density` on `ImageLoaderConfig` that contains the density multiplier for each call to the `ImageLoader`. At least I guess that it is more preferable than e.g. changing the type of `width` to `number | string | undefined`, then passing the density multiplier value there(?).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIt would be preferable if the density multipliers could be defined in `ngSrcset` instead of in the `ImageLoader` implementation itself, as this would allow for each image to support different sets of density multipliers.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have the following solution that works, but as mentioned, only for fixed density multipliers defined in the `ImageLoader` implementation itself (in this case 1x, 2x, 3x), and also feels hacky:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  provide: IMAGE_LOADER,\r\n  useFactory: (): ImageLoader => {\r\n    let densityMultiplier = 1;\r\n\r\n    return (config: ImageLoaderConfig): string => {\r\n      const srcComponents = config.src.split(\".\");\r\n      srcComponents.splice(-1, 0, `${pixelDensity}x`);\r\n\r\n      if (config.width === undefined) {\r\n        densityMultiplier = 1;\r\n      } else {\r\n        densityMultiplier++;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return srcComponents.join(\".\");\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54100","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide flexible way to generate `srcset` based on `ngSrcset` density multipliers when image size is unknown\" (#54100)"},{"Id":"2102453918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:57:50","Actor":"devversion","Number":"54098","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler-cli): enable dom binding type checking by default","State":"open","Body":"Currently Angular only validates that elements are existing as per our runtime DOM schema.\r\nAdditionally, we validate that non-directive input bindings are valid according to the schema.\r\n\r\nWe **never** validate whether the value of the expression is compatible with the targeted\r\nDOM property.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\nThis time there is only one breaking change, and it only matters for people using Deno. Deno tests that use esbuild will now fail unless you make the change described below.\n\n-   Work around API deprecations in Deno 1.40.x ([#&#8203;3609](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3609), [#&#8203;3611](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3611))\n\n    [Deno 1.40.0](https://deno.com/blog/v1.40) was just released and introduced run-time warnings about certain APIs that esbuild uses. With this release, esbuild will work around these run-time warnings by using newer APIs if they are present and falling back to the original APIs otherwise. This should avoid the warnings without breaking compatibility with older versions of Deno.\n\n    Unfortunately, doing this introduces a breaking change. The newer child process APIs lack a way to synchronously terminate esbuild's child process, so calling `esbuild.stop()` from within a Deno test is no longer sufficient to prevent Deno from failing a test that uses esbuild's API (Deno fails tests that create a child process without killing it before the test ends). To work around this, esbuild's `stop()` function has been changed to return a promise, and you now have to change `esbuild.stop()` to `await esbuild.stop()` in all of your Deno tests.\n\n-   Reorder implicit file extensions within `node_modules` ([#&#8203;3341](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3341), [#&#8203;3608](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3608))\n\n    In [version 0.18.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.18.0), esbuild changed the behavior of implicit file extensions within `node_modules` directories (i.e. in published packages) to prefer `.js` over `.ts` even when the `--resolve-extensions=` order prefers `.ts` over `.js` (which it does by default). However, doing that also accidentally made esbuild prefer `.css` over `.ts`, which caused problems for people that published packages containing both TypeScript and CSS in files with the same name.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will reorder TypeScript file extensions immediately after the last JavaScript file extensions in the implicit file extension order instead of putting them at the end of the order. Specifically the default implicit file extension order is `.tsx,.ts,.jsx,.js,.css,.json` which used to become `.jsx,.js,.css,.json,.tsx,.ts` in `node_modules` directories. With this release it will now become `.jsx,.js,.tsx,.ts,.css,.json` instead.\n\n    Why even rewrite the implicit file extension order at all? One reason is because the `.js` file is more likely to behave correctly than the `.ts` file. The behavior of the `.ts` file  may depend on `tsconfig.json` and the `tsconfig.json` file may not even be published, or may use `extends` to refer to a base `tsconfig.json` file that wasn't published. People can get into this situation when they forget to add all `.ts` files to their `.npmignore` file before publishing to npm. Picking `.js` over `.ts` helps make it more likely that resulting bundle will behave correctly.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.13`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.5.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   build(deps-dev): bump jsdom from 23.2.0 to 24.0.0 by [@&#8203;dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632)\n-   feat: Implement EventSource by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608)\n-   fix: readable body by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Normalization is done here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/load-proxy-config.ts\r\n\r\nThis step perhaps mistakenly treats regular expressions as globs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // TODO: Consider upstreaming glob support\r\n  for (const key of Object.keys(normalizedProxy)) {\r\n    if (isDynamicPattern(key)) {\r\n      const { output } = parseGlob(key);\r\n      normalizedProxy[`^${output}$`] = normalizedProxy[key];\r\n      delete normalizedProxy[key];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser we had:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"/internal-api\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    context: \"!/hui/**\",\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    logLevel: \"debug\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild something like this should be equivalent if the configuration would go to Vite without changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  \"/internal-api\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8082\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/(?!hui).*\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false\r\n  },\r\n  \"^\\\\/$\": {\r\n    target: \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n    secure: false,\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nng-packagr                      17.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26970","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI messes up proxy.conf.js regex proxy -settings passed to Vite when using esbuild\" (#26970)"},{"Id":"2102362827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T15:21:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26974","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis commit fixes an issue were negated globs in proxy config were not process correctly when using vite.\r\n\r\nCloses #26970","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26974","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly handle glob negation in proxy config when using vite\" (#26974)"},{"Id":"2102202540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T14:54:37","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26972","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): handle regular expressions in proxy config when using Vite","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit enables proxies to have a RegExp as context when using Vite.

In particular, select the secondary palette automatically based on the primary palette (secondary is intended to be a more muted version of primary). We still allow the user to select what tertiary color to pair with their primary, since the spec doesn't make the same sort of assumptions about the tertiary color.\r\n\r\nNote: because our demo targets styles at the .mat-primary, .mat-accent, .mat-error classes, it winds up overriding the default color combo that users would see out of the box for the mat-select (a primary form-field with a secondary selected option). This is one example where the M2 color=\"primary/accent/warn\" API doesn't quite align with how colors work in M3. We do not expect users to apply colors in this way, and we probably shouldn't do it in our demo either.

The problem is, the view does not properly update due to any events that happen. In my example I dragEnd, the data comes back from the server, and is not updated on the screen until I click or hover something. As soon as that happens the data shows properly. Happened in angular v15 and v17. changeDetectionRef.detectChanges() doesnt work to fix it either.\r\n\r\nI have other actions that call the exact same event (hitting the same endpoint) and when they return, the data shows properly. Perhaps it is an issue with the mat-table not playing nice with the drag end. I have seen many stack overflows alluding to this same issue. Im guessing this will just get closed because it 'doesnt exist' but there is definitely a bug in there experienced by many\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

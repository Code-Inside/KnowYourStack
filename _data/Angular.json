Essentially there were two signals:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsig1 = signal(5)\r\nsig2 = signal(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea was then to compare the unboxed values of these two signals, but by accident they were left unboxed like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.sig1 > this.sig2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nseemingly this condition would never return true since two signals would never be <, <=, >, >= each other (although could be === ?)\r\n\r\nThis seems like a very easy mistake to make, especially since signals are so new. of course simply unboxing the two signals allows the correct logic to happen but it seems like any dev regardless of experience could take some time to figure out why their logic is not working correctly due to this.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to get error output for this similar to what happens when trying to compare two types that shouldnt be compared (like string and int)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"767\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-21 at 4 25 27â€¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/14967057/59b4a7aa-4b40-4bfe-a26c-e20ddf10d43f\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nwould be amazing to get some sort of similar error prompt that states something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n`\"Operator '>' cannot be applied to types 'Signal' and 'Signal'\"`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nPossibly we could also get an error similar to what happens in the template when we do `@if(sig1)` instead of `@if(sig1())` that looks like `This condition will always return false since signals cannot be compared in this way.

With the ongoing enhancements in Angular, such as the introduction of signals in Angular 17, the framework continues to improve both performance and developer experience. This feature request proposes adding a concise syntax for defining template variables directly within Angular templates, aiming to simplify the referencing of complex expressions, reactive states, and asynchronous data streams.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to introduce a `@define` syntax that allows developers to create aliases or shorthand notations for complex expressions directly within templates:\r\n```\r\n@defined(\r\n  some.component.long.object.path as foo,\r\n  some.component.signal() as bar,\r\n  some.component.async/observable() | async as baz\r\n  ) {\r\n   {{ foo }}\r\n   {{ bar }}\r\n   {{ baz }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new syntax would bring several benefits:\r\n- **Readability**: By replacing complex expressions with descriptive aliases, templates become easier to read and understand.\r\n- **Maintainability**: Centralizes complex expressions, making templates easier to maintain and refactor.\r\n- **Performance**: Minimizes the re-evaluation of expressions, potentially improving change detection performance.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n- **Using Existing Pipes**: Continue using pipes like `async` for asynchronous data. However, this does not address the verbosity of complex expressions or improve template readability.\r\n- **Component Methods**: Implementing methods in component classes that return the required data. While this approach can encapsulate complex logic, it separates the template logic from its context, potentially making templates harder to understand at a glance.\r\n\r\nThis feature request aims to complement the existing mechanisms in Angular by providing a more integrated and intuitive way to handle complex expressions within templates, further enhancing Angular's developer experience.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: Introduce Concise Syntax for Defining Template Variables in Angular Templates\" (#55004)"},{"Id":"2203545065","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-23T00:08:59","Actor":"Ahmed-Hakeem","Number":"55006","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs: add a note about adding other provider configurations as options to @Injectable","State":"open","Body":"Adding this note to expose that user can explicitly define how the service can be called using hooks = or provider configurations that are defined by InjectableProvider type","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55006","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Docs: add a note about adding other provider configurations as options to @Injectable\" (#55006)"},{"Id":"2203214031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-22T19:55:55","Actor":"clydin","Number":"55003","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/language-service): prevent underlying TS Service from handling template files","State":"open","Body":"When the `angularOnly` option is disabled, the underlying TypeScript language service was previously used for all files including `.html` template files.

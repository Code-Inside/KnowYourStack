I might expect this to work:\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"thingAndOther$ | async as {thing, other}\">\r\n```\r\nassuming `thingAndOther$` emits objects that look like `{thing: ... , other: ...}`\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\nHaving an `ngIf`-free way of doing local assignments in templates (see #15280) could reduce the need for this. Following IgorMinar's  comment [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/25351#pullrequestreview-165442868), I might expect it to look like this\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"thingAndOther$ | async as thingAndOther\" #[thing]=\"thingAndOther.thing\" #[other]=\"thingAndOther.other\" >\r\n```\r\n, though that is less convenient than direct destructuring assignment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27555","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support destructuring assignment in *ngIf ... as ...\" (#27555)"},{"Id":"388816835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-07T21:16:35","Actor":"RyanHayden","Number":"27554","RawContent":null,"Title":"service worker fails to load css file","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/service-worker\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> I have not seen a version where this doesn't happen\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nFollowed getting started steps:\r\n\r\n1. npm install -g @angular/cli\r\n2. ng new my-app (selected no to router, used scss)\r\n3. ng add @angular/pwa --project my-app \r\n4. the only update i made to the code was to the styles.scss file adding:\r\n   body { background-color: yellow; }\r\n5. ng build --prod\r\n6. run with http-server\r\n7. create short cut with chrome on desktop version (Version 70.0.3538.110 (Official Build) (64-bit))\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

And sometimes we need the text not the value of it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe solution would be like adding a `.text()` or `.text` to get the selected text value of a reactive form control, so it would be something like, it `<FormControl>` is a drop list normal html `<select>` or even `<mat-select>` for angular material:\r\n\r\n`this.formGroup.get('control').selected.text`\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n`this.formGroup.get('control').text`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCurrently, we add a click event for each `<mat-option>` or `<option>` to return the text value on click.\r\nHere is a [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-w89kwc?embed=1&file=app/app.component.ts).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27534","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding .text() or .selectedOption or .selected.text feature to angular reactive form control drop down list to get the text instead of the value when needed\" (#27534)"},{"Id":"388522989","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-07T06:28:56","Actor":"mralexandernickel","Number":"27533","RawContent":null,"Title":"Change of QueryParam not detected when mutating Array","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄 \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not sure, but the Issue is present for at least one year.

So I have tried : \r\n\r\n`ng update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --migrate-only`\r\n\r\nand I get the following error: `Incompatible peer dependencies found. See above` \r\n\r\n ```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/http\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), wouldinstall \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\nIncompatible peer dependencies found. See above.\r\n```\r\n \r\nSo I tried with `--force` flag and I do get my `package.json` file updated but I never see my `migration.json` schematic run. \r\n\r\n`g update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --force --migrate-only`\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency rxjs @ \"6.3.3\" (was \"6.2.2\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cdk @ \"6.4.7\" (was \"6.4.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/core @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/router @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/common @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure why my `ng update` command is not run. I wanted to test my `migration.json` schematic so I pointed my `collection.json` to point to `ng-update/index` so that when I run `ng add @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration@1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3` I can see if my `ng-update` code work and it does work as expected (Note: this was only to test purpose and I do not intend to use `ng add` to run migrations).

That is needed whenever we need to react to a signal change without needing to use the value of that signal inside the effect. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// log the below message whenever a task is completed (assuming we have a `completedTasksCount` signal)\r\neffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Congratulations on completing the task!!\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nadd `extraDependencies` to [CreateEffectOptions](https://angular.io/api/core/CreateEffectOptions). It will be a list of signals that trigger re-execution of the effect even though they are not used inside the effect.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Congratulation on completing the task!!\")\r\n}, {extarDependencies: [completedTasksCount]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also thought this new option fits best as the last piece that complements what angular currently has:\r\n- automatic tracking of signals used inside the effect\r\n- ability to [untrack](https://angular.io/guide/signals#reading-without-tracking-dependencies) specific signals even though though they are used inside the effect\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n#### Add `dependencies` to [CreateEffectOptions](https://angular.io/api/core/CreateEffectOptions).\r\nThe new option will handle both: untracking of signals used inside the effect and tracking of signals not used inside the effect. When `dependencies` is specified, angular should disable its default behavior and only track signals specified in `dependencies`. I actually think this is a better alternative if the feature is approved for implementation. That's because it provides one API for tracking and untracking as opposed to checking the `extraDependencies` to know what forces re-execution of the effect and checking the effect body to see which signals are wrapped inside `untracked`.\r\n\r\n#### tracked(completedTasksCount)\r\nmuch like there is `untracked(counter)`, add `tracked(counter)` to trigger re-execution of the effect. My problem with it is that it can be called anywhere inside the effect. So, there is no one place to check what forces re-execution of the effect.\r\n\r\n#### Check other frontend libraries/frameworks\r\n- Solidjs [on](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#on): I went to check if solidjs has sth to deal with these use cases and `on` seemed to be the closest thing. To be honest, I didn't quite understand if it solves the same issue, so I'm only mentioning it here in case it's helpful.\r\n- Preact [effect](https://github.com/preactjs/signals#effectfn): seems like it doesn't allow re-execution of the effect unless a signal is accessed.\r\n- Svelte: the `$:` seems to re-execute only when one of the values referenced inside changes\r\n- Qwik [useTask$](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/guides/qwik-nutshell/#usetask----): doesn't run into the problem because it is explicit about what the effect tracks `taskContext.track(() => page.value)`\r\n- React `useEffect`: doesn't run into the problem because it is explicit about what the effect tracks through `dependencies`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50916","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Specify extra effect dependencies without using them inside the effect function\" (#50916)"},{"Id":"1784530945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-02T08:53:15","Actor":"Rajesh-Royal","Number":"50915","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added instructions to include router-outlet in app.component.html","State":"open","Body":"The \"start routing\" readme didn't have the instructions to include `router-outlet` in the `app.component.html` file, and it leads to confusion as the routing did not work even after following the instructions because the `app.component.html` file was missing the `router-outlet`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It also became really slow (I guess it has to do with the same thing due to GC happening more often?)\r\n\r\nI fixed the crash by doing `node --max_old_space_size=8000 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve` but it takes a lot of minutes to actually serve the app. In v15 I didn't have this problem at all and everything was much quicker.\r\n\r\nFor reference, in v15 it always takes about 3 minutes to serve, while on v16 it always takes around 6 minutes (I noticed that half of that is spent on the setup phase)\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSadly I cannot share the project this is happening with. The only thing I did was update from v15 to v16 and update node version from 16.13.1 to v18.16.1\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\n<--- Last few GCs --->\r\n\r\n[28068:0000017002FE5C20]   413291 ms: Scavenge (reduce) 3965.7 (4135.5) -> 3964.7 (4134.5) MB, 4.2 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.130, current mu = 0.050) allocation failure;\r\n[28068:0000017002FE5C20]   415206 ms: Mark-sweep (reduce) 3966.3 (4135.7) -> 3961.5 (4121.9) MB, 1910.4 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.105, current mu = 0.044) allocation failure; GC in old space requested\r\n\r\n\r\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\r\n\r\nFATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\r\n 1: 00007FF75B7CD54F node_api_throw_syntax_error+175743\r\n 2: 00007FF75B752E96 DSA_meth_get_flags+59654\r\n 3: 00007FF75B754BA2 DSA_meth_get_flags+67090\r\n 4: 00007FF75C1FA6E4 v8::Isolate::ReportExternalAllocationLimitReached+116\r\n 5: 00007FF75C1E5A42 v8::Isolate::Exit+674\r\n 6: 00007FF75C06789C v8::internal::EmbedderStackStateScope::ExplicitScopeForTesting+124\r\n 7: 00007FF75C074B7D v8::internal::Heap::PublishPendingAllocations+1117\r\n 8: 00007FF75C071C07 v8::internal::Heap::PageFlagsAreConsistent+3367\r\n 9: 00007FF75C064337 v8::internal::Heap::CollectGarbage+2039\r\n10: 00007FF75C07ACF3 v8::internal::HeapAllocator::AllocateRawWithLightRetrySlowPath+2099\r\n11: 00007FF75C07B59D v8::internal::HeapAllocator::AllocateRawWithRetryOrFailSlowPath+93\r\n12: 00007FF75C083EEA v8::internal::Factory::AllocateRaw+810\r\n13: 00007FF75C09A80A v8::internal::FactoryBase<v8::internal::Factory>::NewFixedArrayWithFiller+90\r\n14: 00007FF75C09AAF3 v8::internal::FactoryBase<v8::internal::Factory>::NewFixedArrayWithMap+35\r\n15: 00007FF75BE593A8 v8::internal::OrderedNameDictionary::Add<v8::internal::LocalIsolate>+968\r\n16: 00007FF75BE59C7C v8::internal::OrderedNameDictionary::FindEntry<v8::internal::LocalIsolate>+1292\r\n17: 00007FF75BE59764 v8::internal::OrderedHashTable<v8::internal::OrderedHashSet,1>::EnsureGrowable<v8::internal::Isolate>+100\r\n18: 00007FF75BD85AF9 v8::internal::CompilationCache::IsEnabledScriptAndEval+5657\r\n19: 00007FF75C297C81 v8::internal::SetupIsolateDelegate::SetupHeap+558193\r\n20: 00007FF75C281227 v8::internal::SetupIsolateDelegate::SetupHeap+465431\r\n21: 00007FF6DCE233A2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 16.1.2\r\nNode: 18.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 7.19.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.1.3\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, material-date-fns-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1601.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    16.1.2\r\n@angular/google-maps            15.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular             16.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Really slow serve time after upgrading from v15 to v16\" (#25483)"},{"Id":"1782712233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-30T18:07:47","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25482","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update webpack to v5.88.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25482","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update webpack to v5.88.1\" (#25482)"},{"Id":"1782682667","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-30T14:58:51","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25481","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): normalize paths in loader cache with esbuild","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based application builder, some plugins may return watch file lists that contain POSIX paths on Windows systems.

script with: \r\n```\r\nwebpack --config webpack.server.config.js --progress --colors\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut webpack doesnt take production configuration into account as fileReplacement is not done when i check `dist/server.js`\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n/* harmony import */ var _src_environments_environment__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__ = __webpack_require__(139);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n/* 139

__webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"environment\", function() { return environment; });\r\n// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.\r\n// `ng build

release fixes a regression in version 0.18.4 where using a TypeScript `namespace` that exports a `class` declaration combined with `--keep-names` and a `--target` of `es2021` or earlier could cause esbuild to export the class from the namespace using an incorrect name (notice the assignment to `X2._Y` vs. `X2.Y`):\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n\n    // Old output (with --keep-names

[`v3.3.0`](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/3.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0)\n\n> **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0\n\n##### 🚀 Improvements\n\n**Method aliases**\n\nNew methods (`glob`, `globSync`, `globStream`) have been added in addition to the current methods (default import, `sync`, `stream`), which eliminate the need to rename the method when importing. In addition, an `async` alias has been added for the default import, which makes it possible to use this packet with ESM.\n\n**Method to convert paths to globs**\n\nA new method (`convertPathToPattern`) has been added in this release to convert a path to a pattern. The primary goal is to enable users to avoid processing Windows paths in each location where this package is used by utilities from third-party packages.\n\nSee more details in the [pull request](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/392).\n\n##### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   In the past, we mishandled patterns that contained slashes when the `baseNameMatch` option was enabled, which went against the documented behavior. ([#&#8203;312](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/312))\n-   Several problems with matching patterns that contain brace expansion have been resolved.  The primary issue solved is when the pattern has duplicate slashes after it is expanded ([#&#8203;394](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/394)), or the `micromatch` package does not correctly generate a regular expression ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/365)).\n-   All negative patterns will now have the `dot` option enabled when matching paths. Previously, the `!**/*` patterns did not exclude hidden files (start with a dot). ([#&#8203;343](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/343))\n-   The issue that led to duplicates in the results when overlapping or duplicate patterns were present among the patterns has been fixed. At the moment, we are only talking about leading dot. Other cases are not included. For example, running with the patterns `['./file.md', 'file.md', '*']` will now only include `file.md` once in the results. ([#&#8203;190](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/190))\n\n##### 📖 Documentation\n\nA [clarifying note](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/blob/master/README.md#concurrency) has been added for the `concurrency` option, which provides more detailed information about the Thread Pool utilization.\n\n##### ⚙️ Infrastructure\n\n-   The benchmark in CI is now running on Node.js 20.\n-   The benchmark now uses the public package [bencho](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/bencho) instead of an in-house implementation. You may want to try this solution for your packages and provide feedback.\n\n##### 🥇 New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;josh-hemphill](https://togithub.com/josh-hemphill) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383)\n-   [@&#8203;mairaw](https://togithub.com/mairaw) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.30.1`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0301-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0300v0301-2023-07-04)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.30.0...v0.30.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   expose .d.ts as cjs version ([#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/253)) ([262e113](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/262e113ee25e9c7d317282b3015102ec932ae2f5))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.49`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90be42511604485f6d78be5d1458ca3aa2083906...fed3738eda530454454a0ca23855f2b1cc84e3b2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90be42511604485f6d78be5d1458ca3aa2083906...fed3738eda530454454a0ca23855f2b1cc84e3b2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

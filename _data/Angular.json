Is that enough to call this a breaking change?\r\n\r\nI'm not certain about this, but I think there might be a similar issue with the `Host` flag and embedded view injectors. I don't see any special handling of the `Host` flag in the `lookupTokenUsingEmbeddedInjector` function, so I assume that if you created a hierarchy like `node -> embeddedView -> node -> embeddedView -> node` and used `@Host` on that last node, it would reach all the way up to the top node (past its \"host\") to find the token it was looking for. I ran out of time to look into this today, but I can take a look next week.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50270","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): fix `Self` flag inside embedded views with custom injectors\" (#50270)"},{"Id":"1707131713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T17:20:29","Actor":"jakovljevic-mladen","Number":"50258","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): labels with links should have the same font weight","State":"closed","Body":"Fix anchor tag styling inside `label.api-status-label` to match font weight of label styling that does not have anchor tag.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

component into WebComponent using `createCustomElement` API from `@angular/elements`\r\nHowever this only creates WebComponent extending `HTMLElement` interface internally.\r\n\r\nWebComponent

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the effect declaration in my code works as follows:\r\nmyEffect = effect(() => {\r\n  // Do something\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nI am proposing an enhancement to allow adding a condition inside the parentheses, so that the effect only triggers when a specific value changes. Here's an example of the suggested syntax:\r\n\r\nmyValue = 4;\r\nmyValue.update((n: number) => n + 1);\r\nmyEffect = effect((myValue: number) => {\r\n  console.log('You just changed me!');\r\n});\r\n\r\nBy implementing this enhancement, it will provide more control over when the effect should execute based on specific conditions.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nThe proposed solution involves modifying the effect declaration syntax to accept a condition within the parentheses. This allows the effect to trigger only when the specified value changes.\r\n\r\nAlternatives considered:\r\nThe current approach:\r\n\r\nmyEffect = effect(() => {\r\n  // Do something\r\n});\r\n\r\nvs.\r\nThe proposed approach:\r\n\r\nmyValue = 4;\r\nmyValue.update((n: number) => n + 1);\r\nmyEffect = effect((myValue: number) => {\r\n  console.log('You just changed me!');\r\n});\r\n\r\nPlease review and consider implementing this enhancement if you find it helpful.

Especially since you're using `MAT_DATE_LOCALE_FACTORY()` -> `inject(LOCALE_ID)`, which is of type `InjectionToken<string>`, and [in your own datepicker example page](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/219c6d0874e568fe55f30bb5538cb4f1c724a836/src/components-examples/material/datepicker/index.ts#L113) you're also using a `string` as `useValue`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI'm getting the `TS2322: Type '{} | null' is not assignable to type 'string | null'.` error, unless I add an `as string` cast.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27087","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DateAdapter): `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` injection-type doesn't support most commonly used `string`\" (#27087)"},{"Id":"1707262357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T09:13:09","Actor":"Mawi137","Number":"27086","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): form field with mat-label and without mat-label not vertically aligned","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhen two mat-form-fields are in a div and one has a mat-label while the other one hasn't, the fields are not aligned vertically.\r\n\r\nThe `display` property on `.mat-form-field` was changed from `inline-block` to `inline-flex`.

When playing around with v15 and density i have noticed that some components seem to not care about the default density defined in my theme.\r\n\r\nA very obvious one is the checkbox which does not care about the default density at all.\r\n\r\nThere are two checkboxes, a default one and an explicitly denser one. In the theme.scss i have set the default theme density to 0.\r\n\r\nA \"denser checkbox\" is wrapped in a div with css-class \"dense\", which is used in theme.scss to include the checkbox-density(-3) explicity.\r\n\r\nGiven i change the theme default density to -3, i expect the default checkbox to shrink to the same size of the explicitly denser checkbox. However the default checkbox stays the same size, ignoring the default density.\r\n\r\nA simple form-field/input however proves that the theme is configured properly, since the input will shrink based on the provided theme default density.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSee a minimal reproduction on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-autocomplete-density-issue-pzrcpe?file=src/theme.scss)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect the checkbox to respect the theme density and shrink accordingly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe checkbox stays the same size no matter what the theme density is.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.2.8\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.8\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-checkbox): checkbox is not affected by theme default density\" (#27085)"},{"Id":"1706907908","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T04:31:45","Actor":"alexfung888","Number":"27084","RawContent":null,"Title":"matieral tab header: pagination controls flickering","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15\n\n### Description\n\nAt some particular widths, the tab header will jump between two states:\r\n\r\n-   display the tab headers with pagination control (ie < on far left and > on far right)\r\n-   display the tab headers without pagination controls\r\n\r\nI cannot make a sample code to show this, but it has already appeared on two of my pages.

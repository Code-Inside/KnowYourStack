But when using standalone components, it's much more frequent, because the import needs to be repeated on every component that needs the directive, and of course we tend to only import what's absolutely needed.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating two relatively small applications to standalone components, I've introduced such a bug, especially with routerLink, at least twice. \r\n\r\nI understand why the compiler doesn't complain, but this, IMHO, is a source of hard to detect bugs: I doubt most people have integration tests checking that each and every link in their components works as expected.

My use-case is that I am on a view with a calendar on a view showing an entire month. Since I am showing a month, picking a day is irrelevant\r\n\r\nTo get around the datepicker going to a day view when clicking on a month, you can add a function that runs on the `(monthSelected)` event and calls `datepicker.close()` when fired. This works, but it flashes the day view for a split second before closing. It should just close right away.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse the example at the very bottom of the official Material docs for the datepicker:\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/examples\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUse this example that uses Angular Material 8.2.3\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/angular/ekjvrbglvnb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdatepicker-views-selection-example.ts\r\n\r\nThe datepicker closes immediately upon selecting a month. \r\n\r\nThis is just one that I found when researching this issue. It is possible that versions later than this also work.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe datepicker switches to the day view and then closes.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25191","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): closing datepicker on monthSelected shows day view briefly\" (#25191)"},{"Id":"1288911449","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-29T15:37:49","Actor":"bonomiandreia","Number":"25189","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(DATAPICKER): Select ranges dates for years and months in only one datapicker.","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nSelect ranges dates for years and months too.\r\n\r\nExample:  if I want only select by years or month, I must NECESSARILY use two date pickers, one for start date and another for end date (I can't add two data pickers in my project).\r\nCurrently, I dont have a choice in angular material to use only one datapicker for the same use (at last, I didn't see this case of use in documentation). \r\nMy suggestion is there is ranges dates for years and months too, as days.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2020 ~ 2022 = 01/01/2020 to 01/01/2022\r\nmay ~ december = 01/05 to 01/12\r\n\r\nNow, I'm moving from library datapicker because this issue.

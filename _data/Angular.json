If not using `ng deploy`, the minimal solution described in \"Manual deployment to a remote server\" implies index.html will be used as-is.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nMake a production build of your nearest Angular application. Edit the generated index.html to remove `type=module`, simulating the experience of a mis-integration.\r\n\r\nRun the application in the browser. Observe console errors. Be sad.\r\n\r\nRetry with a dev build.

Arguing whether or not TestBed is good to use in pure unit tests (not integration tests) is outside the scope of this bug report.\r\n\r\nWhen unit testing components without using TestBed, I instantiate my component instance directly, i.e. `new MyComponent()`. In older versions of Angular, this just worked fine as if your component required any dependencies, those dependencies were made clear in the constructor parameters.\r\n\r\nThen came `inject`, the magical way to hide your dependencies wherever you want to in your code, obfuscating the component's dependencies. At first I fought hard against using `inject` for this reason (which became problematic for things like route guards that should/must be functions now), but I finally figured out how to unit test something that uses `inject` without requiring all of the overhead / breaching the unit boundary of `TestBed` (mostly). https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-test-inject-no-testbed?file=src%2Fapp%2Fadmin.guard.spec.ts%3AL15\r\n\r\nThen I started using signals and effects. I thought I could use the same approach as before, defining a fake injector and using `runInInjectionContext` to wrap the call to `new MyComponent()`. But no dice. My tests fail with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: NullInjectorError: No provider for InjectionToken !\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter looking into it further (requiring a reading of the source code), I found this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/dd8490f384af55e11126fd98be4bf1ad91831057/packages/core/src/render3/reactivity/effect.ts#L254\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst handle = new EffectHandle(\r\n      injector.get(APP_EFFECT_SCHEDULER), effectFn,\r\n      (typeof Zone === 'undefined') ? null : Zone.current, destroyRef, injector,\r\n      options?.allowSignalWrites ?? false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, so I just need to provide a mock value in my unit test for `APP_EFFECT_SCHEDULER`, right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nGoing to definition on that symbol brought me here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/dd8490f384af55e11126fd98be4bf1ad91831057/packages/core/src/render3/reactivity/effect.ts#L46C1-L53C4\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * Not public API, which guarantees `EffectScheduler` only ever comes from the application root\r\n * injector.\r\n */\r\nexport const APP_EFFECT_SCHEDULER = new InjectionToken('', {\r\n  providedIn: 'root',\r\n  factory: () => inject(EffectScheduler),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically this means it is IMPOSSIBLE to mock this, which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to use effects in unit tests without TestBed.\n\n### Please provide a

The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit e75aa9b5818082f2928b777d690027547b62bf9f)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27092","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR

Though I can't find any way to avoid CSS compiler downgrading CSS to equivalent non-nested CSS.\r\n\r\nFor our app, we only support latest browser version, so for us it would be beneficial to use native CSS nesting to make CSS less verbose and builds smaller.\r\n\r\nI tried generating new Angular project with 17.1.3, and setting a `.browserslistrc` (below), but it does not use native CSS nesting.\r\n```\r\nlast 1 Chrome versions\r\nlast 1 Firefox versions\r\nlast 1 Safari major versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/8770194/d2b5315f-cb8f-4cbe-9ddf-8ecde4fe4bd3)\r\n\r\nIf native CSS nesting was used, the above should be something like:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  background-color: steelblue;\r\n\r\n  h1[_ngcontent-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think there's two viable solutions for activating native CSS nesting:\r\n\r\n- Via `.browserslists`, to use native CSS nesting when all selected browsers supports it\r\n- By having a flag in the `angular.json` config to disable nesting plugin for `.css`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a workaround, as far as I know. If I want smaller builds and to make use of modern web features, there's no way to do it when using `.css` without removing the current plugin, which is handled automatically by Angular CLI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27090","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Make native CSS nesting configurable\" (#27090)"},{"Id":"2131538007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T12:16:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27088","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency @typescript-eslint/parser to v7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) ([source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/parser)) | devDependencies | major | [`6.21.0` -> `7.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/6.21.0/7.0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint (@&#8203;typescript-eslint/parser)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.1`](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/HEAD/packages/parser/CHANGELOG.md#701-2024-02-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n### [`v7.0.0`](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/HEAD/packages/parser/CHANGELOG.md#700-2024-02-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v6.21.0...v7.0.0)\n\n##### 🚀 Features\n\n-   ⚠️  bump ESLint, NodeJS, and TS minimum version requirements\n\n-   add support for flat configs\n\n##### ⚠️  Breaking Changes\n\n-   ⚠️  bump ESLint, NodeJS, and TS minimum version requirements\n\n##### ❤️  Thank You\n\n-   Brad Zacher\n-   Kirk Waiblinger\n-   StyleShit\n-   YeonJuan\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.21.0 (2024-02-05)\n\n##### 🚀 Features\n\n-   allow `parserOptions.project: false`\n\n##### ❤️  Thank You\n\n-   auvred\n-   Brad Zacher\n-   Kirk Waiblinger\n-   Pete Gonzalez\n-   YeonJuan\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.20.0 (2024-01-29)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.19.1 (2024-01-22)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.19.0 (2024-01-15)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.18.1 (2024-01-08)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.18.0 (2024-01-06)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27085","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downgrade copy-webpack-plugin to workaround

But when I'm bumping an Angular _minor_ I'm surprised I'm expected by the framework authors to run _migrations scripts_ - because minors shouldn't contain breaking changes. 🤔 \r\n\r\nI've seen the comment: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26349#issuecomment-1809580491\r\n> Latest localtunnel (2.0.2) [is still using](https://unpkg.com/localtunnel@2.0.2/package.json) a vulnerable axios (0.21.4). There's already an issue filed to localtunnel to update the dependency: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel/issues/632. > Until that's fixed, there's not much we can do about this.\r\n> \r\n> browser-sync is only used for live reloading in ng serve and is used in local development only, so the risk here is fairly > minimal.

Specifically, when users attempt to scroll through the options presented in the autocomplete dropdown, the scroll action unexpectedly affects the underlying webpage instead of the dropdown list. This behavior disrupts the user's ability to select an option from the autocomplete list and significantly impacts the usability of the component. The issue has been consistently observed across a variety of devices and web browsers, indicating a broader compatibility or event handling problem within the component.\r\n\r\nVideo Demonstration of the Issue:\r\nhttps://javamaniac.github.io/angular-autocomplete-example/screen-20240212-143204.mp4\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/javamaniac/angular-autocomplete-example\r\n\r\nThe issue with mat-autocomplete scrolling is intermittent and does not have a consistent reproduction sequence. However, it generally involves interactions with the autocomplete component on a mobile device. Below are steps that have sometimes led to the issue, though it may require repeating certain actions or experimenting with the sequence to observe the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential Reproduction Sequences:\r\n\r\nBasic Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nExtended Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Select any option from the list.\r\n3. Clear the selected option (erase the choice).\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options again.\r\n\r\nExternal Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Click outside the dropdown to close it.\r\n3. Re-open the dropdown.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue may not manifest on the first attempt and could require varying the sequence of actions, such as selecting and clearing choices multiple times or opening and closing the dropdown before scrolling attempts are made.

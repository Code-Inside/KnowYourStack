team are looking into moving to Angular.\r\nOur timing seems to be ideal, with the launch of signals, which seem promising.\r\n\r\nComing from MobX which is awesome, signals share several similarities. \r\nWe would like to use signals for a lightweight state management, however the API is limited\r\nFor example, there is no way for someone to \"observe\" a signal and once it changes, to have access to the previous value within the callback.\r\nA similar request was added here for computed.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54339\r\n\r\nI would really like to see something like signal.subscribe(previousValue => {}) in order to avoid any issues or concerns as dicussed in the computed thread\r\n\r\n Inspired by MobX's reaction (which can track multiple observables) \r\nhttps://mobx.js.org/reactions.html#reaction\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce a subscription method to signals where the previous value is available. \r\nThe subscription should return a disposer function, to stop the unsubscription \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCurrently we have added our own workaround, but it has its own limitations, since you need to always pass the same object that wraps the signal in order to function correctly. \r\n\r\n`\r\nexport class SubscriptableSignal<T>{\r\n    private subscribers: ISubscribers<T> = {};\r\n    protected

issue(?)","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nHi all\r\n\r\nBelow is a simplified example of an issue we run into, regarding how computed is functioning.\r\nQuoting the documentation from \r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/signals#computed-signals\r\n\r\n_The doubleCount signal depends on the count signal. Whenever count updates, Angular knows that doubleCount needs to update as well._\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that in order for a computed to re evaluate, one needs to explicitly update the writable signal, the computed is reading.\r\n\r\nHowever, is seems that the computed re evaluates even if any other signal updates that is included in the original one. \r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vt1rc7?file=src%2Fservice.ts,src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Feven.model.ts\r\n\r\nIn the example, although the **events** signal is never explicitly updated nor its reference changed, the **computed re evaluates** in every invocation from setInterval. \r\n\r\nIs such behavior expected, since from the documentation this is not clear at all and may lead to performance issues, if the computed is doing expensive operations.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vt1rc7?file=src%2Fservice.ts,src%2Fmain.ts,src%2Feven.model.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-rc.3...18.0.0)\n\n[Blog post \"Angular v18 is now available\"](http://goo.gle/angular-v18).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### animations\n\n-   Deprecated `matchesElement` method has been removed from `AnimationDriver` as it is unused.\n\n##### common\n\n-   The deprecated `isPlatformWorkerUi` and `isPlatformWorkerApp` have been removed without replacement, as they serve no purpose since the removal of the WebWorker platform.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Angular only supports writable expressions inside of two-way bindings.\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports TypeScript versions older than 5.4.\n\n##### core\n\n-   `OnPush` views at the root of the application need to\n    be marked dirty for their host bindings to refresh. Previously, the host\n    bindings were refreshed for all root views without respecting the\n    `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n-   `OnPush` views at the root of the application need to\n    be marked dirty for their host bindings to refresh. Previously, the host\n    bindings were refreshed for all root views without respecting the\n    `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n-   The `ComponentFixture` `autoDetect` feature will no\n    longer refresh the component's host view when the component is `OnPush`\n    and not marked dirty. This exposes existing issues in components which\n    claim to be `OnPush` but do not correctly call `markForCheck` when they\n    need to be refreshed. If this change causes test failures, the easiest\n    fix is to change the component to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`.\n-   `ComponentFixture.whenStable` now matches the\n    `ApplicationRef.isStable` observable. Prior to this change, stability\n    of the fixture did not include everything that was considered in\n    `ApplicationRef`. `whenStable` of the fixture will now include unfinished\n    router navigations and unfinished `HttpClient` requests. This will cause\n    tests that `await` the `whenStable` promise to time out when there are\n    incomplete requests. To fix this, remove the `whenStable`,\n    instead wait for another condition, or ensure `HttpTestingController`\n    mocks responses for all requests. Try adding `HttpTestingController.verify()`\n    before your `await fixture.whenStable` to identify the open requests.\n    Also, make sure your tests wait for the stability promise. We found many\n    examples of tests that did not, meaning the expectations did not execute\n    within the test body.\n\n    In addition, `ComponentFixture.isStable` would synchronously switch to\n    true in some scenarios but will now always be asynchronous.\n-   Angular will ensure change detection runs, even when the state update originates from\n    outside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\n    detection compared to the previous behavior.\n\n    This change will be more likely to impact existing unit tests.\n    This should usually be seen as more correct and the test should be updated,\n    but in cases where it is too much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the `TestBed` providers.\n\n    Similarly, applications which may want to update state outside the zone\n    and *not* trigger change detection can add\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the providers in `bootstrapApplication` or add\n    `schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly` to the\n    `BootstrapOptions` of `bootstrapModule`.\n-   When Angular runs change detection, it will continue to\n    refresh any views attached to `ApplicationRef` that are still marked for\n    check after one round completes. In rare cases, this can result in infinite\n    loops when certain patterns continue to mark views for check using\n    `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges`. This will be surfaced as a runtime\n    error with the `NG0103` code.\n-   `async` has been removed, use `waitForAsync` instead.\n-   The `ComponentFixture.autoDetect` feature now executes\n    change detection for the fixture within `ApplicationRef.tick`. This more\n    closely matches the behavior of how a component would refresh in\n    production. The order of component refresh in tests may be slightly\n    affected as a result, especially when dealing with additional components\n    attached to the application, such as dialogs. Tests sensitive to this\n    type of change (such as screenshot tests) may need to be updated.\n    Concretely, this change means that the component will refresh *before*\n    additional views attached to `ApplicationRef` (i.e. dialog components).\n    Prior to this change, the fixture component would refresh *after* other\n    views attached to the application.\n-   The exact timing of change detection execution when\n    using event or run coalescing with `NgZone` is now the first of either\n    `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame`. Code which relies on this\n    timing (usually by accident) will need to be adjusted. If a callback\n    needs to execute after change detection, we recommend `afterNextRender`\n    instead of something like `setTimeout`.\n-   Newly created and views marked for check and reattached\n    during change detection are now guaranteed to be refreshed in that same\n    change detection cycle. Previously, if they were attached at a location\n    in the view tree that was already checked, they would either throw\n    `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` or not be refreshed until\n    some future round of change detection. In rare circumstances, this\n    correction can cause issues. We identified one instance that relied on\n    the previous behavior by reading a value on initialization which was\n    queued to be updated in a microtask instead of being available in the\n    current change detection round. The component only read this value during\n    initialization and did not read it again after the microtask updated it.\n-   Testability methods `increasePendingRequestCount`,\n    `decreasePendingRequestCount` and `getPendingRequestCount` have been\n    removed. This information is tracked with zones.\n\n##### http\n\n-   By default we now prevent caching of HTTP requests that require authorization . To opt-out from this behaviour use the `includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders` option in `withHttpTransferCache`.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```ts\n    withHttpTransferCache({\n      includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders: true,\n    })\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   Deprecated `StateKey`, `TransferState` and `makeStateKey` have been removed from `@angular/platform-browser`, use the same APIs from `@angular/core`.\n\n##### platform-browser-dynamic\n\n-   No longer used `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` APIs have been removed.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   deprecated `platformDynamicServer` has been removed. Add an `import @&#8203;angular/compiler` and replace the usage with `platformServer`\n-   deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` has been removed. `TransferState` can be use without providing this module.\n-   deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` been removed from `PlatformConfig`. Provide and absolute `url` instead.\n-   Legacy handling or Node.js URL parsing has been removed from `ServerPlatformLocation`.\n\n    The main differences are;\n\n    -   `pathname` is always suffixed with a `/`.\n    -   `port` is empty when `http:` protocol and port in url is `80`\n    -   `port` is empty when `https:` protocol and port in url is `443`\n\n##### router\n\n-   Guards can now return `RedirectCommand` for redirects\n    in addition to `UrlTree`. Code which expects only `boolean` or `UrlTree`\n    values in `Route` types will need to be adjusted.\n-   This change allows `Route.redirectTo` to be a function\n    in addition to the previous string. Code which expects `redirectTo` to\n    only be a string on `Route` objects will need to be adjusted.\n-   When a a guard returns a `UrlTree` as a redirect, the\n    redirecting navigation will now use `replaceUrl` if the initial\n    navigation was also using the `replaceUrl` option. If this is not\n    desirable, the redirect can configure new `NavigationBehaviorOptions` by\n    returning a `RedirectCommand` with the desired options instead of `UrlTree`.\n-   Providers available to the routed components always\n    come from the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`. This means that providers available only to the\n    component that defines the `RouterOutlet` will no longer be available to\n    route components in any circumstances. This was already the case\n    whenever routes defined providers, either through lazy loading an\n    `NgModule` or through explicit `providers` on the route config.\n-   Providers available to the routed components always\n    come from the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`.

The use of the `isolatedModules` option ensures that TypeScript code can be safely transpiled without the need for the type-checker. This mode of operation has several advantages. The bundler (esbuild in this case) will know have knowledge of the TypeScript code constructs, such as enums, and can optimize the output code based on that knowledge including inlining both const and regular enums where possible. Additionally, this allows for the removal of the babel-based optimization passes for all TypeScript code. These passes are still present for all JavaScript code such as from third-party libraries/packages. These advantages lead to an improvement in build time, especially in production configurations. To ensure optimal output code size in this setup, the `useDefineForClassFields` TypeScript option should either be removed or set to `true` which enables ECMAScript standard compliant behavior.\r\n\r\nInitial testing reduced a warm production build of a newly generated project from ~2.3 seconds to ~2.0 seconds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27752","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(@angular/build): use direct transpilation with isolated modules\" (#27752)"},{"Id":"2325719292","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-30T13:56:36","Actor":"alvaro-b-enguidanos","Number":"27751","RawContent":null,"Title":"flag to run or skip all the optional migrations","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nupdate\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen running `ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18` a prompt appears  asking which migrations  would you like to run.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1131\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/29378422/96364862-b45d-4078-912f-5589423eb78b\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my company the migrations are executed through a CI system, so there are no human interaction.

In this site, I used `mat.define-theme` to create a theme using the `$violet-palette` and everything was working well, except the chip component carried the same style from M2.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of researching, I found that my `angular.json` file includes `prebuilt-themes/ indigo-pink.css` in `styles`, which based on #28779, appears to not have been updated for M3. Switching my import statement to `prebuilt-themes/magenta-violet.css` fixed the issue, and now `mat-chip` has the correct styling.\r\n\r\nI may have just been approaching fixing the problem incorrectly (or perhaps my styling setup is not correct), but I think that mentioning which prebuilt themes work for M3 somewhere in the documentation would be extremely helpful, especially for those upgrading their site to Angular Material v18 from an older version, or for someone starting out!\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-theme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29152","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Mention Importing Prebuilt Themes for M3 Support\" (#29152)"},{"Id":"2323872919","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-30T20:28:24","Actor":"cbaskins","Number":"29141","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tabs): When clicking to another tab prev tab content is destroyed without calling a components onDestroy","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you have a component in a mat-tab as content when that tab is no longer in focused the body is removed but the components onDestroy method is not called.

Disabling it only on inner click and re-enabling it seams like some nasty timing problem (and even looks like [ripple gets removed on mouse down etc.]).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there **really** is a need to be able to disabler the ripple effect for some boxes inside the ripple container. There should either be a directive for disabling it or to make things easy, like I suggested in my previous post, be able to switch from `capture` to `bubbling` so it can be disabled the _vanilla Javascript way_ (`stopPropagation`).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-phk79p-fyt248\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRipple should not show up on clicking some container's child elements.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nRipple cannot be disabled for some inner clicks.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatRipple): MatRipple can not be disabled for child components\" (#29133)"},{"Id":"2321509790","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-28T16:42:41","Actor":"neo-xy","Number":"29130","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(Buttons): Buttons & FABs with support for Icon + label","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAt the moment Buttons and Fabs in documentaion are adjust for containing eaither a label or an icon,\r\nare there any plans to extend api  so icon + label in a Buttons  and FABs can be easily aplied?\r\nAs now that can not be accomplished without adjusting and playing around with the css ;\r\n\r\nEx. of Fab with icon and label that destroys UI:\r\n\r\n`    <button mat-fab (click)=\"drawer.toggle()\">\r\n        <span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" >add</span>\r\n        <span i18n=\"@@sales\">Sales</span>\r\n    </button>`\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(Buttons): Buttons & FABs with support for Icon + label\" (#29130)"},{"Id":"2319892672","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-28T16:31:25","Actor":"F3n67u","Number":"29126","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix deprecated husky install command","State":"closed","Body":"husky v9 deprecated `husky install` command.

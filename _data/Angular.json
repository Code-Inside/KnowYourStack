We can achieve this functionality without having this state tracked inside the Router. Instead, we can re-examine what `ignore` means: We don't want to rerun the matching logic, guards, or resolvers when we already know that nothing is changing.\r\nOutside of the \"navigated\", there are two things that constitute a \"change\":\r\n\r\n1. The browser URL might change. Because of `skipLocationChange`, the browser URL might not always match the internal state of the Router (we can navigate to a path but skip updating the browser URL). If we're navigating to a place that would change the browser URL, we should process the navigation. Theoretically, all we need to really do is update the browser URL instead of processing the whole navigation w/ guards, redirects, and resolvers. But this doesn't matter that much because the default value for `runGuardsAndResolvers` will skip all of this anyways.\r\n2. The internal state of the Router might change. That is, we're navigating to a new path and may or may not be updating the updating the browser URL.\r\n\r\nIf either of the above are true, we process the navigation. If both are false, we aren't changing anything so we can safely ignore the navigation request (as long as `onSameUrlNavigation === 'ignore'`).\r\n\r\nWhy is this change important?\r\n\r\n* Simplification of Router internals. The Router has a lot of special case handling and one-offs to handle a limited set of scenarios. Removing these when possible makes the code easier to follow\r\n* Long term, it would be ideal to make the transitions pipe _not_ modify state outside of itself. That is, it should handle the state of the transition itself and communicate outwards the intermediate events related to the transition. This way, we can investigate extracting the pipe and having the state management code handled elsewhere, in a way that is more conducive to multiple configurations.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48065","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): Remove internal state tracking for browserUrlTree\" (#48065)"},{"Id":"1450096360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-15T16:57:22","Actor":"atscott","Number":"48064","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): Remove unnecessary logic in enabledBlocking option ","State":"open","Body":"The `initNavigated` flag is not necessary.

TypeScript `infer` inside a conditional `extends` ([#&#8203;2675](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2675))\n\n    Unlike JavaScript, parsing TypeScript sometimes requires backtracking. The `infer A` type operator can take an optional constraint of the form `infer A extends B`. However, this syntax conflicts with the similar conditional type operator `A extends B ? C : D` in cases where the syntax is combined, such as `infer A extends B ? C : D`. This is supposed to be parsed as `(infer A) extends B ? C : D`. Previously esbuild incorrectly parsed this as `(infer A extends B) ? C : D` instead, which is a parse error since the `?:` conditional operator requires the `extends` keyword as part of the conditional type. TypeScript disambiguates by speculatively parsing the `extends` after the `infer`, but backtracking if a `?` token is encountered afterward. With this release, esbuild should now do the same thing, so esbuild should now correctly parse these types. Here's a real-world example of such a type:\n\n    ```ts\n    type Normalized<T> = T extends Array<infer A extends object ? infer A : never>\n      ? Dictionary<Normalized<A>>\n      : {\n          [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends Array<infer A extends object ? infer A : never>\n            ? Dictionary<Normalized<A>>\n            : Normalized<T[P]>\n        }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid unnecessary watch mode rebuilds when debug logging is enabled ([#&#8203;2661](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2661))\n\n    When debug-level logs are enabled (such as with `--log-level=debug`), esbuild's path resolution subsystem generates debug log messages that say something like \"Read 20 entries for directory /home/user\" to help you debug what esbuild's path resolution is doing. This caused esbuild's watch mode subsystem to add a dependency on the full list of entries in that directory since if that changes, the generated log message would also have to be updated. However, meant that on systems where a parent directory undergoes constant directory entry churn, esbuild's watch mode would continue to rebuild if `--log-level=debug` was passed.\n\n    With this release, these debug log messages are now generated by \"peeking\" at the file system state while bypassing esbuild's watch mode dependency tracking. So now watch mode doesn't consider the count of directory entries in these debug log messages to be a part of the build that needs to be kept up to date when the file system state changes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Render \"full\" appearance by default. \"minimal\" apperance renders only a checkmark.\r\n\r\nSummary of API and behavior changes:\r\n - Add an `@Input appearance` to pseudo-checkbox with options for \"full\" and \"minimal\".\r\n - mat-option renders \"minimal\" appearance for single-select, which looks like a checkmark.\r\n - Select and autocomplete components display checkmark on selected option.\r\n\r\nWhat's not changing:\r\n - does not affect multiple selection\r\n - mat-option renders \"full\" apperance by default, which is same as existing behavior\r\n\r\nFixes: #25961\r\n\r\n<img width=\"330\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437429-ca42bcf5-76e2-4cf2-8d1f-5cd3731eede9.png\">\r\n<img width=\"295\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437451-06f7a2ca-2890-4e27-b69f-6c0316fcde98.png\">\r\n<img width=\"447\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7720245/201437482-b970a31a-48b3-405c-a802-cf89ceb0b166.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25962","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): add checkmark for single-select\" (#25962)"},{"Id":"1446014982","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T21:21:52","Actor":"zarend","Number":"25961","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/list, material/autocomplete): selected state is visually communicated only with color (WCAG 1.4.1)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nselect visually communicate selected state with color alone.

All the solutions I could find are related to either using an older version of angular than me or using an older version of angular material. This is a new project that was created on angular 14 and was working fine\r\n\r\nI do suspect it might be related to something in Windows Server since is the only difference I can think of. Appreciate any help/suggestions\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** To compile on the server is a requirement by the client, we don't have the people/time/resources to build something to deploy via CI/CD and/or docker, and honestly, is crazy we can't do a simply ng build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to reproduce this problem in another machine\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCreate a build\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild fails with import errors related to scss files/angular material/other files\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.1.1\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows server 2019\r\n\r\n**ng version info:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.1\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.41\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.1\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Angular 14): Error on build loading (SassError + Module Not found)\" (#25959)"},{"Id":"1445519790","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T14:03:31","Actor":"michahell","Number":"25958","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nI can't find specific documentation around Test harness API's for specific components...\r\n\r\non the main test harness documentation page there is an example for a select component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst select = await loader.getHarness(MatSelectHarness);\r\n    await select.open();\r\n    const bugOption = await select.getOption({text: 'Bug'});\r\n    await bugOption.click();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not work similarly for MatAutocompleteHarness:\r\nThere is a `.selectOption()` method which does not accept `{text: string}` but instead only `{selector: string, ancestor: string}` but nowhere this is explained.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/using-component-harnesses","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#25958)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-11-16T03:30:03.2644542Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2393}

The problem is that the `provideServerRendering()` under the hood adds the `provideHttpClient()` call, which effectively overrides any custom configuration of HttpClient, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/06b498f67f2ad16bb465ef378bdb16da84e41a1c/packages/platform-server/src/provide_server.ts#L32\r\n\r\nThis was done for historical reasons to mimic the ServerModule class that imported the HttpClientModule.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to move the `provideHttpClient(...)` *after* the `provideServerRendering()` call.\r\n\r\nSince there is no indication that the configuration was overridden, this leads to hard to debug situations.\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 possible options:\r\n\r\n- Ideally, we should probably drop the `provideHttpClient()` from the `provideServerRendering()` implementation, especially since we merge the client and server configs on the server (in the `app.config.server.ts`). We can only do that in v17 though, since it would be breaking.\r\n- As a possible solution, we can add some dev-mode only code that would use a trick like the one used with `ROUTER_IS_PROVIDED` and output a warning to mention that custom HttpClient configuration was overridden. We can try to do it in the interim before v17.\r\n\r\n// cc @alan-agius4 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50454","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"provideServerRendering() and provideHttpClient() ordering issue \" (#50454)"},{"Id":"1725151487","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T14:41:39","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"50459","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(platform-server): exclude `provideHttpClient()` call from `provideServerRendering()`","State":"closed","Body":"Previously, we've used to have server-specific logic for HttpClient, so there was a need to re-provide it with the right config. Since v16, that logic was refactored and there is no need to re-provide HttpClient anymore.

This is **not** a breaking change, since we've also merge browser application config in the `app.config.server.ts`, so if an application is configured to use HttpClient, it will continue to work on both client and server sides.\r\n\r\nResolves #50454.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(platform-server): exclude `provideHttpClient()` call from `provideServerRendering()`\" (#50459)"},{"Id":"1724945826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T14:40:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"50456","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency https-proxy-agent to v7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [https-proxy-agent](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents) | resolutions | major | [`6.1.0` -> `7.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/https-proxy-agent/6.1.0/7.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.0`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;700)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@6.2.1...https-proxy-agent@7.0.0)\n\n##### Major Changes\n\n-   [`b3860aa`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/b3860aa): Remove `secureProxy` getter\n\n    It was not meant to be a public property.

That actually makes it impossible to use `useClass` or `useFactory` together with `OnDestroy` when there is a dependency which isn't a class.\r\nAn example:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Test implements OnDestroy {\r\n  constructor(private readonly num: number) {\r\n    console.log(this.num);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n    console.log('Test Removed!');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function createTest(num: number): [InjectionToken<Test>, Provider] {\r\n  const token = new InjectionToken<Test>('Test');\r\n  const numToken = new InjectionToken<number>('num');\r\n\r\n  const numProvider: Provider = {\r\n    provide: numToken,\r\n    useValue: num,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const provider: Provider = {\r\n    provide: token,\r\n    useClass: Test,\r\n    deps: [numToken],\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return [token, [numProvider, provider]];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis code will run and work. You can also see there was once a PR that allowed destroy on factory created classes: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/23755.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is there is an error loop. `OnDestroy` won't compile here unless I add `@Injectable` but then I can't use `useClass` with the number dep as it is not known at compile time (Due to `strictInjectionParameters`).\r\nI don't think turning off `strictInjectionParameters` is a good option as it has benefits in other cases. The better idea is allowing `OnDestroy` on all classes regardless of them being decorated or not especially as the runtime allows it.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nClass is using Angular features but is not decorated.

Nothing at all.\r\n\r\n### Exhibit B: Tabs\r\n\r\nPer the [docs](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/api), with **bodyClass**, you can specify \"Classes to be passed to the tab mat-tab-body container. Supports string and string array values, same as ngClass.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you try to pass in a class, as we did with errorPopup above, it will **do nothing**. Same for the *labelClass* specified in the docs: **it's also a red herring that will do nothing**.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can effectively _hack_ material components. You can inspect elements in the browser, find relevant classes, and directly manipulate them. Here's, for instance, how I changed the \"active tab\" css for Material Tabs in my Sign In component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> styles.scss\r\n\r\napp-sign-in .mat-mdc-tab-header{\r\n  // hide the \"active\" underline\r\n  --mdc-tab-indicator-active-indicator-height:0px;\r\n}\r\napp-sign-in .mdc-tab--active{\r\n // make the active tab white\r\n  background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that _maybe_ you can get class-injection to work as specified in the docs, if you're willing to turn off View Encapsulation.\r\n\r\nThis is a sorry way to do things. Surely we can come up with a better way to let users customize Material Components.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nAttempt to add a class to a Material Component, as above.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe classes in my .scss files to be applied to Material Components, when I inject them as specified in the docs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNot a darn thing.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 16.0.0\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.0\r\n@angular/fire                   7.5.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27171","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding classes to material components is fundamentally broken\" (#27171)"},{"Id":"1726511806","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T21:27:08","Actor":"lesteral","Number":"27170","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DatePicker): Date Range validation error","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDate range picker gives wrong feedback \"Invalid end date\"\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. start at [Date range picker forms integration | Datepicker examples | Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms)\r\n2. for Start Date, type \"1/1/2022\", then Tab\r\n3. for End Date, type \"12/31/22\", then Tab\r\n4. so far, so good - see feedback: Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2022-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n5. click in End Date, change to \"12/31/21\" (i.e., end of the previous year)\r\n6. as expected: \"Invalid end date\" - feedback: Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2021-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n7. click in Start Date, change to \"1/1/21\", then Tab into \"End Date\" (no change - still 12/31/21)\r\n8. feedback now (as expected): Selected range: { \"start\": \"2021-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2021-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" }\r\n9. however, **still shows \"Invalid end date\"** - even though the date range should now be valid\r\n10. further, Tab out of End Date, **still** shows \"Invalid end date\" - THIS IS THE ISSUE\r\n11. click in End Date, backspace and re-enter \"12/31/21\" - only now does the error message go away\r\n12. with some similar machinations, one can get \"Invalid start date\", with feedback: \"Selected range: { \"start\": \"2022-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\", \"end\": \"2022-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\" } - i.e., wrong feedback even with good data\r\n![Date range picker forms integration - Invalid end date](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/73240819/3a3d3eaf-e431-49df-a3db-d2ab1873f830)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nno error message\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n\"Invalid end date\"\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome 113.0.5672.134 (Official Build) (64-bit) \r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Chromebook\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DatePicker): Date Range validation error\" (#27170)"},{"Id":"1726443736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-25T20:25:10","Actor":"duane-j-wagner","Number":"27169","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Drag and Drop): autoscroll fails in full size web view","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a hybrid mobile app (Ionic Capacitor) is made with a long list of draggable items, the autoscroll fails to engage.

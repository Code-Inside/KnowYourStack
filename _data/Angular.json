regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI'm having the class variable declaration for an array object as below:\r\n```\r\npublic clients: number[] = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in the `contructor` of the component I'm passing an `UntypedFormGroup` then in the `ngOnInit` setting this `clients` variable value from the form as below:\r\n```\r\nngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.clients = this.form.controls.clients.value\r\n```\r\n\r\n`clients` variable is also bound to a `select` element with `ngModel` two way binding\r\n```\r\n<mat-select multiple [(ngModel)]=\"clients\">\r\n    <mat-option *ngFor=\"let client of clients\" [value]=\"client\">\r\n        {{client}}\r\n    </mat-option>\r\n</mat-select>\r\n```\r\nI use this `select` element to remove items from `clients` array and another input element push new item to this `clients` array\r\n```\r\npublic setNewClient(client: MatAutocompleteSelectedEvent): void {\r\n    this.clients.push(client.option.value)\r\n    this.clientSeachInput = \"\"\r\n    this.setClientAutoCompleteEmpty()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem starts here: Whenever I change the value of `clients` variable it directly gets reflected to 'this.form.controls.clients.value` without calling any set command for it.\r\n\r\nBut if I use the below code on `ngOnInit`\r\n```\r\nngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.clients = new Array().concat(this.form.controls.clients.value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works well and breaks the two way binding of this `clients` variable to the `this.form.controls.clients.value` which is actually makes no-sense to have there a pointer binding.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nIt's my local development environment.\n\n### Please provide the exception

In this particular scenario, we should be using `HttpClientTestingModule` and _not_ providing a service fake.\r\n* Component marble tests section - RxJS is a separate library. Documentation on testing RxJS specifics should not live in Angular docs. \r\n* Component inside a test host section - we now have [`setInput`](https://angular.io/api/core/ComponentRef#setInput), making host components less necessary\r\n* Sections related to router - These sections should use `RouterTestingModule`. `ActivatedRoute` stubs are brittle and _do_ rely on Router navigations to be created appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this page has many test practices that our team would not recommend.

This meant that `onResolve` plugins would not be run for them and esbuild's default path resolver would always be used. This meant that the `inject` feature couldn't be used in the browser since the browser doesn't have access to a file system. This release runs paths passed to `inject` through esbuild's full path resolution pipeline so plugins now have a chance to handle them using `onResolve` callbacks. This makes it possible to write a plugin that makes esbuild's `inject` work in the browser.\n\n-   Add the `empty` loader ([#&#8203;1541](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1541), [#&#8203;2753](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2753))\n\n    The new `empty` loader tells esbuild to pretend that a file is empty. So for example `--loader:.css=empty` effectively skips all imports of `.css` files in JavaScript so that they aren't included in the bundle, since `import \"./some-empty-file\"` in JavaScript doesn't bundle anything. You can also use the `empty` loader to remove asset references in CSS files. For example `--loader:.png=empty` causes esbuild to replace asset references such as `url(image.png)` with `url()` so that they are no longer included in the resulting style sheet.\n\n-   Fix `</script>` and `</style>` escaping for non-default targets ([#&#8203;2748](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2748))\n\n    The change in version 0.16.0 to give control over `</script>` escaping via `--supported:inline-script=false` or `--supported:inline-script=true` accidentally broke automatic escaping of `</script>` when an explicit `target` setting is specified. This release restores the correct automatic escaping of `</script>` (which should not depend on what `target` is set to).\n\n-   Enable the `exports` field with `NODE_PATHS` ([#&#8203;2752](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2752))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATHS` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously it only supported the old `main` field path resolution but did not support the new `exports` field package resolution. This release makes the path resolution rules the same again for both `node_modules` directories and `NODE_PATHS` directories.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.30.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.30.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.29.0...v8.30.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`075ef2c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/075ef2cf315e75b51b671c40ce9a97c66b2e4b50) feat: add suggestion for no-return-await ([#&#8203;16637](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16637)) (Daniel Bartholomae)\n-   [`7190d98`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/7190d98ff40023f24b0c6a98319ae8a82c99ff5b) feat: update globals ([#&#8203;16654](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16654)) (Sébastien Règne)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`1a327aa`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1a327aae57f1b68c96b27cc1bd57f8198d5a3a7c) fix: Ensure flat config unignores work consistently like eslintrc ([#&#8203;16579](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16579)) (Nicholas C.

Previously when bundling with the `file` loader, there was no reference in the metafile from the JavaScript file containing the path string to the copied file. With this release, there will now be a reference in the metafile in the `imports` array with the kind `file-loader`:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       ...\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\": {\n           ...\n         },\n         \"out/entry.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"file-loader\"\n    +        }\n           ],\n           ...\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix byte counts in metafile regarding references to other output files ([#&#8203;2071](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2071))\n\n    Previously files that contained references to other output files had slightly incorrect metadata for the byte counts of input files which contributed to that output file. So for example if `app.js` imports `image.png` using the file loader and esbuild generates `out.js` and `image-LSAMBFUD.png`, the metadata for how many bytes of `out.js` are from `app.js` was slightly off (the metadata for the byte count of `out.js` was still correct). The reason is because esbuild substitutes the final paths for references between output files toward the end of the build to handle cyclic references, and the byte counts needed to be adjusted as well during the path substitution. This release fixes these byte counts (specifically the `bytesInOutput` values).\n\n-   The alias feature now strips a trailing slash ([#&#8203;2730](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2730))\n\n    People sometimes add a trailing slash to the name of one of node's built-in modules to force node to import from the file system instead of importing the built-in module. For example, importing `util` imports node's built-in module called `util` but importing `util/` tries to find a package called `util` on the file system. Previously attempting to use esbuild's package alias feature to replace imports to `util` with a specific file would fail because the file path would also gain a trailing slash (e.g. mapping `util` to `./file.js` turned `util/` into `./file.js/`). With this release, esbuild will now omit the path suffix if it's a single trailing slash, which should now allow you to successfully apply aliases to these import paths.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.8`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1508-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1507v1508-2022-12-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v15.0.7...v15.0.8)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   [`40aa6fe`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/40aa6fe9055f3fe673fda7032c7da8958d3f574d) [#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/253) bump fs-minipass from 2.1.0 to 3.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The intent of the newly-added `--packages=external` setting is to exclude a package's dependencies from the bundle. Since a package's subpath imports are only accessible within that package, it's wrong for them to be affected by `--packages=external`. This release changes esbuild so that `--packages=external` no longer affects subpath imports.\n\n-   Forbid invalid numbers in JSON files\n\n    Previously esbuild parsed numbers in JSON files using the same syntax as JavaScript. But starting from this release, esbuild will now parse them with JSON syntax instead. This means the following numbers are no longer allowed by esbuild in JSON files:\n\n    -   Legacy octal literals (non-zero integers starting with `0`)\n    -   The `0b`, `0o`, and `0x` numeric prefixes\n    -   Numbers containing `_` such as `1_000`\n    -   Leading and trailing `.` such as `0.` and `.0`\n    -   Numbers with a space after the `-` such as `- 1`\n\n-   Add external imports to metafile ([#&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/905), [#&#8203;1768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1768), [#&#8203;1933](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1933), [#&#8203;1939](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1939))\n\n    External imports now appear in `imports` arrays in the metafile (which is present when bundling with `metafile: true`) next to normal imports, but additionally have `external: true` to set them apart. This applies both to files in the `inputs` section and the `outputs` section. Here's an example:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       \"inputs\": {\n         \"style.css\": {\n           \"bytes\": 83,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ]\n         },\n         \"app.js\": {\n           \"bytes\": 100,\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-statement\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        },\n             {\n               \"path\": \"style.css\",\n               \"kind\": \"import-statement\"\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       },\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/app.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"require-call\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"exports\": [],\n           \"entryPoint\": \"app.js\",\n           \"cssBundle\": \"out/app.css\",\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"app.js\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 113\n             },\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 528\n         },\n         \"out/app.css\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"import-rule\",\n    +          \"external\": true\n    +        }\n           ],\n           \"inputs\": {\n             \"style.css\": {\n               \"bytesInOutput\": 0\n             }\n           },\n           \"bytes\": 100\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n    One additional useful consequence of this is that the `imports` array is now populated when bundling is disabled. So you can now use esbuild with bundling disabled to inspect a file's imports.\n\n### [`v0.16.5`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0165)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.4...v0.16.5)\n\n-   Make it easy to exclude all packages from a bundle ([#&#8203;1958](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1958), [#&#8203;1975](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1975), [#&#8203;2164](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2164), [#&#8203;2246](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2246), [#&#8203;2542](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2542))\n\n    When bundling for node, it's often necessary to exclude npm packages from the bundle since they weren't designed with esbuild bundling in mind and don't work correctly after being bundled. For example, they may use `__dirname` and run-time file system calls to load files, which doesn't work after bundling with esbuild. Or they may compile a native `.node` extension that has similar expectations about the layout of the file system that are no longer true after bundling (even if the `.node` extension is copied next to the bundle).\n\n    The way to get this to work with esbuild is to use the `--external:` flag. For example, the [`fsevents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) package contains a native `.node` extension and shouldn't be bundled. To bundle code that uses it, you can pass `--external:fsevents` to esbuild to exclude it from your bundle. You will then need to ensure that the `fsevents` package is still present when you run your bundle (e.g. by publishing your bundle to npm as a package with a dependency on `fsevents`).\n\n    It was possible to automatically do this for all of your dependencies, but it was inconvenient. You had to write some code that read your `package.json` file and passed the keys of the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, and/or `optionalDependencies` maps to esbuild as external packages (either that or write a plugin to mark all package paths as external). Previously esbuild's recommendation for making this easier was to do `--external:./node_modules/*` (added in version 0.14.13). However, this was a bad idea because it caused compatibility problems with many node packages as it caused esbuild to mark the post-resolve path as external instead of the pre-resolve path. Doing that could break packages that are published as both CommonJS and ESM if esbuild's bundler is also used to do a module format conversion.\n\n    With this release, you can now do the following to automatically exclude all packages from your bundle:\n\n    -   CLI:\n\n            esbuild --bundle --packages=external\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        esbuild.build({\n          bundle: true,\n          packages: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          Bundle:   true,\n          Packages: api.PackagesExternal,\n        })\n        ```\n\n    Doing `--external:./node_modules/*` is still possible and still has the same behavior, but is no longer recommended. I recommend that you use the new `packages` feature instead.\n\n-   Fix some subtle bugs with tagged template literals\n\n    This release fixes a bug where minification could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f(x) {\n      let z = y.z\n      return z``\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return y.z``}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(n){return(0,y.z)``}\n    ```\n\n    This release also fixes a bug where using optional chaining with `--target=es2019` or earlier could incorrectly change the value of `this` within tagged template literal function calls:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj?.foo)``;\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo)``;\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    var __freeze = Object.freeze;\n    var __defProp = Object.defineProperty;\n    var __template = (cooked, raw) => __freeze(__defProp(cooked, \"raw\", { value: __freeze(raw || cooked.slice()) }));\n    var _a;\n    var obj = {\n      foo: function() {\n        console.log(this === obj);\n      }\n    };\n    (obj == null ? void 0 : obj.foo).call(obj, _a || (_a = __template([\"\"])));\n    ```\n\n-   Some slight minification improvements\n\n    The following minification improvements were implemented:\n\n    -   `if (~a !== 0) throw x;` => `if (~a) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a | b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a | b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a & b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a & b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a ^ b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a ^ b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a << b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a << b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if ((a >>> b) !== 0) throw x;` => `if (a >>> b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a || !!b) throw x;` => `if (a || b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (!!a && !!b) throw x;` => `if (a && b) throw x;`\n    -   `if (a ? !!b : !!c) throw x;` => `if (a ? b : c) throw x;`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But when looking at the output, it seems as if the useDefineForClassFields is set to true.\r\n\r\nThis setting causes the following example to be compiled/transpiled incorrectly, causing undefined errors:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass XYZ extends W {\r\nprivate readonly whatever = this.query.watch(\r\n    {},\r\n    {\r\n      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',\r\n    },\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly query: GetSomething\r\n  ) {\r\n    super();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar _XYZ = class extends W {\r\n  constructor(query) {\r\n    super();\r\n    __publicField(this, \"query\");\r\n    __publicField(this, \"whatever\", this.query.watch({}, {\r\n      fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n    }));\r\n    this.query = query;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the above example the constructor assignment is done last. I initially thought it was due to esbuild, so I had already opened an issue there which pointed me to the typescript config. (https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2738#event-8030504054)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is correct behaviour from typescript (the wrong order of assignment), or if this just isn't supported anymore?\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere's a typescript example with target: ES2021:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?useDefineForClassFields=true&target=8#code/MYGwhgzhAEAaCaAtaBTAHgFxQOwCYwHVoBvAKAAcAnASwDcwtpKUxcB7bEAT2gHcALBilopK0ALzQM-ahAB0ARwCuornN4Ng-ABSlo+kgF8ANHoNkDBgGYoMWgApsQ1YFwBc0AOTZbvNpQBrAFoObk9TSxMzAEoAblIzYA4IDEolYAx-XUsqOiEmFnZOHmVVDwBxWwBlNgBbWxlsAHMYkjN9CCVyUW04s0NSAYwubuhKjBr66WpmiWgwbC5SXBRQMGZoejECDwWloA\r\n\r\nAnd here's one with ES2022 as target\r\n\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/play?useDefineForClassFields=true&target=99#code/MYGwhgzhAEAaCaAtaBTAHgFxQOwCYwHVoBvAKAAcAnASwDcwtpKUxcB7bEAT2gHcALBilopK0ALzQM-ahAB0ARwCuornN4Ng-ABSlo+kgF8ANHoNkDBgGYoMWgApsQ1YFwBc0AOTZbvNpQBrAFoObk9TSxMzAEoAblIzYA4IDEolYAx-XUsqOiEmFnZOHmVVDwBxWwBlNgBbWxlsAHMYkjN9CCVyUW04s0NSAYwubuhKjBr66WpmiWgwbC5SXBRQMGZoejECDwWloA\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.3\r\nNode: 19.1.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1500.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.3 (cli-only)\r\nrxjs                            7.6.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\nwebpack                         5.75.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"browser-esbuild target set to ES2022 and useDefineForClassFields false not working\" (#24435)"},{"Id":"1496412536","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-14T13:23:52","Actor":"Marius-Romanus","Number":"24433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Option to generate environments when creating a new Angular in versions 15 and higher","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to figure out the real reason for removing the environments in version 15 of the CLI, other than to simplify the configuration (which I'm fine with).\r\n\r\nBut I think it would at least be interesting to have an option (https://angular.io/cli/new#options) when creating a new Angular project to automatically generate the files as before, since in many cases the environments are still used.\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, the autogenerated files are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/environments/environment.ts\r\nsrc/environments/environment.prod.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges when generating angular.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"fileReplacements\": [\r\n         {\r\n          \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n          \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n         }\r\n ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nregards!\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBy default it would be the same as now, but by adding the \"--environments\" flag, it would remain the same as before version 15.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24433","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Option to generate environments when creating a new Angular in versions 15 and higher\" (#24433)"},{"Id":"1496489890","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-14T12:06:47","Actor":"LeonEck","Number":"24434","RawContent":null,"Title":"browser-esbuild can't resolve secondary entry point from library","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI wanted to try the new esbuild based browser builder in a project that contains a library.

Shortly thereafter, I launched a new terminal window and received the error \r\n```\r\n/dev/fd/12:18: command not found: compdef\r\n```\r\n\r\nSearching uncovered a pair of stackoverflows that led to a fix of sorts.\r\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/339954/zsh-command-not-found-compinstall-compinit-compdef\r\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/383365/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories-run-compaudit-for-list\r\n\r\nAdding the two rows in the accepted answer to the .zshrc got further:\r\n```\r\nautoload -Uz compinit\r\ncompinit\r\n```\r\nOn a fresh install of Ventura + Homebrew + Npm from homebrew + angular from npm, this solves the problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may run into further errors if you've installed other brew packages:\r\n \r\n```\r\nLast login: Tue Dec 13 20:18:09 on ttys008\r\nzsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.\r\nIgnore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? ncompinit: initialization aborted\r\n/dev/fd/12:18: command not found: compdef\r\nmscs@max ~ % compaudit\r\nThere are insecure directories:\r\n/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\r\n/usr/local/share/zsh\r\nmscs@max ~ %          \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lead to workaround #2 in the second stack overflow link:\r\n```\r\ncompaudit | xargs chmod g-w\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving write permission from the listed folders appears to have resolved the issue.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.

The default value is `undefined`, implying that either there are no children for the element, or these children are all visible in the UI. Which, in effect, is exactly the same as when the value is `true`. Thus, when the value of `aria-expanded` is anything other than `false`, it is actually equivalent to  `true`.\r\nIn this case, having `null` instead of  `false` results in having  `true` instead of  `false` -- meaning that users get the opposite of the intended information.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that blind users of screen readers are led to believe that the menu is displayed, whereas it's collapsed. This doesn't come from the screen reader actually, but from the browser that populates the accessibility API with the info it is fed with through the HTML code -- which is incorrect here.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Add a button with [matTriggerFor] for a mat menu\r\n<button mat-icon-button\r\n        #menuButton\r\n        [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"exampleMenu\">\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<mat-menu #exampleMenu=\"matMenu\">\r\n2. Inspect the accessibility information of the element in the browser, with the menu collapsed (\"States\" section in Firefox in the Accessibility view. In Chrome, check the Accessibility tab in the Inspector)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn the \"States\" section in Firefox, one item is \"Collapsed\" (no Expanded). In Chrome, the property Expanded is set to false\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn the \"States\" section in Firefox, one item is \"Expanded\". In Chrome, the property Expanded is set to true\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome (not checked but other browsers that follow the spec will show the same behavior)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): not relevant\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26281","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-menu) trigger is setting aria-expanded to null instead of false \" (#26281)"},{"Id":"1499864756","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-16T09:22:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26279","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/menu): aria-expanded not updating in an OnPush component","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the value for `aria-expanded` wasn't being updated when the menu is closed inside an OnPush parent.\r\n\r\nFixes #26262.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26279","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/menu): aria-expanded not updating in an OnPush component\" (#26279)"},{"Id":"1499826331","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-16T08:53:42","Actor":"tchandelle","Number":"26278","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(typography): migration to v15 error with `mat.define-legacy-typography-config` conversion","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen upgrading from v14 to v15, conversion of `mat.define-typography-config()` to `mat.define-legacy-typography-config()` is broken.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

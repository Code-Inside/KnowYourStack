While CDK Portals/Overlays offer a powerful mechanism, they introduce additional complexity: developers must install a separate package, understand PortalOutlet concepts, and often move beyond templates to describe logic imperatively. This makes the ergonomics less intuitive, especially for beginners or for simple use cases where the goal is just “render this content somewhere else in the DOM”.\n\nInspired by Vue's `<teleport>` and React's `createPortal`, this proposal introduces a declarative way to relocate template fragments in Angular, while maintaining clear data flow for the teleported part of the template. It addresses common UI challenges: rendering components outside their parent DOM hierarchy (e.g., modals, popovers, tooltips) to ensure correct stacking context and overlay behavior, while keeping content fully declarative with reactive state and DI.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe feature could be introduced as a core \"teleport\" primitive implemented as a directive. Several implementation strategies are possible:\n1. **as a part of the syntax**\n\t- Behaves similarly to `<ng-container>` (does not create an extra DOM element)\n\t- Could be integrated into the compiler\n2. **explicit import (like [RouterOutlet](https://angular.dev/api/router/RouterOutlet))**\n\t- The directive could be explicitly exported and reused as a composable building block\n\t- Developers could combine it with host directives when creating UI primitives (e.g., popovers, modals, dynamic overlays)\n\nRegardless of the implementation strategy, the core behavior would be:\n- to insert its children into the target element when enabled\n- to insert them to their original location when disabled\n\nTarget resolution is based on a standard CSS selector to select elements directly from the DOM, meaning we do not create any separate placeholders using `<ng-container>` . This is primarily because one of the most common targets is `<body>` , where content needs to escape the root component boundaries (for example, for modals).\n\nTo emphasize that the mechanism directly belongs to the core ecosystem, I’ll use the `ng` prefix in the examples.\n\n### Basic usage:\nA simple ad-hoc modal with animation and proper stacking:\n```html\n<ng-teleport to=\"body\">\n  @if (open()) {\n    <div class=\"modal\" animate.enter=\"fade-in\" animate.leave=\"fade-out\">\n      Modal content\n    </div>\n  }\n</ng-teleport>\n```\n\n### Custom UI elements\nThis example illustrates a very straightforward developer workflow: I create a component — Popover — whose template will be rendered elsewhere in the DOM tree using `<ng-teleport>`. Despite being \"physically\" relocated, the template remains fully declarative: I can control its bindings using reactive state, and nodes inside the template can also inject dependencies via DI.\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-popover',\n  template: `\n    <ng-teleport to=\"body\">\n      @if (open()) {\n        <div class=\"popover\" [style.top.px]=\"y()\" [style.left.px]=\"x()\">\n          <ng-content />\n        </div>\n      }\n    </ng-teleport>\n  `,\n})\nexport class Popover {\n  readonly open = model(true);\n  readonly anchor = input.required<HTMLElement>();\n  readonly x = computed(/* ... */);\n  readonly y = computed(/* ... */);\n}\n```\n\n### Composition\nOne possible way to implement this behavior is through directive composition, assuming the teleport directive is exposed as part of the public API (and it is also expected that we will finally be able to set default values from the host):\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-popover',\n  template: `...`,\n  hostDirectives: [\n    {\n      directive: Teleport,\n      inputs: ['to: teleportTo'], // I’m still really waiting for the ability to set the value at this level\n    },\n  ],\n})\nexport class Popover { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n### Reactive setup \nInspired by other frameworks, we could also bind inputs reactively. For example, the previously mentioned disabled property:\n```html\n<ng-teleport [disabled]=\"isMobile()\" [to]=\"selector()\">\n  ...\n</ng-teleport>\n```\n\n### Ad-hoc implementation\nHere’s a gist: https://gist.github.com/vs-borodin/38e87d0dbbebd7ac0cb6a9eb63e592d6, demonstrating the desired behavior at a basic level, without taking SSR considerations into account.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nTo address content relocation and stacking context issues, we can consider the following alternatives:\n- Since the requested mechanism primarily addresses stacking issues, overflow problems with absolutely positioned elements, as well as the limitations of fixed position when ancestors use CSS transforms, as an alternative we can rely on relatively advanced native solutions (e.g., the `<dialog>` element).\nLimitations: Native elements can cover basic use cases, but for a full-featured UI component in Angular—especially for complex modals or popovers—JS is still required (at least for now).\n- We can also leverage all the capabilities of Angular CDK portals/overlays to achieve the desired result, which, among other things, handles positioning and scroll management for overlays.\nLimitations: Developers might still need to integrate third-party libraries to cover certain scenarios, especially when dealing with stacking context issues—for example, using Floating UI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65903","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Introduce a teleport primitive for moving template fragments\" (#65903)"},{"Id":"3702884861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-07T02:47:27","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"65902","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): fix hideCopy option to code snippets","State":"open","Body":"Adds the ability to hide the copy button on code snippets.\r\n\r\nUpdates documentation to use the new `hideCopy` option with the new markdown code fence syntax.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

If so, would it be possible to opt them out with existing framework functionality?\n\nOne thing about reactive forms adopting signals internally is that the signal graph in the devtools has so much noise from internal signal state. This internal change was made before the signal devtools, but I was curious if something like this would inherit showing all those internal properties. To be honest the noise in reactive forms in particular makes it hard to see application signals, and upon seeing this PR I have some concern if this will add more noise.\n\nFor example, check out this reproduction: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-1mfuv5ek?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n## Example: one user signal vs different basic reactive form signal internals\n\n```ts\n// Reproduction also includes a form group with a control and the relatively new form array with a control\n// Can comment out individually to isolate + scale\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <p>{{applicationSignal()}}</p>\n\n    <input [formControl]=\"reactiveFormControl\" />\n  `,\n  imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],\n})\nexport class App {\n  applicationSignal = signal('application signal value');\n\n  reactiveFormControl = new FormControl('form control value');\n}\n```\n\n<img width=\"205\" height=\"196\" alt=\"Signal graph of one application signal and 6 internal form signals\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2cee24-713e-4f73-b5bb-5fca52c2baaa\" />\n\nAs you can see, the one user written signal is a fraction of the six internal framework signals used for a form control.\n\n| Form class type | Internal signals |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 `FormControl` (FC) |  6 |\n| 1 `FormGroup` with 1 FC | 14 |\n| 1 `FormArray` with 1 FC | 14 | \n\nAll versus a single user written signal. I do reactive forms all day and even a single control or small group could out-scale most signals I write myself in a component.\n\nMy concern is that as more signals are used internally, that it becomes harder to see my application's signals. It is already an issue IMO with reactive forms.\n\n### Proposed solution [Feature Request only]\n\nFour options I think could all have advantages\n\n- Existing convention: Be able to filter out framework signals, akin to \"Hide Framework Injectors\" in the Injector Tree\n- Most out of sight of user: Perhaps just not even show them? This usage of signals internally in forms predates the signal devtools, but I mention this now since it looks like more signals will be used internally in existing APIs. \n- Distinction: Place internal signals in a different cluster than application signals, or with different shapes/colors. Tbh to me this sounds reaching and plausibly just as confusing, but it came to mind.\n- Potentially radical: [\"Compound signals\" visualization](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63227). Like how the resource visualizer PR linked in that issue is like.  I do think it could be cool and useful to see internal signals, but I imagine that could be confusing and a lot of work. But I thought at least for reactive forms that it would be cool to see values in the tree in a condensed way, though I know that API in particular has nuances in those values that may not be applicable/accurate timing for users.\n\n### Alternatives considered [Feature Request only]\n\nUse other parts of the devtooling or continue panning around to find my authored signals.

As I previously suggested, making the type `any` would solve this issue. The FormUiControl shouldn't care about what type the pre-transform value is or how the transformer is implemented, only that the post-transform value is boolean - thus `any` can be used instead of `unknown` to allow for type-strict transformers (such as `string | boolean` -> `boolean`).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\nEdit: Reproduction in the original Issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nProperty 'readonly' in type 'CustomInputComponent' is not assignable to the same property in base type

This microtask scheduling is to ensure patterns such as `Promise.resolve().then(() => updateAppStateAgain())` _during_ synchronization are caught and synchronized again within the same event loop (guaranteeing that they aren't split across multiple browser paints).\r\n\r\nThe microtask scheduler should be used after any tick, not just from those than run within the scheduler to always account for the promises within synchronization. This is encountered most frequently during bootstrap, which triggers the tick directly.\r\n\r\nIn this change we exempt `TestBed.tick` and\r\n`ComponentFixture.detectChanges` from this behavior. Doing so would affect the timing of stability and tests are quite sensitive to this (e.g. `fixture.whenStable`). It is somewhat unfortunate that we have \"special\" test-only behavior. However, it is important to acknowledge that this only affects the test-only APIs as well. Any code in the application under test that triggers `ApplicationRef.tick` directly would still use the microtask scheduling behavior.\r\n\r\nfixes #65444\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/65885","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): Microtask scheduling should be used after any application synchronization\" (#65885)"},{"Id":"3700166662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T19:46:43","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"65884","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Updates tutorial syntaxis highlight","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

this bug was not present was\n\n20.3.12\n\n### Description\n\nWhen updating my app to Angular 21, all is fine, _except_ my unit tests. There are now many, many occurrences of the `NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`, which were not present before the update.\n\nMy app still heavily relies on zone.js for change detection. I also still use the older `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma` builder. I am working on upgrading both, but that process is gradual and will still take significant effort.\n\nI discovered [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/angular/comments/1p8suok/upgrading_from_angular_20_21_app_works_but_tests/) where someone describes the exact same issue (in way more detail). This also includes a workaround: globally \"patch\" `TestBed.configureTestingModule` to always `provideZoneChangeDetection()`. As I also indicated in my comment over there, this does work, but feels too hacky and I cannot imagine this being the \"official\" recommended solution. Is there anything else I can do?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nIn principle:\n1. Have a zone.js-based Angular project, not using OnPush change detection (at least not everywhere)\n2. Run `ng test`\n3. Observe NG0100 errors\n\nI am unfortunately unable to submit (parts of) my actual source code.

This allows us to deliver portable docker images that can be deployed under different paths in different environments by simply setting the `BASE_HREF` environment variable.\n\nSo when building our app, we set `baseHref` in the build config to a string like `${BASE_HREF}`.\n\nWith Angular 20.3.11, this produced the following tag in `index.html` (with a localized build):\n\n```html\n<base href=\"${BASE_HREF}/en/\"/>\n```\n\nSince Angular 20.3.13, we now get a leading slash added:\n\n```html\n<base href=\"/${BASE_HREF}/en/\"/>\n```\n\nFor deployments where our `BASE_HREF` value is an empty string, this results in the base href value of `//en/` which is a protocol-relative URL and so all of our resources fail to load.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular app with 20.3.13, set baseHref to a value that does not start with `/`, enable localization, build.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.13\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.15\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.13\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.13\n@angular/build               20.3.13\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.14\n@angular/cli                 20.3.13\n@schematics/angular          20.3.13\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.9.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32030","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Leading slash added to baseHref\" (#32030)"},{"Id":"3698454359","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T17:16:11","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"32040","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): ensure locale base href retains leading slash","State":"closed","Body":"When baseHref is provided, getLocaleBaseHref was incorrectly adding a leading slash from the joined path.

[`v0.27.1`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0271)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.27.0...v0.27.1)\n\n- Fix bundler bug with `var` nested inside `if` ([#&#8203;4348](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4348))\n\n  This release fixes a bug with the bundler that happens when importing an ES module using `require` (which causes it to be wrapped) and there's a top-level `var` inside an `if` statement without being wrapped in a `{ ... }` block (and a few other conditions). The bundling transform needed to hoist these `var` declarations outside of the lazy ES module wrapper for correctness. See the issue for details.\n\n- Fix minifier bug with `for` inside `try` inside label ([#&#8203;4351](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4351))\n\n  This fixes an old regression from [version v0.21.4](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.21.4). Some code was introduced to move the label inside the `try` statement to address a problem with transforming labeled `for await` loops to avoid the `await` (the transformation involves converting the `for await` loop into a `for` loop and wrapping it in a `try` statement). However, it introduces problems for cross-compiled JVM code that uses all three of these features heavily. This release restricts this transform to only apply to `for` loops that esbuild itself generates internally as part of the `for await` transform. Here is an example of some affected code:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  d: {\n    e: {\n      try {\n        while (1) { break d }\n      } catch { break e; }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  a:try{e:for(;;)break a}catch{break e}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  a:e:try{for(;;)break a}catch{break e}\n  ```\n\n- Inline IIFEs containing a single expression ([#&#8203;4354](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4354))\n\n  Previously inlining of IIFEs (immediately-invoked function expressions) only worked if the body contained a single `return` statement. Now it should also work if the body contains a single expression statement instead:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  const foo = () => {\n    const cb = () => {\n      console.log(x())\n    }\n    return cb()\n  }\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  const foo=()=>(()=>{console.log(x())})();\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  const foo=()=>{console.log(x())};\n  ```\n\n- The minifier now strips empty `finally` clauses ([#&#8203;4353](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4353))\n\n  This improvement means that `finally` clauses containing dead code can potentially cause the associated `try` statement to be removed from the output entirely in minified builds:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  function foo(callback) {\n    if (DEBUG) stack.push(callback.name);\n    try {\n      callback();\n    } finally {\n      if (DEBUG) stack.pop();\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Old output (with --minify --define:DEBUG=false)\n  function foo(a){try{a()}finally{}}\n\n  // New output (with --minify --define:DEBUG=false)\n  function foo(a){a()}\n  ```\n\n- Allow tree-shaking of the `Symbol` constructor\n\n  With this release, calling `Symbol` is now considered to be side-effect free when the argument is known to be a primitive value. This means esbuild can now tree-shake module-level symbol variables:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  const a = Symbol('foo')\n  const b = Symbol(bar)\n\n  // Old output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n  const a = Symbol(\"foo\");\n  const b = Symbol(bar);\n\n  // New output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n  const b = Symbol(bar);\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rolldown/rolldown

Previously, the system treated most command failures generically, often assuming a package was simply \"not found.\" This could mask the true root cause of issues such as network failures, registry authentication errors, or unexpected changes in a package manager's output.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation enhances diagnostics and provides clearer, more actionable error messages by:\r\n- Introducing a standardized `ErrorInfo` interface to represent parsed error details.\r\n- Adding dedicated parsers to extract structured error information (JSON or text-based) from the stderr of npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun.\r\n- Making the core execution logic stricter. It now re-throws the original `PackageManagerError` if a command fails for an unknown reason, preventing silent failures.\r\n- Abstracting the \"package not found\" check into the `PackageManagerDescriptor`, removing hardcoded logic from the execution layer.\r\n- Improving the `yarn-classic` parser to use verbose logs, allowing it to accurately detect and report specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 401, 403, 404, 500).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32029","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): implement structured error handling in package manager API\" (#32029)"},{"Id":"3694981007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T10:49:34","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"32028","RawContent":null,"Title":"Serve Angular Application with ngrok","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI was using ngrok to serve an Angular app in a remote link but without the configuration in the Angular.json I get an error related to vite configurations.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI don't know if there's a section in the documentation dedicated to this scenario.

Ensure that the viewport is scrollable in your CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\ncdk-virtual-scroll-viewport {\r\n  height: 600px;\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated to #10122.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32487","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add virtual scrolling support to tables\" (#32487)"},{"Id":"3698227028","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-05T09:40:43","Actor":"ErsinCabuk","Number":"32486","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(Dialog): animate.leave","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWhen you use the if control flow or ViewContainerRef.createComponnt in Angular, animate.enter and animate.leave work.

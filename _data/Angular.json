In some setups, `ngcc` is invoked in the `postinstall` script of the `package.json`. When updating Angular, in scenarios where `postinstall` is run (e.g. Nx migrations), this throws an error before a migration can remove the `ngcc` invocation. This makes the update process to be more complicated.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n`ngcc` is available as a no-op operation. When invoked, it will warn, providing details about removing `ngcc`. It gives some context at the tool level to folks who haven't caught up with news that `ngcc` was removed.\r\n\r\n**Note:** In Angular 17, this will be removed.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI chose to inline some slightly modified functionality from chalk for the colors in the console.

Be able to reference another target in a custom build target similar to what we can do in the `serve` target right now.\r\n```\r\n  projects: {\r\n    project: {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\":  \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n           \"configurations: {\r\n             \"production\": {...},\r\n             \"development\": {...}\r\n           }\r\n         },\r\n        \"build-esbuild\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"project:build:production\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"development\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"project:build:development\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrent solutions that I am aware of: \r\n\r\n1. Create another project in the workspace that uses `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild` as builder for the `build` target. \r\nBuild can be invoked with `ng build <project>` then.\r\n2. Add a new target (e.g. `build-esbuild`) to the current project that uses `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild` as builder. \r\nBuild can be invoked with `ng run <project>:build-esbuild` then.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions require us to replicate the build config.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25087","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Easily and continuously experiment with esbuild-based builder\" (#25087)"},{"Id":"1686589563","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T12:52:38","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25085","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: replace `node` with `process.execPath`","State":"closed","Body":"This is ensure that the same node executable is used to spawn Jest\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25085","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: replace `node` with `process.execPath`\" (#25085)"},{"Id":"1686413726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T12:26:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"25082","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(@angular-devkit/build-angular): do not inline sourcemap when using vite dev-server","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nVite inlines the source map as part of content (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/ba62be40b4f46c98872fb10990b559fee88f4a29/packages/vite/src/node/server/send.ts#L59-L63) with no option to disable this behaviour.

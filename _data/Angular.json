Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nIn Server-Side Rendering (SSR) scenarios with Event Replay enabled, the `setStashFn` callback in [packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts](cci:7://file:///c:/Angular/angular/packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts:0:0-0:0) creates a closure that retains references to DOM elements (via `jsActionMap`).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the cleanup function (`clearStashFn`) is only scheduled to execute when the application is destroyed (`appRef.onDestroy`). This means that elements captured during the hydration phase are pinned in memory for the entire lifetime of the application, causing a memory leak. This is particularly noticeable when components are destroyed (e.g., via `*ngIf`), but their DOM nodes remain referenced by the event replay stash.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #66506\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe fix adjusts the timing of the cleanup in [packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts](cci:7://file:///c:/Angular/angular/packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts:0:0-0:0).\r\n\r\nInstead of waiting for the application to be destroyed, we now invoke `clearStashFn()` as soon as the application becomes **stable** using `appRef.whenStable()`.\r\n\r\n- **Why this works**: The \"stable\" state signalizes that the initial hydration process is complete. At this point, Angular has taken over the page, and the temporary event stashing mechanism used for replay is no longer needed.\r\n- **Impact**: Clearing the stash function immediately after stability ensures that the references to the DOM elements are released early. This allows the JavaScript engine's garbage collector to correctly reclaim memory for elements and components as they are destroyed during the application's lifecycle, fixing the leak.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n**Files changed:**\r\n- [packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts](cci:7://file:///c:/Angular/angular/packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts:0:0-0:0) - Updated [withEventReplay](cci:1://file:///c:/Angular/angular/angular/packages/core/src/hydration/event_replay.ts:68:0-204:1) to call `clearStashFn()` on `whenStable()` instead of `onDestroy`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66627","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): prevent event replay from retaining elements with listeners\" (#66627)"},{"Id":"3827154969","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-18T18:53:22","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"66626","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): drop .tsx extension for generated relative imports","State":"open","Body":"When synthesizing an import corresponding with a .tsx file, the extension would not be removed unlike regular .ts files.

Description\n\nTo my best understanding the only way to print an error message in the HTML template is to pass a number as the index of array returned by

be possible to add something similar to [hasError](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControl#hasError) method from FormControl so that the error messages would not be accessed via \"magic

sub-section headings","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nHi,\n\nI'm a blind programmer and screen reader user.\n\nReading documentation on angular.dev, I see that, for each sub-section heading, there is something like:\n\n```\n<h2 id=\"resource-loaders\">\n  <a\n    href=\"#resource-loaders\"\n    class=\"docs-anchor\"\n    tabindex=\"-1\"\n    aria-label=\"Link to Resource loaders\">\n      Resource loaders\n      <docs-copy-link-button\n        mattooltipposition=\"above\"\n        class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger\"\n        _nghost-ng-c2302112746=\"\"\n        aria-label=\"Copy link to Resource loaders\">\n        <docs-icon\n          _ngcontent-ng-c2302112746=\"\"\n          aria-hidden=\"true\"\n          translate=\"no\"\n          class=\"material-symbols-outlined\"\n          _nghost-ng-c1001676203=\"\"\n          ng-version=\"21.1.0+sha-ded654d\">\n            link\n        </docs-icon>\n      </docs-copy-link-button>\n  </a>\n</h2>\n```\n\nEven it's not so easy to point to a single, clear, authoritative resource about it, this is incorrect for various reasons:\n\n- `<a>` tag contains text, perfectly retrievable by screen readers, but has also an aria-label;\n- the label for `<a>` is prefixed with \"Link to\", but aria-label should not provide role info, and `<a>` tag is already exposed by browsers to screen readers as a link (so the current label just duplicates the role reporting);\n- aria-label on `<a>` hides completely the nested pseudo-button and icon (latter is hidden with aria, anyway, so ok);\n- the `<docs-copy-link-button>` pseudo-button, in addition to its aria-label, should be marked with `role=\"button\"`;\n- (optional) aria-label for `<docs-copy-link-button>` could be shorter and more generic, like \"Copy section link\", to reduce verbosity (second reading of section title after one provided by `<a>` content).\n\nTo sumarize: aria-label attribute and its value on `<a>` tag is useless and counterproductive, `<docs-copy-link-button>` has to be marked with `role=\"button\"` and its label could be improved.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\ne.g.:

Please add an explicit Angular decorator.`\n\nThis happens even when:\n\n- the project is not Angular\n- there are no Angular decorators\n- the library is built with @nx/js:tsc\n- ESLint rules are disabled\n- the file is not part of any Angular compilation\n\nThe error disappears immediately when the Angular Language Service extension is disabled, confirming ALS as the source.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66598","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Language Service flags non-Angular TypeScript classes by method name (ngOnInit) in Nx monorepo\" (#66598)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3823984937","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T23:21:27","Actor":"amishne","Number":"32318","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): Remove nonexistent link from MCP response","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32318","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular/cli): Remove nonexistent link from MCP response\" (#32318)"},{"Id":"3823686320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T21:16:32","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32317","RawContent":null,"Title":"Several circular dependency fixes","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32317","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Several circular dependency fixes\" (#32317)"},{"Id":"3823569891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T20:29:58","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32316","RawContent":null,"Title":"Additional isolated declarations build fixes","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32316","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Additional isolated declarations build fixes\" (#32316)"},{"Id":"3823544573","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T20:22:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32315","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): support `isolatedDeclarations` for tree classes","State":"open","Body":"This commit refactors several Tree implementations (`DelegateTree`, `HostTree`, `NullTree`, `ScopedTree`) to support the TypeScript `isolatedDeclarations` compiler option.

Non the less, I am concerned that these will soon be removed, since the AMD version is deprecated, and we will no longer be able to use monaco with angular.\n\nAfter managing this problems, I was testing the built code and it seams the generated minified code does not match the development code and breaks.\n\nThis is the original monaco code:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n    for await(const item of this._asyncIterable) {\n        if (item) {\n            this._result.push(item);\n            this._fireResult(options);\n        }\n    }\n    this._asyncIterableDone = true;\n    if (this._state === 3 /* HoverOperationState.WaitingForAsync */\n    || this._state === 4 /* HoverOperationState.WaitingForAsyncShowingLoading */\n    ) {\n        this._setState(0 /* HoverOperationState.Idle */\n        , options);\n    }\n} catch (e) {\n    onUnexpectedError(e);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the unminified generated code:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n  try {\n    for (var iter = __forAwait(this._asyncIterable), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = yield iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n      const item = temp.value;\n      if (item) {\n        this._result.push(item);\n        this._fireResult(options);\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (temp) {\n    error = [temp];\n  } finally {\n    try {\n      more && (temp = iter.return) && (yield temp.call(iter));\n    } finally {\n      if (error)\n        throw error[0];\n    }\n  }\n  this._asyncIterableDone = true;\n  if (this._state === 3 || this._state === 4) {\n    this._setState(0, options);\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  onUnexpectedError(e);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the minified code:\n```ts\ntry {\n    try {\n        for (var t = fs(this._asyncIterable), i, n, s; i = !(n = yield t.next()).done; i = !1) {\n            let r = n.value;\n            r && (this._result.push(r),\n            this._fireResult(e))\n        }\n    } catch {\n        s = [n]\n    } finally {\n        try {\n            i && (n = t.return) && (yield n.call(t))\n        } finally {\n            if (s)\n                throw s[0]\n        }\n    }\n    this._asyncIterableDone = !0,\n    (this._state === 3 || this._state === 4) && this._setState(0, e)\n} catch (r) {\n    ye(r)\n}\n```\n\nThere is an important difference between the development code and production code:\n```ts\ncatch {\n    s = [n]\n}\n\ncatch (temp) {\n  error = [temp];\n}\n```\n\nThe `n` variable is never assigned and is undefined, giving an error later on in the code.\n\nCan we also address the fact *.css files are correctly loaded with vite in the development server and not using the application builder? The css is bundled but there is no code importing it.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Install monaco-editor\n2. Build the application in production,\n3. Check the generated chunks.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _

Create a new Angular project:\n`ng new junction-repro`\n`cd junction-repro`\n\n2. Enable symlink preservation:\nadd `\"preserveSymlinks\": true` in angular.json\n\n3. Create a Windows junction pointing to the project directory:\n`mklink /J C:\\temp\\junction-repro C:\\realpath\\junction-repro`\n\n4. Open the project via the junction path:\n`cd C:\\temp\\junction-repro`\n`ng serve`\n\n5. Open the application in the browser.\n\n\nsee also #27119 for a setup with Dev Drives\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nThere is no error shown.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.5\nAngular           : 21.0.8\nNode.js           : 24.11.0\nPackage Manager   : npm 11.6.1\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n┌───────────────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│ Package                   │ Installed Version │ Requested Version │\n├───────────────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┤\n│ @angular/build            │ 21.0.5            │ ^21.0.5           │\n│ @angular/cli              │ 21.0.5            │ ^21.0.5           │\n│ @angular/common           │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler         │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/compiler-cli     │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/core             │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/forms            │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/platform-browser │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ @angular/router           │ 21.0.8            │ ^21.0.0           │\n│ rxjs                      │ 7.8.2             │ ~7.8.0            │\n│ typescript                │ 5.9.3             │ ~5.9.2            │\n│ vitest                    │ 4.0.17            │ ^4.0.8            │\n└───────────────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThe issue does not occur when:\n- running the same project from its real filesystem path\n- switching to the webpack builder:\n`\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\"`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32306","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve / ng build does not work with windows junctions\" (#32306)"},{"Id":"3816648122","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:07:20","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"32304","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): ensure the JIT compiler is available for Vitest tests that use providersFile.","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #31993\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nGiven how impossible it is in npm to exclude a transitive dependency, there is good reason for the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to be a peer dependency.\n\n- It is for an experimental feature (see docs at https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3f13db87e27f6ffc207fc642979776606a71fcec/adev/src/content/ai/develop-with-ai.md?plain=1#L34C1-L34C41).\n- It involves code to start a local server so is inherently more risky.\n- It requires specific setup outside of the Angular CLI (a given local AI tool needs the MCP endpoint configuring)\n\nPlease change this so that we reduce bloat and security related overhead unless we choose to actually use it.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nnpm audit -> mcp related CVEs fail a check despite it not being used\n\n\n\n### Exception or

This adapter enables Material datepicker to work with Temporal (native or polyfilled) without relying on JS `Date` as the internal model. The implementation follows patterns from existing adapters in this repo, especially `NativeDateAdapter`.\r\n\r\n## Scope / what’s in this PR\r\n- **Unified adapter**: `TemporalDateAdapter` with `mode`:\r\n  - `date` → `Temporal.PlainDate`\r\n  - `datetime` → `Temporal.PlainDateTime`\r\n  - `zoned` → `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`\r\n- **Split adapters** for API ergonomics:\r\n  - `PlainTemporalAdapter` with `mode: 'date' | 'datetime'` (PlainDate + PlainDateTime)\r\n  - `ZonedDateTimeAdapter` with configurable `timezone`\r\n- **Formatting** uses `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` with Temporal’s locale formatting.\r\n- **No runtime dependency** is added; consumers supply a Temporal implementation (native or polyfill).\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n### Unified adapter (`TemporalDateAdapter` / `MatTemporalDateAdapterOptions`)\r\n**Defaults**\r\n- `calendar`: `iso8601`\r\n- `outputCalendar`: same as `calendar`\r\n- `mode`: `date`\r\n- `overflow`: `reject`\r\n- `timezone`: system timezone (only when `mode: 'zoned'`)\r\n- `disambiguation`, `offset`, `rounding`: Temporal defaults (only when `mode: 'zoned'`)\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\n- `calendar`: calendar system to use for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar`: calendar system to use for output/formatting when different from calculations (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDate/withCalendar, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/withCalendar).\r\n- `mode`: `date | datetime | zoned`.\r\n- `timezone` (zoned only): IANA ID like `Europe/Warsaw` or `UTC`.\r\n- `disambiguation` (zoned only): `'compatible' | 'earlier' | 'later' | 'reject'` for DST gaps/overlaps (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDateTime/toZonedDateTime, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `offset` (zoned only): `'use' | 'ignore' | 'reject' | 'prefer'` for offset ambiguity on parse (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `rounding` (zoned only): `{smallestUnit, roundingIncrement?, roundingMode?}` applied to zoned output (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/round).\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek`: overrides the locale-derived week start.\r\n- `overflow`: `reject` throws on invalid dates, `constrain` clamps to the nearest valid date.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n- `outputCalendar` uses `withCalendar` for display fields only; it does not re-resolve the instant, so `disambiguation`/`offset` are not applied during output conversion.\r\n- If `disambiguation`, `offset`, or `rounding` aren’t provided, the adapter relies on Temporal’s defaults.\r\n- `overflow` defaults to `reject` to avoid silent clamping and better match strict validation expectations.\r\n\r\n### Split adapters\r\n**`PlainTemporalAdapterOptions`** (for `PlainTemporalAdapter`)\r\n- `mode` (default: `datetime`): `date` → `PlainDate`, `datetime` → `PlainDateTime`.\r\n- `calendar` (default: `iso8601`): calendar system for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar` (default: same as `calendar`): calendar system for output/formatting.\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek` (default: locale-derived): overrides the locale-derived week start.\r\n- `overflow` (default: `reject`): `reject` throws on invalid dates, `constrain` clamps.\r\n\r\n**`ZonedDateTimeAdapterOptions`** (for `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`)\r\n- `calendar` (default: `iso8601`): calendar system for calculations.\r\n- `outputCalendar` (default: same as `calendar`): calendar system for output/formatting (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/withCalendar).\r\n- `timezone` (default: system timezone): IANA ID like `Europe/Warsaw` or `UTC`.\r\n- `disambiguation`: `'compatible' | 'earlier' | 'later' | 'reject'` for DST gaps/overlaps (MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/PlainDateTime/toZonedDateTime, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/ZonedDateTime/from).\r\n- `offset`: `'use' | 'ignore' | 'reject' | 'prefer'` for offset ambiguity on parse

provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date', calendar: 'iso8601', outputCalendar: 'japanese'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2024-01-15');\r\n  // Output example: adapter.format(value, {year: 'numeric'}) -> (Japanese era year, locale-dependent)\r\n  ```\r\n  → calculations use ISO, output uses the Japanese calendar.\r\n- `mode`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'datetime'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:30');\r\n  // Output examples:\r\n  // mode: 'date'    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15\r\n  // mode: 'datetime'->

```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:30[UTC]');\r\n  // Output example: adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  ```\r\n  → zoned values in UTC.\r\n- `disambiguation`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'America/New_York', disambiguation: 'later'});\r\n  const value = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2024-11-03T01:05').toZonedDateTime('America/New_York', {\r\n    disambiguation: 'later',\r\n  });\r\n  // Output examples (same local time):\r\n  // compatible -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-11-03T01:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]\r\n  // earlier    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-11-03T01:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]\r\n

Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2019-12-23T12:00:00-02:00[America/Sao_Paulo]', {\r\n    offset: 'ignore',\r\n  });\r\n  // Output examples (same input string):\r\n  // use    -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T11:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // ignore -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T12:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // prefer -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2019-12-23T12:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]\r\n  // reject -> adapter.deserialize(...) -> invalid\r\n  ```\r\n  → keep local time when offset conflicts with zone on parse.\r\n- `rounding`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', rounding: {smallestUnit: 'minute', roundingIncrement: 5}});\r\n  const value = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-01-15T12:34:56[UTC]');\r\n  // Output examples (roundingMode):\r\n  // halfExpand -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:35:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // floor      -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // ceil       -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:35:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  // trunc      -> adapter.toIso8601(value) -> 2024-01-15T12:30:00+00:00[UTC]\r\n  ```\r\n  → outputs rounded to 5-minute steps.\r\n- `firstDayOfWeek`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({firstDayOfWeek: 1});\r\n  // Output example: adapter.getFirstDayOfWeek() -> 1\r\n  ```\r\n  → weeks start on Monday.\r\n- `overflow`\r\n  ```ts\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({overflow: 'reject'});\r\n  // Output example (reject): adapter.createDate(2024, 1, 31) -> throws\r\n  provideTemporalDateAdapter({overflow: 'constrain'});\r\n  // Output example (constrain): adapter.createDate(2024, 1, 31) -> 2024-02-29\r\n  ```\r\n  → invalid dates throw; invalid dates clamp.\r\n\r\n**Form control example (overflow)**\r\n```ts\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date', overflow: 'constrain'});\r\nconst control = new FormControl(Temporal.PlainDate.from({year: 2024, month: 2, day: 31}));\r\n```\r\nEffect: the value is clamped to the last valid day of the month (e.g. 2024-02-29) instead of throwing.\r\n\r\n### Split adapter option examples\r\n```ts\r\nprovidePlainTemporalAdapter({mode: 'date', calendar: 'iso8601', outputCalendar: 'japanese'});\r\nprovideZonedDateTimeAdapter({timezone: 'UTC', disambiguation: 'reject', rounding: {smallestUnit: 'minute'}});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n```ts\r\nimport {provideTemporalDateAdapter} from '@angular/material-temporal-adapter';\r\n\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'date'});\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'datetime'});\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned'}); // default: system timezone\r\nprovideTemporalDateAdapter({mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport {\r\n  providePlainTemporalAdapter,\r\n  provideZonedDateTimeAdapter,\r\n} from '@angular/material-temporal-adapter/adapter/split';\r\n\r\nprovidePlainTemporalAdapter({mode: 'date'});\r\nprovidePlainTemporalAdapter({mode: 'datetime'});\r\nprovideZonedDateTimeAdapter({timezone: 'Europe/Warsaw'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration patterns\r\n- **From `NativeDateAdapter` (`Date`)**: switch to `mode: 'date'`, replace `Date` with `Temporal.PlainDate`. If you rely on timezone/time-of-day behavior, use `mode: 'zoned'` with the system timezone instead.\r\n- **From `MomentDateAdapter`/`LuxonDateAdapter` (date+time)**: use `mode: 'datetime'`, replace values with `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.\r\n- **From timezone-aware usage**: use `mode: 'zoned'` + `timezone`, replace values with `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`.\r\n- **From Luxon `defaultOutputCalendar`**: keep `calendar` for calculations, set `outputCalendar` for display.\r\n- **From apps relying on DST/offset rules or rounding**: configure `disambiguation`, `offset`, and `rounding` in `zoned` mode.\r\n- **Incremental/explicit type choice**: use split adapters (`PlainTemporalAdapter` or `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`).\r\n- If a Temporal polyfill is needed, load it before bootstrapping the app.\r\n- If you provide custom `MAT_DATE_FORMATS`, ensure they are `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (Temporal ignores parse formats and parses ISO strings only).\r\n\r\n**Custom display formats**\r\n```ts\r\nimport {MatDateFormats} from '@angular/material/core';\r\nimport {provideTemporalDateAdapter, MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS} from '@angular/material-temporal-adapter';\r\n\r\nconst MY_TEMPORAL_FORMATS = {\r\n  ...MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS,\r\n  display: {\r\n    ...MAT_TEMPORAL_DATE_FORMATS.display,\r\n    dateInput: {year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric'},\r\n  },\r\n} satisfies MatDateFormats;\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [provideTemporalDateAdapter(MY_TEMPORAL_FORMATS, {mode: 'date'})],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**MAT token notes**\r\n- `MAT_DATE_LOCALE`: locale string used for formatting and week info.\r\n- `MAT_DATE_FORMATS`: must be `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (parse formats ignored).\r\n\r\n## Comparison and mapping\r\n- Follows the same `DateAdapter` contract as `NativeDateAdapter`, `MomentDateAdapter`, `LuxonDateAdapter`, and `DateFnsAdapter`.\r\n- Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` for display formatting (like `NativeDateAdapter`), but the backing values are Temporal types instead of `Date`.\r\n\r\n**Option mapping (approximate)**\r\n| Existing adapter | Option | Temporal equivalent | Notes |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| NativeDateAdapter | n/a | `mode: 'date'` | Temporal `PlainDate` is the closest analogue to `Date` for date-only use. |\r\n| MomentDateAdapter | `useUtc: true` | `mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'` | Use zoned+UTC for UTC-centric workflows. |\r\n| MomentDateAdapter | `strict: true` | `overflow: 'reject'` | Temporal parsing is ISO-only; `overflow` controls invalid date creation. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `useUtc: true` | `mode: 'zoned', timezone: 'UTC'` | Similar UTC behavior. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `firstDayOfWeek` | `firstDayOfWeek` | Same semantics. |\r\n| LuxonDateAdapter | `defaultOutputCalendar` | `outputCalendar` | Calendar used for output/formatting (calculations use `calendar`). |\r\n| DateFnsAdapter | n/a | `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` + `MAT_DATE_FORMATS` | Temporal adapter also uses locale + formats. |\r\n\r\n## Notable design choices / dilemmas (with resolution)\r\n### 1) Temporal typings source (TypeScript not shipping them yet)\r\nTypeScript does not currently ship `lib.esnext.temporal` in the version used here, so this PR includes local declarations to type the adapter until the repo upgrades to a TS version that includes Temporal libs.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/62628\r\n\r\n### 2) API Extractor goldens\r\nAPI Extractor had trouble resolving the global `Temporal` namespace in this setup. Additionally, existing adapter packages (moment/luxon/date-fns) don’t have API goldens. For consistency and to avoid introducing a blocked/flaky step, this PR does not add API golden coverage for this adapter package.\r\n\r\n### 3) Formatting implementation note\r\n`Intl.DateTimeFormat` is used for localization (same overall approach as other adapters). Zoned values are formatted using the configured timezone.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- Unit tests cover all `mode` variants and timezone behavior, plus creation/parsing/formatting/time operations.\r\n- Latest run: `pnpm test src/material-temporal-adapter --no-watch` on Chromium (local).\r\n  - Result: 141 passed, 2 skipped (Islamic calendar suite skipped because `islamic` calendar is not supported by the current Temporal implementation).\r\n- Note: split adapters (`PlainTemporalAdapter`, `ZonedDateTimeAdapter`) are not explicitly covered by a dedicated spec yet.\r\n\r\n## Open questions (feedback requested)\r\n1) Calendar type: keep `calendar` as `string` (max flexibility) vs trying to constrain it (risk of being incomplete/locale-dependent).\r\n2) Positioning: should this adapter be documented as “ready” like other adapters, or called out as “early” given current ecosystem support for Temporal?\r\n3) Should `mode` be required for the unified adapter (no implicit default), or keep the default `date` mode?\r\n4) Should `overflow` default to `reject` (strict) or align with Temporal’s `constrain` default?\r\n5) Should we add migration examples to the public docs (datepicker/timepicker) instead of only in the PR description?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32668","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-temporal-adapter): add Temporal API date adapter\" (#32668)"},{"Id":"3826195706","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-18T02:13:50","Actor":"Gouvernathor","Number":"32667","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(table): the \"sticky\" input doesn't exist","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n[This doc page](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/overview#sticky-rows-and-columns) says that\n> In order to fix the header row to the top of the scrolling viewport containing the table, you can add a sticky input to the matHeaderRowDef.\n\nAdding the `sticky` attribute to the element carrying the matHeaderRowDef structural directive has no effect.

After the migrations, we've noticed odd behaviour concerning the flyout of the Material Autocomplete. On the first input/results, the flyout shifts to the top of the page.

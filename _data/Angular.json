Developers must then explicitly trigger change detection which can be tricky (e.g. some guard might add some delay etc...). This makes tests more fragile and complex and kind of defeats the purpose of `RouterTestingHarness`.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, while `RouterTestingHarness` triggers change detection when explicitly calling `navigateByUrl()` or implicitly by passing an initial URL to `create()`...\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/dedac8d3f73ebf4f05b773454e2a22ab5fa4bf7c/packages/router/testing/src/router_testing_harness.ts#L135-L138\r\n\r\n... it doesn't trigger it when navigation is triggered otherwise.\r\n\r\nThanks to @tomalaforge for raising questions on testing + routing in Cypress.\r\nThanks to @atscott  for the quick feedback and help to pinpoint this.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n`RouterTestingHarness` should trigger change detection after each navigation.\r\nThis can be done by subscribing to `Router.events` and triggering change detection on each `NavigationEnd`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})\r\nexport class RootFixtureService {\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  private subscription?: Subscription;\r\n\r\n  createHarness(): RouterTestingHarness {\r\n    if (this.harness) {\r\n      throw new Error('Only one harness should be created per test.');\r\n    }\r\n    this.harness = new RouterTestingHarness(this.getRootFixture());\r\n\r\n    this.subscription = TestBed.inject(Router).events\r\n      .pipe(filter(e => e instanceof NavigationEnd))\r\n      .subscribe(() => this.harness.detectChanges()); \r\n\r\n    return this.harness;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.subscription?.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a PR.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMeanwhile, here is a temporary workaround one can use.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync function createHarness(initialUrl: string) {\r\n  const harness = await RouterTestingHarness.create(initialUrl);\r\n  autoDetectChanges(harness);\r\n  return harness;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction autoDetectChanges(harness: RouterTestingHarness) {\r\n  TestBed.inject(Router)\r\n    .events.pipe(filter((e) => e instanceof NavigationEnd))\r\n    .subscribe(() => harness.detectChanges());\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RouterTestingHarness should trigger change detection after any navigation\" (#49398)"},{"Id":"1619733082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T23:05:57","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"49397","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update io_bazel_rules_sass digest to aa03944","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| io_bazel_rules_sass | http_archive | digest | `1f27790` -> `aa03944` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/core\r\n@angular/platform-browser\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the source as well as the [Docs](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/DomSanitizer), the DomSanitizer class contains:\r\n- bypassSecurityTrust* methods used to bypass sanitization checks which return a SafeValue subtype.\r\n- a single 'sanitize' method which can receive a SafeValue and will unwrap it into a simple string. (I believe also this method was originally intended to only be used by the framework internally and was made public later)\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach, is that consumers have no clear way of opting into the sanitization, and receiving a safe type back.\r\nThe only way to achieve this is to call both methods. The documentation does not exemplify concretely how and *if* these methods should be used together. Feel free to correct me if this approach is not the one considered best practice.\r\n```\r\nconst sanitizedUrl: string = this.domSanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.URL, url)\r\nconst safeUrl: SafeUrl = this.domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(sanitizedUrl)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn practice this proves to be quite unintuitive, as the sanitize method can receives as a parameter a SafeValue, which can only be obtained by calling a bypassSecurityTrust* method, leading users to believe perhaps they need to call a bypass method first, or that they shouldn't call the sanitize method at all.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nCreate a new method, that performs the same sanitization logic as in the currently existing 'sanitize' method, whilst returning the corresponding SafeValue subtype and instruct users to use this one by default, and to only use the bypassSecurityTrust* method when providing their own sanitization or method to verify the source of the value.\r\n\r\nSee PR for this here: **PR LINK TO BE ADDED LATER**\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to update the documentation with a better sample showing how to use the 'sanitize' and 'bypassSecurityTrust*' methods together, and recommend this approach as the go-to when facing typing issues due to sanitization.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49386","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve DomSanitizer API with a method that returns a SafeValue. \" (#49386)"},{"Id":"1618648756","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T09:34:44","Actor":"HappyMajor","Number":"49384","RawContent":null,"Title":"Keyframe scoping fails when declaring multiple values for the animation property.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am using the default value of View.encapsulation and get the following problem:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-03 103440](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1957550/224280638-7861136a-71bb-4bde-9386-45f91c84e8c0.png)\r\n\r\nThis will only scope the first animation theoFlyInX.\r\n\r\nChrome dev console:\r\n![scope-failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1957550/224280651-1b65d406-f0bd-4f35-814c-a52d87371f23.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I declare multiple animations like this then it will work:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-03 103954](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1957550/224278119-fb693aae-1bf0-4c7e-80da-00a7da1d25cd.png)\r\n\r\nChrome dev console:\r\n![scoped-right](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1957550/224278188-24aa7a11-29a0-4727-ac0b-f5c8e8b63755.png)\r\n\r\nI think the problem lies in the following file: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a50ff60bff64859e4cd279a9ce0c8b47e6dfa691/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L303\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49384","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Keyframe scoping fails when declaring multiple values for the animation property.\" (#49384)"},{"Id":"1618342598","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T04:29:31","Actor":"Brian-urogallo","Number":"49383","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR Error: NG0900: Error trying to diff '[object Object]'.

This would be a useful feature for shareable/generic form components - they could take a `FormGroup` of a certain type, where some (or all) fields might be optional, but where the passing component can specify some of them.\r\n\r\nSome examples are in this stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-jgpu5s?file=src/main.ts\r\n\r\nThe error (specifically in the second example) suggests the type is forcing the assignability check in both directions regardless of which side is actually being assigned, while the two types are at least somewhat compatible (can be compared).\r\n\r\nThe only alternative at the moment is to use the least restrictive type for everything, which can add unneeded fields to the usages, and/or add unneeded and cumbersome optionality/nullability.\r\n\r\nWasn't sure whether to put this as a feature request or bug, since there might actually be a functional difference/design decision that I'm not understanding. Possibly (?) related to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47091 but that seemed a bit more specific and had some inheritence/extension complexity.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nformGroup: FormGroup<{ foo: FormControl<string>; bar: FormControl<string> };\r\nformGroupSubset: FormGroup<{ foo: FormControl<string> }>;\r\n\r\nformGroupSubset = formGroup;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor at least this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nformGroup: FormGroup<{ foo: FormControl<string>; bar: FormControl<string> };\r\noptionalFormGroup: FormGroup<{ foo?: FormControl<string>, bar?: FormControl<string> }>;\r\n\r\noptionalFormGroup = formGroup;\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support full structural subtyping/\"duck typing\" for typed forms\" (#49374)"},{"Id":"1615914933","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-08T20:50:28","Actor":"atscott","Number":"49373","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Decouple `NgZone` from `ApplicationRef`","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits\r\n\r\nAlso reviewer note for size tracking: This does increase the bundle size due to the additional tokens.

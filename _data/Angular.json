While Vitest does not have a direct equivalent for multiset equality, the schematic previously transformed this into a check for length and subset containment, which could lead to false positives (e.g., `[1, 1]` matches `[1, 2]`).

However, when deploying the application, the UI appears broken (styles are not applied correctly or components are not rendering), even though the browser network tab shows all JS and CSS files loading with 200 OK and the browser console is completely empty (no errors).\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a new Ionic/Angular project (or use an existing one with the versions below).\n2. Run ionic build --configuration production (which uses @angular-devkit/build-angular with optimization: true).\n3. Deploy to a static host or serve the www folder.\n4. Open the app in the browser.\n\nCurrent Behavior: The app loads, but styles/scripts seem corrupted or ignored. The UI is broken (missing styles, interactive elements not working). No errors in the console.\n\nExpected Behavior: The app should look and behave exactly like in the development environment (ionic serve).\n\nWorkaround: The only way to fix this was to disable optimization in angular.json for the production configuration:\n\n\"optimization\": false\n\nOR specifically disabling the build optimizer (if applicable to the schema).\n\nConclusion: It seems like the build optimizer / minifier in Angular CLI 20 is generating silent corruptions when paired with this specific stack, which prevents the browser from applying the code correctly despite successful download.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nEnvironment:\n- OS: Windows (o tu SO actual)\n- Node: v20.19.5\n- NPM: 10.8.2\n- Angular CLI: 20.3.4\n- @ionic/angular: ^8.0.0\n- @angular-devkit/build-angular: ^20.0.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31857","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Bug] Production build with optimization enabled breaks UI styles/scripts (Angular 20 + Ionic 8)\" (#31857)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3644421095","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-19T21:05:19","Actor":"shanti-razr","Number":"32385","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): Talkback cannot navigate long dropdowns","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen navigating through a mat-select element using Talkback on an Android mobile device, dropdowns with many options cause the page to not maintain focus and result in major jittering and page UI issues.

The element that is being focused should be indicated to the user.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSwipping left and right with standard mobile screen reader navigation on long dropdowns results in UI reloading errors and focus issues.

Even though the scrollable container uses the `cdkScrollable` directive.\n\nIn my use case, the left navigation panel contains a list of drop lists, and the source page also has its own elements.

The popover will be inserted after this element in the DOM.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary for cases where we need to move the popover element needs to be in an element that is not the origin: \r\nE.g.:  Here the ngMenu needs to have the popover as a child, but we still want the great positioning and styles by having the origin on the fileItem menu item. \r\n```\r\n<div ngMenuBar>\r\n  <div ngMenuItem #fileItem value=\"File\" [submenu]=\"fileMenu\">File</div>\r\n    <div ngMenu #fileMenuElement #fileMenu=\"ngMenu\">\r\n        <ng-template \r\n            [cdkConnectedOverlay]=\"{origin: fileItem, usePopover: 'inline'}\"\r\n            [cdkCustomPopoverInsertionElement]=\"fileMenuElement\"\r\n            cdkAttachPopoverAsChild\r\n            [cdkConnectedOverlayOpen]=\"fileMenu.visible()\">\r\n              <div ngMenuItem value=\"New\">New</div>\r\n              <div ngMenuItem value=\"Open\">Open</div>\r\n              <div ngMenuItem value=\"Exit\">Exit</div>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  <div ngMenuItem #editItem value=\"Edit\" [submenu]=\"editMenu\">Edit</div>\r\n    <div ngMenu #editMenuElement #editMenu=\"ngMenu\">\r\n        <ng-template\r\n          [cdkConnectedOverlay]=\"{origin: editItem, usePopover: 'inline'}\"\r\n          [cdkCustomPopoverInsertionElement]=\"editMenuElement\"\r\n          cdkAttachPopoverAsChild\r\n          [cdkConnectedOverlayOpen]=\"editMenu.visible()\">\r\n            <div ngMenuItem value=\"Cut\">Cut</div>\r\n            <div ngMenuItem value=\"Copy\">Copy</div>\r\n            <div ngMenuItem value=\"Paste\">Paste</div>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n - `cdkAttachPopoverAsChild`: A boolean that, when true, attaches the popover as a child of the popove\r\n     host, rather than as a sibling.   \r\n\r\nThis allows us to avoid adding a child element on `ngMenu`\r\nBEFORE: \r\n```\r\n<button #trigger ngMenuTrigger [menu]=\"optionMenu\">...</button>\r\n\r\n<div ngMenu #optionMenu=\"ngMenu\">\r\n  <div #origin>\r\n    <ng-template\r\n      [cdkConnectedOverlay]=\"{origin, usePopover: 'inline'}\"\r\n      [cdkConnectedOverlayOpen]=\"optionMenu.visible()\">\r\n      <ng-template ngMenuContent>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"1\">...</div>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"2\">...</div>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"3\">...</div>\r\n      </ng-template>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFTER: \r\n``` \r\n<button #trigger ngMenuTrigger [menu]=\"optionMenu\">...</button>\r\n\r\n<div ngMenu #origin #optionMenu=\"ngMenu\">\r\n    <ng-template\r\n      [cdkConnectedOverlay]=\"{origin, usePopover: 'inline'}\"\r\n      [cdkConnectedOverlayOpen]=\"optionMenu.visible()\"\r\n      cdkAttachPopoverAsChild>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"Option 1\">Option 1</div>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"Option 2\">Option 2</div>\r\n        <div ngMenuItem value=\"Option 3\">Option 3</div>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32362","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(cdk/overlay): enhance popover insertion control with new inputs\" (#32362)"},{"Id":"3635015482","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T20:47:14","Actor":"teja2","Number":"32366","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: clarify comparison range colors in date range picker example #31663","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32366","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: clarify comparison range colors in date range picker example #31663\" (#32366)"},{"Id":"3634775069","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T19:39:48","Actor":"ZRunner","Number":"32365","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(focus): Persistent focus/ripple indicator stays visible on click","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv14.2.7\n\n### Description\n\nThere is a long-standing issue in Angular Material where, after clicking on interactive components (buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, slide-toggle), the focus or “ripple” visual indicator remains visible until the user clicks somewhere else (i.e., until the component loses focus).\n\n### Key points:\n\n1. **History of this issue**\n  -

In #31569 (July 2025), it's a bit different as it concerns menu items but still has the same issue: \"right click first item gets focus (which he should), but he also receive focus:visible ring design\". Another user points out that it may be related to \"the sequence of events the CDK sends to it\", but the issue died without any proper investigation.\n\n2. **Fixes attempted**\n  - The FocusMonitor bug #25188 (Jun 2022) where `cdk-program-focused` is incorrectly applied on mouse click was marked as completed\n  - The associated PR #25232 improved focus detection, especially when a label is clicked, but it doesn’t entirely solve the visual persistence issue for all components.\n\n3. **Version testing on the Angular Material doc site**\nAfter checking each latest minor version on the material.angular.dev website: \n- For checkboxes, the issue does not appear in earlier **latest** minor versions (before v15), but is present again from v15 onward (tested in v16, v17… up to v21 RC). A few issues also indicate this bug actually existed in version like v14 but got fixed before the latest minor, hence why I couldn't check it today.\n- For radio buttons, the bug is visible from v11 to v13, was fixed in v14 (see #23807), but was reintroduced somewhen during v15 until today\n\n4. **Accessibility & UX concerns**\n  - The persistent indicator can be confusing: after clicking, the element looks like it’s still “active” or focused, which might not reflect its real state\n  - Most other libraries I've checked fade out ripples after *mouse* click, so this behavior is surprising for people used to other websites\n- According to the CSS `:focus-visible` mechanism, focus indication should ideally reflect input modality (e.g. keyboard vs mouse). The MDN spec explains that `:focus-visible` is designed to show focus rings only when useful (e.g. keyboard navigation), precisely to differentiate when focus indicators should be shown depending on input modality (y'know, on the contrary to `:focus`...).\n- Persistent focus indicators can degrade usability or cause visual noise, especially in complex UI flows (I actually got several bug reports from customers confused by it)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-dqjhk5mq?file=src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Angular Material (e.g. version 15+)\n2. Render a component like `<mat-radio-button>` or `<mat-checkbox>`\n3. Click the element with the mouse\n4. Observe that the ripple or focus ring stays visible after the click completes\n5. Click somewhere else (outside the element) to unfocus and notice how the focus indicator disappears\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- After a mouse click, the ripple/focus indicator should fade out (or be removed) even if the component remains focused.\n- The behavior should be consistent across input types: mouse clicks vs keyboard interactions\n- Persistent focus indicators should align with modern focus pseudo-attributes (`:focus` vs `:focus-visible`), showing visible indicators only when needed and not “sticking” unnecessarily after click interactions\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Ripple or focus ring remains on the component after click and only goes away when the component loses focus (when clicking away)\n- This behavior is visible on both checkboxes, radio buttons and actual buttons\n- The bug has appeared, disappeared, and reappeared across versions, suggesting regression or incomplete fix\n\n### Environment\n\nDoesn't really matter that much but here's the linked Stackblitz env.\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- Browser(s): Firefox 145.0\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11, macOS 26\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(focus): Persistent focus/ripple indicator stays visible on click\" (#32365)"},{"Id":"3634376919","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T17:59:48","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"32364","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/combobox): escape key behavior","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32364","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(aria/combobox): escape key behavior\" (#32364)"},{"Id":"3633112280","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T12:23:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32363","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/select): render panel next to trigger","State":"open","Body":"Renders the select panel next to the trigger in order to keep it within the tab order and resolve some long-standing accessibility issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32363","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/select): render panel next to trigger\" (#32363)"},{"Id":"3631760260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T05:06:14","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32361","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency bazel to v7.7.1 (21.0.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| [bazel](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) | patch | `7.7.0` -> `7.7.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel (bazel)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.7.1`](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Release-771-2025-11-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/7.7.0...7.7.1)\n\n```\n\nRelease Notes:\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

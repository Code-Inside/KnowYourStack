This removes the need for the big_integer helper code and associated tests as the code was not used anywhere else in the framework. Only the `BigInt` constructor, `BigInt.asUintN` function, and `.toString` function are currently used. `BigInt` literals can unfortunately not yet be used due to the bazel test devmode setup which compiles the TypeScript code at an EcmaScript level that does not yet support the literals.\r\n\r\nThis change plus the recent DataView refactoring results in a ~15% performance improvement for digest calculation.\r\n\r\nBrowser support information (`@angular/compiler` should only be present in an application if using JIT mode):\r\n- BigInt constructor: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_bigint_bigint\r\n- BigInt asUintN: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_bigint_asuintn\r\n- BigInt toString: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_bigint_tostring\r\n\r\nNode.js 10.4.0 and higher also provide support (Angular officially supports `^14.20.0 || ^16.13.0 || ^18.10.0`).\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48321","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler): use native BigInt when calculating i18n digests\" (#48321)"},{"Id":"1472043235","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-01T22:29:07","Actor":"piecioshka","Number":"48318","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix the name of stub component","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Secondly, the hash strategy is a location configuration in `@angular/common` and you can use it outside of the Router or with any custom router implementations. So while the net effect of using the router is that it updates the URL which is controlled by the strategy, this feature provider doesn't necessarily need to exist in the Router. The location strategy is an application-wide configuration and affects anything that imports `Location`.  Of course, the Router does this in a few places but plenty of other things might as well.\r\n\r\nThe argument for this feature:\r\n\r\n* Discoverability. While `LocationStrategy` is technically in `@angular/common`, the most common use-case _is_ when using it with the Router.\r\n* Precedence in the `RouterModule.forRoot([], {useHash: true})`\r\n* Precedence in other routing libraries (`createWebHashHistory` in VueJS and `HashRouter` in React, for example)\r\n* The implementation of `withHashLocation` is much more clear than `useHash` was.

For example you install `react` and `react-dom` into the workspace, you add `\"jsx\": \"react-jsx\"` to your tsconfig, you wrap your react component in a web component, you import your web component into your project app, you add CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA to the app.module.ts, and you use the webcomponent markup inside of the template of the component of your choosing. (I also added the line `\"include\": [\"./src/**/*.ts\", \"./src/**/*.js\", \"./src/**/*.tsx\", \"./src/**/*.jsx\"],` to the tsconfig.)\r\n\r\nI am now trying to set up building the library.

The bug (already solved in\r\nv16 of Safari)- is very subtle, hard to re-reproduce but basically\r\nvariable scope tracking is broken. This bug is triggered by additional\r\nparenthesis in the initializer expression. See:\r\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236843.\r\n\r\nThe TypeScript compiler may generate such additional parenthesis when\r\nit tries to adjust the `this` context when invoking methods, such as for\r\ndefining animations in the `ecmp` definition.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24355#issuecomment-1333477033\r\n\r\nTo ensure Angular applications are not subject to this bug when\r\ntargeting Safari <=v15. v15 Safari, both for iOS and Mac is still part of\r\nthe default CLI browserslist with `last 2 Safari majors` (at time of\r\nwriting).\r\n\r\nNote that it is important that the Babel plugin properly handles the\r\ndownleveling of static block-defined members. TypeScript will transform\r\nstatic fields, like `static ecmp` into `static { this.ecmp = X }` when\r\n`useDefineForClassFields = false` (which is the case for CLI apps). The\r\nclass properties plugin from Babel seems to handle this in an acceptable\r\nway. Unlike actual static fields, Babel will not use helpers like\r\n`defineProperty` for such extracted static blocks though. e.g.\r\n\r\nSee repro: https://gist.github.com/devversion/dec0dea26e348c509921bf62079b60be\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Test {\r\n  x = true;\r\n\r\n  static b = true;\r\n  static {\r\n    this.a = true;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// into\r\n\r\nclass X {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    _defineProperty(this, \"x\", true);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n_defineProperty(X, \"b\", true);\r\nX.a = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nnote that in practice TypeScript with `useDefineForClassFields = false`\r\nwill put non-static members into the constructor as normal assignments\r\nregardless- so there would be no change by the Babel plugin.\r\n\r\nFixes #24355 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24357","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downlevel class properties when targeting Safari <=v15\" (#24357)"},{"Id":"1471443706","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-02T09:04:51","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"24358","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): add missing import for functional interceptor spec","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Java paths in particular run into this in google3, where users might want to generate `foo/bar/baz.ts`, `java/com/corp/foo/bar/baz.java`, and `javatests/com/corp/foo/bar/baz.java`.\r\n\r\nSchematics currently restricts users to the current directory, so this use case doesn't work intuitively.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'm not sure about the proper solution to this problem. I do agree with the current behavior that schematics _should_ be scoped to a particular directory and prevent accesses outside of that, both for security and usability reasons. That said, I think this monorepo issue is a very real problem, so it would be nice to have some kind of support for it.\r\n\r\nSome strawman ideas for a solution:\r\n* Let schematics \"`cd`\" into a different directory and use that as the root. So even if it's run in `foo/bar/`, it could use `../../` as its root and access the whole monorepo.\r\n* Let schematics declare the root directory in their schema relative to the project root: `{ \"root\": \"../../\" }`.\r\n* Prompt users to give access to directories outside the default one in a permissions model. This is probably the safest but also the most annoying to use.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nBest alternative is to run the schematic in the monorepo root, but this can be awkward for users who `cd` in to their particular project directory.\r\n\r\nI think you can also edit external files via a `Task`, but then you're throwing away a lot of the ergonomics of schematics, so that's not a great escape hatch.

By setting the terser `ecma` option to `es2015`, terser will not turn existing syntax into newer syntax features that might be unsupported. Terser will also not downlevel any code based on this option.\r\n\r\nFixes #24347","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24353","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): prevent optimization adding unsupported ECMASCript features\" (#24353)"},{"Id":"1470786764","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-01T00:46:26","Actor":"mattbodman","Number":"24354","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live reload does not reflect all code changes","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSeveral of us working on the same project are encountering an issue where `ng serve` will reload on code changes as expected but not always reflect _all_ code changes.  The app will typically crash on a \"missing\" code block because it cannot find said block.  However, the block DOES exist, but may have just been added amongst other changes.  The workaround is to modify the block again (by adding a comment or console.log), forcing a fresh reload.  Invariably, this will rectify the issue.\r\nWe upgraded from v11 to v14 a few months ago and it is believed the issue has been introduced since then.  At that time, however, we started restructuring the app by using modules and lazy loading, in case that's relevant somehow.\r\nI have been using Angular for many years and have not encountered this issue before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nThe error in the screenshot below was produced by adding a new method to this demo repo [https://github.com/mattbodman/reload-issue](https://github.com/mattbodman/reload-issue)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1167\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1994501/205180260-9144948a-bb5d-4954-a161-5bdd576ded75.png\">\r\n\r\nWhilst the screenshot shows the project successfully compiling after the error, our project frequently does not.

As a result, I'm attempting to create all of my projects in Angular solely. But I can't figure out how to resize ui components in angular material to versions like small medium large xlarge. Official documentation explicitly states not to change any internal styles because it may break my code in future versions. I'm currently using CSS's zoom property to create several variants (small, medium, large) of the components. This works for the majority of the components, but not all. . What else can I do at this point?

Unsure.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe issue title pretty much covers it but here is another example:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<super-duper-long-component-name [prop]=\"someVar\" />\r\n<!-- instead of -->\r\n<super-duper-long-component-name [prop]=\"someVar\"></super-duper-long-component-name>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an existing issue for this, #673, but it was closed due to inactivity.\r\n\r\nThat issue got half-rejected (it was not resolved) on the basis of the HTML spec, which does not allow self-closing tags. That makes a total of **zero** sense to me. The HTML template language is already far beyond what vanilla HTML offers, and that is the entire point of using a framework like Angular. Many other major frameworks (React/Vue/Svelte to name a few) already support self-closing component tags.\r\n\r\nI understand that Angular templates were being parsed in the browser before, but why should ease-of-life syntax sugar be banned when using AOT compilation? Sure, some people still use JIT-compiled Angular, but then again, some people still use Internet Explorer in 2020. If they want to suffer so be it but why refuse to add excellent features for the rest of us? There are plenty of antifeatures out there but I personally think self-closing tags are pretty intuitive and improve the code quality significantly; from the looks of #673 it seems like a lot of other people agree.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider self-closing component tags.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nContinue to sigh as I write needlessly verbose code and write checks for two different nullish types.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39525","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Self-closing component tags (<my-comp/> instead of <my-comp></my-comp>)?\" (#39525)"},{"Id":"733828302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T23:38:48","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"39524","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic component detectChanges trigger ngDoCheck but not refresh view","State":"open","Body":"This is a related issue of #36667. \r\nReproduce live demo is here.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vz1dca?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts\r\n\r\ncode is this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {\r\n  Component,\r\n  NgModule,\r\n  ViewContainerRef,\r\n  ComponentFactoryResolver,\r\n  Injector,\r\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy,\r\n  DoCheck\r\n} from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\r\n\r\nimport { timer } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"dynamic\",\r\n  template: `\r\n    {{ name }}\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class Dynamic implements DoCheck {\r\n  name = \"initial name\";\r\n\r\n  ngDoCheck() {\r\n    console.log(\"docheck dynamic\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"my-app\",\r\n  template: `\r\n    <b>Expected</b>: \"initial name\" changes to \"changed name\" after 2s<br />\r\n    <b>Actual</b>:<br />\r\n  `,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _vcRef: ViewContainerRef,\r\n    private _cfr: ComponentFactoryResolver,\r\n    private _injector: Injector\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    const cmptRef = this._cfr\r\n      .resolveComponentFactory(Dynamic)\r\n      .create(this._injector);\r\n    this._vcRef.insert(cmptRef.hostView);\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      cmptRef.instance.name = \"changed name\";\r\n      console.log(\"changing name\");\r\n      cmptRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent, Dynamic],\r\n  entryComponents: [Dynamic],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is for `dynamic component`, there is a host view as a placeholder, the `hooks` are registered on the host view not the component view, when calling `componentRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`, it will run change detection from root host view, and trigger the `doCheck hook`, but when it really want to refresh child component, since it is a onPush component and not marked dirty, it will not be refreshed. \r\n\r\nI will try to resolve this issue in #39463 too.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dynamic component detectChanges trigger ngDoCheck but not refresh view\" (#39524)"},{"Id":"733754655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T16:16:38","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"39523","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): recover unterminated property and event bindings","State":"open","Body":"This commit enables the formation of partially-complete r3 asts even\r\nwhen semantically invalid property/event/two-way bindings of the\r\n()/[]/[()] syntax are discovered.\r\n\r\nPart of #38596","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39523","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler): recover unterminated property and event bindings\" (#39523)"},{"Id":"733730710","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-31T14:19:14","Actor":"alvipeo","Number":"39522","RawContent":null,"Title":"Does angular take any advantage from multicore CPU's?","State":"open","Body":"I tried to ask this question on SO but admins did not approve as the question is not focused enough 🤨 Really???\r\n\r\nMy question - Does angular takes any advantage from multicore CPU's? what is the architecture of compiler/CLI?

This is the first time for me trying to implement a JSONP call to the Google Maps API in Angular and support Internet Explorer 11.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA JSONP call to the Google Maps API fails in Internet Explorer 11 while it works fine in other browsers.\r\n\r\nI followed this guide: https://github.com/angular/components/tree/master/src/google-maps#lazy-loading-the-api\r\n\r\nJSONP calls only fail in Internet Explorer with the Google Maps API. I tried other JSONP endpoints, and they seem to work fine.\r\nSo, if you think this is not an Angular issue, this bug needs to taken to the Google Maps API I guess.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created a demo repository here: https://github.com/sebastianhaeni/angular-jsonp-bug\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it cannot be reproduced on stackblitz because it needs a full prod build, so IE 11 can execute the JavaScript (ES5 and polyfills needed).\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that it's somehow a problem with the lifecycle of the JSONP callback function on the `window` object, which is maybe removed too early.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nUnhandled Promise rejection: ng_jsonp_callback_0 is not a function ; Zone: <root> ; Task: Promise.then ; Value: InvalidValueError:

Note the second commit that changes 2 files to make this happen:\r\nhttps://github.com/SLKnutson/angular-bug\r\nRun `ng build --configuration=\"production\"` and then look at the dist/styles.css file.\r\nCharset needs to be the first line in the file, but it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\nFound in mac and linux, haven't tried Windows\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIf node-sass is used, this problem doesn't occur because node-sass doesn't change the '\\f103' into a unicode character, and so no `@charset \"UTF-8\";` is needed.\r\n\r\nWhen optimization=true in angular.json, the error is fixed.\r\n\r\nI've done a little bit of digging, the css looks good coming out of the actual sass compiler, but gets messed up somewhere after that.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19246","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@charset \"UTF-8\"; not lifted to the top of the css file when @import url() used\" (#19246)"},{"Id":"732030968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-29T08:10:03","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"19252","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser-webpack-plugin to version 5.0.3","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser-webpack-plugin](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin) | dependencies | major | [`4.2.3` -> `5.0.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser-webpack-plugin/4.2.3/5.0.3) |\n| [terser-webpack-plugin](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin) | devDependencies | major | [`4.2.3` -> `5.0.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser-webpack-plugin/4.2.3/5.0.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.3`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;503-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev502v503-2020-10-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v5.0.2...v5.0.3)\n\n### [`v5.0.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;502-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev500v502-2020-10-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2)\n\n### [`v5.0.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;501-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev500v501-2020-10-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1)\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;500-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev423v500-2020-10-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v4.2.3...v5.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   webpack@4 no longer supported\n-   removed the `cache` option\n-   removed the `cacheKeys` option\n-   removed the `sourceMap` option (respect the `devtool` option by default)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   reduce deps\n-   performance improvement\n\n##### [4.2.3](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v4.2.2...v4.2.3) (2020-10-07)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   better minimizing `mjs` assets ([#&#8203;329](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/issues/329)) ([041b392](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/commit/041b39208d364c8af9cd2b3f8e503b05a77ae067))\n-   minify `cjs` assets ([#&#8203;328](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/issues/328)) ([b9c694d](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/commit/b9c694d2c1193438d3ef72fed8d1789d9a48a367))\n\n##### [4.2.2](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v4.2.1...v4.2.2) (2020-09-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   related asset info ([a75dc8b](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/commit/a75dc8bed97daecc509387a23a72699620695ab2))\n\n##### [4.2.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) (2020-09-15)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   cache for extracted comments ([#&#8203;314](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/issues/314)) ([5340814](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/commit/5340814188d53031b0444b8f588995dcbede88fc))\n-   compatibility with webpack@5 ([f5bd8f8](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/commit/f5bd8f8b1c0fc807fd00c57207e449056aeea35d))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When the user goes back and changes a selection, which then reduces the number of subsequent steps from what it was before, I am experiencing an error. More specifically, this error occurs when the number of newly rendered steps is less than the `selectedIndex` of the previously rendered steps.\r\n\r\nWhen the new steps are rendered, they are all closed (none are set as the `selectedIndex`). When I click on one of the steps I get this error:\r\n```\r\nERROR TypeError: Cannot set property 'interacted' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you click on a step it is calling this function which changes the `selectedIndex` of the stepper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset selectedIndex(index) {\r\n        const newIndex = coerceNumberProperty(index);\r\n        if (this.steps && this._steps) {\r\n            // Ensure that the index can't be out of bounds.\r\n            if ((newIndex < 0 || newIndex > this.steps.length - 1) &&\r\n                (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode)) {\r\n                throw Error('cdkStepper: Cannot assign out-of-bounds value to `selectedIndex`.');\r\n            }\r\n            if (this._selectedIndex != newIndex && !this._anyControlsInvalidOrPending(newIndex) &&\r\n                (newIndex >= this._selectedIndex || this.steps.toArray()[newIndex].editable)) {\r\n                this._updateSelectedItemIndex(index);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            this._selectedIndex = newIndex;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case, we are hitting the line that calls this function:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n_anyControlsInvalidOrPending(index) {\r\n        const steps = this.steps.toArray();\r\n        steps[this._selectedIndex].interacted = true;\r\n        if (this._linear && index >= 0) {\r\n            return steps.slice(0, index).some(step => {\r\n                const control = step.stepControl;\r\n                const isIncomplete = control ?

So it is trying to set the `interacted` property of the previous step (the one you are leaving), but in this case that step no longer exists in the DOM due to the `ngIf` and, therefore, this line is causing an `undefined` error and crashing.\r\n\r\nSeems like there should be a way to account for this situation where the previously selected step no longer exists. Maybe just an `undefined` check that only updates the `interacted` property if the step still exists in the DOM?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20923","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error when removing steps from material stepper with ngIf when the selectedIndex is greater than the updated stepper length\" (#20923)"},{"Id":"732521855","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-29T18:39:34","Actor":"Totati","Number":"20922","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(selection-list): Add support to radio like mat-selection-lit","State":"closed","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently `<mat-selection-list multiple=\"false\"></mat-selection-list>` behaviour is far from ideal.

There are multiple themes included with material, none of which are listed in the documentation. There is no description of how to produce color maps for material, there's no description of how to marry together foreground and background maps. There's no clarity on how dividers etc. are themed and there's no real guidance on how to build custom themes. \r\n\r\nI would like to see:\r\n\r\n- a clear list of the maps that a theme requires to be complete\r\n- clear instructions on what maps should be used \r\n- a list of the maps that actually ship with the theme and guidance on how to use them\r\n- clearer SCSS functions to build the theme\r\n- clear guidance on how to build up custom typography suites\r\n- ideally a page that would allow you to put in colors and typography and would then generate the scss for it\r\n\r\nOR... at the very least it would be helpful for the documentation to at least state what it's not covering. There's so much stuff that you have to go rooting around in the source code to find (like what the existing color maps are and what the SCSS functions do). If the documentation at least listed out what the user needed to know that would be a helpful start. But the docs glance across all of the key subjects without going into adequate depth and the reader is left completely unclear as to whether she is being stupid or the docs are incomplete.

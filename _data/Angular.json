The problem was that closing an element would associate\r\nthe source span with the element at the top of the stack, however this may not\r\nbe the element that is actually being closed if some elements would be\r\nimplicitly closed.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by assigning the end source span with the element\r\non the stack that is actually being closed. Any implicitly closed elements that\r\nare popped off the stack will not be assigned an end source span, as the\r\nimplicit closing implies that no ending element is present.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a difference between self-closed elements such as `<input/>`\r\nand implicitly closed elements such as `<input>`. The former does have an end\r\nsource span (identical to its start source span) whereas the latter does not.\r\n\r\nFixes #36118\r\nResolves FW-2004","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38126","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): properly associate source spans for implicitly closed elements\" (#38126)"},{"Id":"659655364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-17T21:36:09","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"38125","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Update contributor info for kyliau","State":"open","Body":"Added twitter handle, website, and a short bio.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Building separately with Webpack in Production mode works as expected.\r\n\r\nI investigated the problem a bit and now I'd say that it's because of \"sideEffects: false\" in their package.json. If I understand correctly side effects and \"pure\" modules are different things, or? Anyway, build optimizer's webpack loader marks some code as PURE when it isn't.\r\n\r\nAt first I've [created issue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3708) in Swiper's repo but maintainer says that Webpack's tree shaking works as expected.

I'm guessing this has something to do with Ivy.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTS component:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.pug',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.sass']\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n\r\n  items = [\r\n    'one',\r\n    'two',\r\n    'three',\r\n    'four'\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPug template:\r\n```pug\r\nul\r\n  li(*ngFor=\"let item of items\") {{item}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the above example component and template in an Angular project. \r\n\r\nThe project builds without issue using `ng build` and `ng-build --prod`\r\n\r\nThe dev server starts without any issues using `ng serve` and the page renders as expected.\r\n\r\nOnce I start making changes to the project and the dev server automatically rebuilds, it prints the following error:\r\n`Property 'item' does not exist on type 'TestComponent'. Did you mean 'items'?`\r\n\r\nThe Angular application does appear to continue to work correctly and auto-rebuild on changes (printing that error every time), \r\nbut these false errors can potentially hide legitimate ones.\r\n\r\nThis happens with any variables generated with `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`.\r\n- `div(*ngIf=\"name$ | async as name\") {{name}}`: the `{{name}}` portion will generate an error\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs in both Angular 9 and 10.\r\n \r\nI have tried two different methods of adding pug support to my project, the error occurs with both:\r\n- Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack/v/9.2.0 to add a pug rule to webpack (using `apply-loader` and `pug-loader`)\r\n  - This method is demonstrated in the Minimal Reproduction section below\r\n- Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-cli-pug-loader/v/0.2.2\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is a repository resulting from the below steps: https://github.com/entith/ng-cli-pug-template-variable-issue\r\n\r\n1. run `ng new test --minimal --skip-tests --style sass --routing`\r\n2. switch to the generated project dir `cd test`\r\n3. run `npm i -D @angular-builders/custom-webpack pug pug-loader apply-loader`\r\n4. add `custom-webpack.config.js` file below\r\n5. edit `angular.json` as per the `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` documentation to use `custom-webpack.config.js`\r\n    - https://github.com/entith/ng-cli-pug-template-variable-issue/blob/master/angular.json\r\n8. run `ng g component test`\r\n9. edit the component and its template file to match the example above\r\n10. run `ng serve` and wait for project to build\r\n    - project should compile and server start with no errors\r\n    - page should load in browser as expected\r\n11. make any non-breaking change to a project file and save to trigger a rebuild\r\n    - ex: add a space at the end of a line in the `test.component.pug` file\r\n    - the project should rebuild, print `: Compiled successfully`, and then a moment later the error should print\r\n    - the page should have correctly refeshed\r\n        - if you make any template changes or changed the `items` array in the component, the page should correctly reflect these changes\r\n\r\n`custom-webpack.config.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = (config, options, targetOptions) => {\r\n  config.module.rules.push(\r\n    {\r\n      test: /\\.pug$/,\r\n      use: [\r\n        { loader: \"apply-loader\" },\r\n        { loader: \"pug-loader\" }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n \r\n  return config;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n> ng serve\r\n\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 20.6 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 141 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.15 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 12.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 3 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\nDate: 2020-07-17T20:50:39.902Z - Hash: 6232187f38b85c2dde79 - Time: 5839ms\r\n** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\nDate: 2020-07-17T20:50:44.744Z - Hash: d0680cf93388498b9aa8\r\n4 unchanged chunks\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 20.6 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nTime: 198ms\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n    \r\n    ERROR in src/app/test/test.component.pug:4:36 - error TS2551: Property 'item' does not exist on type 'TestComponent'.

We then have a shell application which collects information about all microservices and loads the frontends of those services into the shell so that they are usable for the user.\r\n\r\nEach service also comes with a standalone mode, which currently is just a really small angular app that wraps the module which is normally lazy-loaded into the shell.\r\n\r\nWith time the requirement came, that the standalone shells of the services should contain some basic functionalities, which the main shell also provides, like for example a logout button or a forbidden page.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to create a npm library which contains a StandaloneShellModule, which acts as the AppModule for those standalone shells and provides those basic functionalities i mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe original problem i faced, was that angular complained that my StandaloneShellModule is not part of the typescript compilation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/@company/shell/lib/standalone-shell.module.d.ts\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js):\r\nError: D:\\project\\frontend\\node_modules\\@company\\shell\\lib\\standalone-shell.module.d.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.\r\nThe missing file seems to be part of a third party library. TS files in published libraries are often a sign of a badly packaged library. Please open an issue in the library repository to alert its author and ask them to package the library using the Angular Package Format (https://goo.gl/jB3GVv).\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then found out that the cli for some reason rewrites the imports for `platformBrowserDynamic` and the module given to `bootstrapModule`. The compiled main.js looked something like this.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport * as __NgCli_bootstrap_1 from \"./../node_modules/@company/shell/lib/standalone-shell.module.d\";\r\nimport * as __NgCli_bootstrap_2 from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n    enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\n__NgCli_bootstrap_2.platformBrowser().bootstrapModule(__NgCli_bootstrap_1.StandaloneShellModule)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI searched for the place where this happened in the cli and found this file.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/transformers/replace_bootstrap.ts\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI do not provide a reproduction, because the issue is more of a question why the CLI is designed this way and why it does not support third party modules to be bootstrapped.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 14.4.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.1\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18286","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bootstrap Module cannot be from library\" (#18286)"},{"Id":"659269046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-17T13:44:19","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18285","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): flatten child compilation errors and warnings","State":"open","Body":"\r\nCloses #18231","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18285","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): flatten child compilation errors and warnings\" (#18285)"},{"Id":"659212590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-17T12:16:21","Actor":"JSmithOner","Number":"18284","RawContent":null,"Title":"When serving es5 ngx-socket-io gives me error","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nFrom what I remember it didn't worked with angular 9 either\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> .\r\nI'm using an old IPad 2 for development and just upgraded to angular 10.

Includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n### fix(compiler-cli): correctly detect deferred dependencies across scoped nodes\r\n\r\nThis is based on an internal issue report.\r\n\r\nAn earlier change introduced a diagnostic to report cases where a symbol is in the `deferredImports` array, but is used eagerly. The check worked by looking through the deferred blocks in a scope, resolving the scope for each and checking if the element is within the scope. The problem is that resolving the scope won't work across scoped node boundaries. For example, if there's a control flow statement around the block or within the block but around the deferred dependency, it won't be able to resolve the scope since it isn't a direct child, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (true) {\r\n  @defer {\r\n   <deferred-dep/>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this the case where the deferred block is inside a scoped node, I've changed the `R3BoundTarget.deferBlocks` to be a `Map` holding both the deferred block and its corresponding scope. Then to resolve the case where the dependency is within a scoped node inside the deferred block, I've added a depth-first traversal through the scopes within the deferred block.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): move defer block tests into separate file\r\nSplits the tests for `@defer` blocks out into a separate file since the `ngtsc_spec.ts` is getting quite large.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54499","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Correctly detect deferred dependencies inside scoped node and reorganize defer tests\" (#54499)"},{"Id":"2141044985","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T08:33:23","Actor":"JefriReynaldi","Number":"54493","RawContent":null,"Title":"Create devcontainer.json","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The `ngNonBindable` directive seems to work fine on the mustache/interpolation strings, such as `{{ test }}`, but it still tries to bind `[inputs]` and `(outputs)` within the snippet. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<code ngNonBindable> <!-- the placement of the directive doesn't seem to matter -->\r\n<pre><my-comp\r\n    (test)=\"test = test.toUpperCase()\"\r\n  ></my-comp></pre>\r\n</code>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailing with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'setAttribute' on 'Element': '(test)' is not a valid attribute name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, it's only half-useful and a bit contradictory to its name.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nFirst off, I don't know Angular internals around this subject well enough, so it is difficult for me to propose a solution. \r\n\r\nFrom DX PoV, I would like to be able to grab any piece of Angular template code, enclose it in a `<code><pre>` markup, drop the `ngNonBindable` and be done. Later, should I need to update the code part, I'd just paste new code. All without HTML escaping hassle.\r\n\r\nFor this flow to be possible I'd expect the `ngNonBindable` directive to do what it says, and literally stop binding anything that lies within its scope. `Anything` includes: inputs, outputs, attribute directives, structural directives, new control flow blocks, `<ng-template>`s, `<ng-container>`s, `<ng-content>`, etc. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/681956/d8237d90-15f1-4a5a-9439-5f0c4000b6f7)\r\n\r\nI imagine that with this in place, IDEs' syntax highlighting could render the code within `ngNonBindable` with dimmed colors or as regular HTML - which at that time would be aligned with the actual directive behavior.\r\n\r\nOr maybe this directive could become a new code flow syntax element?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/681956/d938400b-60b3-4915-96a7-21edd8c95642)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to just escape html, but one would expect the `ngNonBindable` directive to work exactly as its name implies. You just drop-in your real working code, add `ngNonBindable` and you're done.\r\nAlso, having to escape the html makes the code hardly maintainable. Overall, poor DX.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make ngNonBindable totally non-bindable\" (#54488)"},{"Id":"2139977321","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-17T11:19:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"54487","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): add the ability to treat object literals as enums in docs","State":"open","Body":"We have a couple of cases now (#53753 and #54414) where we're forced to redefine enums as object literals.

It appears that the optimization flag might be the culprit, as enabling it causes the issue to resurface. Despite the hydration not fully working, it's crucial to address this issue.

It's working perfectly, both with `ng build` and `ng serve`. It uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` builder. To support a new feature, I needed to swap a file when running the live-reload mode with `ng serve`. Following the documentation for `fileReplacements`, I added:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n            \"serve\": {\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n              \"ssr\": false\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI now get the following error when running `ng serve`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe regex pattern does not match what builds without replacement are actually using. Regular builds support `\"\\.(([cm]?[jt])sx?|json)$\"`. However, the pattern itself is questionable: why even limit the file extensions here? I don't need it right now, but what if I wanted to swap a `.wasm` file or any other kind of file? If a regular build works, adding a file replacement rule should never restrict it more.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd a file replacement rule targeting an `mts` file. Example:\r\n```\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.mts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.serve.mts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the corresponding command (`ng build`, `ng serve`)\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/fileReplacements/0/replace\" must match pattern \"\\.(([cm]?j|t)sx?|json)$\".\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n$ ng version\r\nNode.js version v21.6.1 detected.\r\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

Those templates are made for a specific CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 4). Developers using this framework might have or want to use a different CSS/HTML Library (for example Bootstrap 5). I want to update the framework to support multiple of those CSS/HTML Libraries. Unfortunately there is no option in angular at the moment to reach this goal, so all the logic must be applied before starting the building process. Also multiple html files make the project more complex. It would be better to have a preprocessor (like in C or other languages) to mark an area in the html template to be used if a compiler flag was set or some environment variable was set. One html template can contain html code for several different CSS/HTML Libraries.\r\n\r\nWhy a preprocessor step? I can also achieve the same by setting a global variable and some *ngIf statements in the html. But those logic + additional html for all CSS/HTML Libraries will be stored in the final product and generates an unnecessary overhead.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroducing variables which are considered at compile time, to include / not include parts of the html template. Those variables must be global or can be configured in the angular.json as an option like:\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap4\"}\r\n\r\nin another project\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap5\"}\r\n\r\nand used in the html template (example can be different)\r\n\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap4>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 4 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap5>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 5 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEnhance the optimizier, to remove parts of the html which are not used at all. For example, a const global variable which will never change and set to value like \"bootstrap4\" / \"bootstrap5\" must be considered.\r\n\r\nIssues / Problems: Global variables can't be used in html templates and must be re-defined in components. The variable in the component is not a global variable anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27123","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for multiple CSS Frameworks / Partial Build depends on Environment Variables\" (#27123)"},{"Id":"2143009778","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T14:22:50","Actor":"jcompagner","Number":"27131","RawContent":null,"Title":"new application builder and dynamic imports, ignore resources that are not there on the server (404)","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\nI want to move to the new application builder, so moving a way from the browser builder that we have that was build on top of webpack.\r\n\r\nProblem is we did a lot of code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst localeId = country !== undefined && country.length > 0 ?\r\n            language.toLowerCase() + '-' + country.toUpperCase() : language.toLowerCase();\r\n        return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            import(`@angular/common/locales/${localeId}.js`).then(\r\n                module => {\r\n                    registerLocaleData(module.default, localeId);\r\n                    resolve(localeId);\r\n                },\r\n                () => {\r\n                    import(`@angular/common/locales/${language.toLowerCase()}.js`).then(module => {\r\n                        registerLocaleData(module.default, localeId.split('-')[0]);\r\n                        resolve(language.toLowerCase());\r\n                    }, reject);\r\n                });\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nwebpack handled everything for that including the copy of those resources\r\nNow copying those resources is not the biggest problem, i can do that manually through a angular.json assets>glob entry\r\n\r\nthe loading it kind of works, except that the browser always gives an error of a none existing resource, even if i catch it through a reject handler of import().then(),catch()\r\nI don't want errors in the console for that, i know some files are not there, it completely depends if that file is shipping based on the locale string of the browser.

It can run the build step before jest runs. This allows us to run  `jest --runInBand` ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to add a `--runInBand` ng test flag for jest.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've currently invented a workaround. Unfortunately, without a proper `ng test --build` command, I had to revert to `ng test || exit 0`. This will build _and run the tests once_ before debugging can start. The necessary `sourceMapPathOverrides` are hideous as well 🙈\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>launch.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ng test (jest)\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm: test:build\",\r\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n        \"--experimental-vm-modules\",\r\n        \"./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js\",\r\n        \"--runInBand\",\r\n        \"--rootDir\",\r\n        \"${workspaceFolder}/dist/test-out/browser\",\r\n        \"--testMatch\",\r\n        \"**/?(*.)+(spec|test).mjs\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\r\n        \"src/app/*\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src/app/*\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"outputCapture\": \"std\",\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.mjs\"]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>package.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"test:build\": \"npm test || exit 0\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</summary>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to debug jest tests?\" (#27117)"},{"Id":"2138549250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T12:41:15","Actor":"sod","Number":"27116","RawContent":null,"Title":"`externalPackagesPlugin` slows down `ng serve` substantially","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] Kinda, as the `externalPackagesPlugin` was just added via https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923 existed, which was part of [17.1.1](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.1), so I guess angular [17.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.0)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nangular 17.2.0\r\nvite/esbuild powered application builder\r\n\r\nUsing the `loader` option in `angular.json` like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\", \".svg\": \"text\" },\r\n```\r\n\r\nto support images as ecmascript imports or svgs as inline. This causes angular-cli to add the `externalPackagesPlugin` which is a giant hit on build performance. For our apps:\r\n\r\n| angular version | watch rebuild time |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| angular 17.1.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `0.8 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.1.1 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.2.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n\r\nThose additional 5.2 seconds are also added to the initial build.\r\n\r\nMy rough idea of the issue is, that the `externalPackagesPlugin` looks at every single import that doesn't start with `.` or `/` and doesn't cache the results. So tons of `@angular/...`, `rxjs`, `@ngrx/...` and similar imports are resolved over and over again. Even if this function only needs 2ms to run, this quickly adds up.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sod/ng-serve-external-deps-slowdown\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/905328/88202539-c585-4240-b0b3-98154559cc73)\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the `development` and `development-slow` configurations in the angular.json are:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n            \"development\": {\r\n            },\r\n            \"development-slow\": {\r\n              \"loader\": {\r\n                \".webp\": \"file\"\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Your

[`v0.20.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0201)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1)\n\n-   Fix a bug with the CSS nesting transform ([#&#8203;3648](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3648))\n\n    This release fixes a bug with the CSS nesting transform for older browsers where the generated CSS could be incorrect if a selector list contained a pseudo element followed by another selector. The bug was caused by incorrectly mutating the parent rule's selector list when filtering out pseudo elements for the child rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      &:after,\n      & .bar {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo .bar,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */\n    .foo:after,\n    .foo .bar {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Constant folding for JavaScript inequality operators ([#&#8203;3645](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3645))\n\n    This release introduces constant folding for the `< > <= >=` operators. The minifier will now replace these operators with `true` or `false` when both sides are compile-time numeric or string constants:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(1 < 2, '🍕' > '🧀')\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(1<2,\"🍕\">\"🧀\");\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(!0,!1);\n    ```\n\n-   Better handling of `__proto__` edge cases ([#&#8203;3651](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3651))\n\n    JavaScript object literal syntax contains a special case where a non-computed property with a key of `__proto__` sets the prototype of the object. This does not apply to computed properties or to properties that use the shorthand property syntax introduced in ES6. Previously esbuild didn't correctly preserve the \"sets the prototype\" status of properties inside an object literal, meaning a property that sets the prototype could accidentally be transformed into one that doesn't and vice versa. This has now been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ } // Note: sets the prototype\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__ = proto\n        return { __proto__ } // Note: doesn't set the prototype\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__ }; // Note: no longer sets the prototype (WRONG)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { __proto__: __proto__2 }; // Note: now sets the prototype (WRONG)\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    function foo(__proto__) {\n      return { __proto__: __proto__ }; // Note: sets the prototype (correct)\n    }\n    function bar(__proto__, proto) {\n      {\n        let __proto__2 = proto;\n        return { [\"__proto__\"]: __proto__2 }; // Note: doesn't set the prototype (correct)\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix cross-platform non-determinism with CSS color space transformations ([#&#8203;3650](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3650))\n\n    The Go compiler takes advantage of \"fused multiply and add\" (FMA) instructions on certain processors which do the operation `x*y + z` without intermediate rounding. This causes esbuild's CSS color space math to differ on different processors (currently `ppc64le` and `s390x`), which breaks esbuild's guarantee of deterministic output. To avoid this, esbuild's color space math now inserts a `float64()` cast around every single math operation. This tells the Go compiler not to use the FMA optimization.\n\n-   Fix a crash when resolving a path from a directory that doesn't exist ([#&#8203;3634](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3634))\n\n    This release fixes a regression where esbuild could crash when resolving an absolute path if the source directory for the path resolution operation doesn't exist. While this situation doesn't normally come up, it could come up when running esbuild concurrently with another operation that mutates the file system as esbuild is doing a build (such as using `git` to switch branches). The underlying problem was a regression that was introduced in version 0.18.0.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents (https-proxy-agent)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.4`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#704)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@7.0.3...https-proxy-agent@7.0.4)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   [`b88ab46`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/b88ab46): Import `url` instead of `node:url` 🤷‍♂️\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.15`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.14...inquirer@9.2.15)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>piscinajs/piscina (piscina)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.2`](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#432-2024-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/piscinajs/piscina/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.2)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.12.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.11.0...v4.12.0)\n\n*2024-02-16*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Improve raw bundling performance by 10-15% when not using the cache or plugins that return an AST ([#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5391))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5391): Improve performance by directly constructing AST from buffer ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5393](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5393): chore(deps): update dependency eslint-plugin-unicorn to v51 ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5394](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5394): chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v7 (major) ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n-   [#&#8203;5395](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5395): chore(deps): lock file maintenance minor/patch updates ([@&#8203;renovate](https://togithub.com/renovate)\\[bot])\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.71.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1710)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.70.0...1.71.0)\n\nFor more information about `pkg:` importers, see [the\nannouncement][pkg-importers] on the Sass blog.\n\n[pkg-importers]: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-pkg-importers\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Add a `--pkg-importer` flag to enable built-in `pkg:` importers.

As you are aware, Material 3 for the web heavily relies on CSS custom properties, and this adjustment would be more in line with the framework's theming approach.\r\n\r\nThe suggested change aligns with Material 3's philosophy of emitting only CSS custom property declarations, avoiding standard CSS properties (refer to https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#applying-your-theme). Importantly, this approach remains fully compatible with the current Material 2 themes implementation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, incorporating CSS custom properties will streamline the organization of CSS rules by allowing them to be centralized directly in the component's stylesheet. This centralization mitigates the challenges associated with splitting rules across multiple files, resulting in a more manageable and less error-prone maintenance process. It is worth noting that this approach enhances component autonomy, making theming optional, as custom properties can be set outside of a theme. This flexibility ensures a smoother development and maintenance experience.\r\n\r\nImplementing this proposal would greatly assist developers in their future migration from Material 2 to 3, requiring only changes to flat custom properties isolated in mixins. Additionally, it opens the door to granular customizations with CSS custom properties (see https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3#granular-customizations-with-css-custom-properties) even before material 3 integration becomes stable. Embracing CSS custom properties aligns with modern best practices and ensures future-proofing.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this proposal.\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// carousel.scss\r\n\r\n.my-carousel {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  color: var(--app-carousel-color);\r\n  font-family: var(--app-carousel-font-family);\r\n  padding: var(--app-carousel-padding);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.my-carousel-button {\r\n  border-radius: var(--app-carousel-shape, 4px);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-color: #{mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-font-family: #{mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1)};\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin density($theme) {\r\n  --app-carousel-padding: #{48px + (2px * mat.get-theme-density($theme))};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28612","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): Change components theming guide to encourage css custom properties\" (#28612)"},{"Id":"2141888232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T09:46:14","Actor":"landoephan","Number":"28611","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): programmatically focused link gets focused, but the style doesn't apply","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to focus a link programmatically.

When setting the width of the dialog element to 100%, it may not occupy the entire width of the viewport as intended. Instead, it might get pushed to the left side of the screen, causing it to appear off-center or misaligned.\r\n3.

As we can format thumb label text by using **displayWith** property and add suffix or prefix to the number.

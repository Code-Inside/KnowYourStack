Effectively, we need to serialize 2 pieces of info: (1) hydration info for the root component itself and (2) hydration info for the ViewContainerRef instance (an LContainer). Each piece of information is included into the hydration data (in the TransferState object) separately, thus we end up with 2 ids. Since we only have 1 root element, we encode both bits of info into a single string: ids are separated by the `|` char (e.g. `10|25`, where `10` is the `ngh` for a component view and 25 is the `ngh` for a root view which holds LContainer).\r\n\r\nPreviously, we were only including component-related information, thus all the views in the view container remained dehydrated and duplicated (client-rendered from scratch) on the client.\r\n\r\nResolves #51157.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51247","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): handle hydration of view containers for root components\" (#51247)"},{"Id":"1832146364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-01T23:03:18","Actor":"jsaguet","Number":"51246","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(service-worker): remove backward compatibility code","State":"open","Body":"Remove backward compatibility code from service worker package.\r\n\r\nThe changes related to navigationUrls were introduced in d49d1e7d738369abbb6b923f6ab0b1f845596763.\r\nThe changes related to old SW cache were introduced in 2326b9c2940ed99748d25ab047350ca1f5fd7e45 and later updated in e721c08c\r\n\r\nFixes #43403\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #43403\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51246","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(service-worker): remove backward compatibility code\" (#51246)"},{"Id":"1831939781","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-01T20:08:09","Actor":"ddamiankowalski","Number":"51244","RawContent":null,"Title":"Async pipe used inside an HTML template does not get the latest values","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I am trying to subscribe to an Observable  using an async pipe, the template does not seems to be subscribing correctly.

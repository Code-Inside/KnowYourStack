Vitest is configured as the test runner.\n\n1. Building tests works but running tests fails with the error: \"No test files found.\" if you launch ng test with a Windows path:\n```\nng test --browsers Chromium --include \"C:\\client\\src\\app\\header\\header.component.spec.ts\"\n```\n\n2. Building and running tests work if you launch ng test with a quasi-POSIX path on Windows:\n```\nng test --browsers Chromium --include \"C:/client/src/app/header/header.component.spec.ts\"\n```\n\n3. Building tests fails if you launch ng test with a full POSIX path on Windows:\n```\nng test --browsers Chromium --include \"/c/client/src/app/header/header.component.spec.ts\"\n```\n\nSince the native Windows path is not working, you can't use ${file} in launch.json of Visual Studio Code. Similarly, the full POSIX path ${command:extension.commandvariable.file.filePosix}\" is not working either. This prevents the launching of the current test file on Windows.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nReproduced with 21.0.0-next.7\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your

Specifically, using @angular/material@20.2.7, MatDrawer has changed from not having an animation to having it multiple times:\n\n- Did not have animation at some point before 06/10/2025 (don't remember the exact date, in this case with @angular/material@20.2.5)\n- Had an animation at 06/10/2025, 9:50 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.5 or @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did not have an animation at 08/10/2025, 11:48 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n- Did have an animation at 10/10/2025, 12:19 UTC (with @angular/material@20.2.7)\n\nI have also observed these changes in the examples in [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples), which have suffered the same changes in animations in the same dates, but I cannot assure they have not changed the @angular/material version used.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- Create an Angular application that uses MatDrawer, install dependencies just once, and check how the drawer changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates.\n- Or check how [https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples](https://material.angular.dev/components/sidenav/examples) changes from having an animation to not having it in different dates (in some cases without a release).\n\nI know this is not easy to check if nobody else has noticed and it does not happen in the future (that would be fine). But if it happens again in the future, this will help resolve it.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material changes behaviour only with a version change\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAngular Material changes behaviour without a version change\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.3.3\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.7\n- Browser(s): Edge/Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32051","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material changes behaviour without a version change\" (#32051)"},{"Id":"3501242452","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T11:58:00","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"32048","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: sync border-radius with by replacing --mat-sys-corner-large to …","State":"closed","Body":"Before:\r\n<img width=\"740\" height=\"691\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6acca1d-53c3-4236-93fa-72623423f214\" />\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"740\" height=\"691\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9feb891-4b14-4e6a-8e50-0fc7f660bc4f\" />\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32048","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: sync border-radius with by replacing --mat-sys-corner-large to …\" (#32048)"},{"Id":"3501375340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T10:22:52","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32049","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| @&#8203;bazel/ibazel | [`^0.26.0` -> `^0.27.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fibazel/0.26.10/0.27.0) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/@bazel%2fibazel/0.27.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/@bazel%2fibazel/0.27.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/@bazel%2fibazel/0.26.10/0.27.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/@bazel%2fibazel/0.26.10/0.27.0?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n| [firebase-tools](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | [`14.18.0` -> `14.19.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/14.18.0/14.19.1) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/firebase-tools/14.19.1?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/firebase-tools/14.19.1?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/firebase-tools/14.18.0/14.19.1?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/firebase-tools/14.18.0/14.19.1?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.19.1`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.19.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.19.0...v14.19.1)\n\n- Fix a bug where CloudSQL instances creation fails.

This would enable more nuanced control than the current `cdkDragBoundary`, which enforces containment uniformly on all sides.\n\n**Proposed API (example):**\n\n<img width=\"712\" height=\"229\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4c3a6da-599b-4b00-82d1-4441d378fbec\" />\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n**1. MatDialog Handle Visibility Constraint**\nEnable users to drag a MatDialog freely within a grid layout, but restrict movement beyond the top and left/right edges of the viewport to ensure the dialog’s drag handle remains visible and accessible. This prevents scenarios where users accidentally drag the dialog off-screen, making it difficult or impossible to reposition without refreshing the page or resetting the layout.\n\n- Preserves usability by keeping the drag handle within reach.\n\n- Prevents frustration from dialogs becoming “lost” off-screen.\n\n- Supports responsive design by adapting to dynamic viewport sizes.\n\n**2. Dashboard Layout Editors**\nAllow users to drag widgets freely within a grid but prevent them from overlapping fixed headers or sidebars. For example:\n\n- Restrict dragging above the top edge to preserve a sticky toolbar.\n\n- Allow overflow on the bottom for expandable panels.\n\n**3. Mobile UI Builders**\nIn mobile layout editors, you might want to:\n\n- Prevent dragging past the left/right edges to maintain responsive design.\n\n- Allow vertical overflow for scrollable content zones.\n\n**4. Game Interfaces**\nIn drag-based puzzle or strategy games:\n\n- Restrict dragging outside the playfield on specific sides (e.g., prevent dragging off the top to simulate gravity).\n\n- Allow dragging into inventory zones only from certain directions.\n\n**5. Design Tools (e.g., Canva-style editors)**\nEnable asymmetric drag zones:\n\n- Prevent dragging elements off the canvas on the left and top (to preserve alignment).\n\n- Allow overflow on the right for snapping to guides or external panels.\n\n**6. Workflow Builders / Flowchart Editors**\nWhen building visual workflows:\n\n- Restrict dragging nodes above the top boundary to avoid overlapping with global controls.\n\n- Allow dragging below for expanding the flow.\n\n**7. Accessibility-Driven Interfaces**\nFor users with motor impairments:\n\n- Restrict dragging to safe zones to prevent accidental loss of visibility.\n\n- Customize side restrictions based on user preferences or device orientation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32044","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdkDrag): Restrict drag movement by individual boundary sides (top, right, bottom, left)\" (#32044)"},{"Id":"3497123815","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-09T17:40:59","Actor":"lekhmanrus","Number":"32035","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove redundant 'this' for cleaner templates","State":"closed","Body":"Small style refactoring.

Has no effect if node is not expandable.\r\n * Add NestedTreeControlOptions#isExpandable function, determines if argument tree node can be expanded or collapsed.\r\n\r\nFor trees using treeControl, recommend providing isExpandable if not already provided. See “Deprecated” for more information on updating applications.\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: use CdkTree to manage expansion state\r\n * Add CdkTree#isExpanded method.\r\n * Add CdkTree#toggle, CdkTree#expand and CdkTree#collapse methods.\r\n * Add  CdkTree#toggleDescendants, CdkTree#expandDescendants, and CdkTree#collapseDescendants methods to CdkTree\r\n * Add CdkTree#expandAll and CdkTree#collapseAll methods\r\n * Add expandedChange Output to CdkTreeNode\r\n\r\nAPI ADDITION: add injection token for tree-key-manager\r\n * Add TREE_KEY_MANAGER injection token. When provided, tree uses given key manager\r\n * TreeKeyManagerStrategy interface, which defines API contract of TREE_KEY_MANAGER\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR CHANGE: MatTree and CdkTree components respond to keyboard navigation.\r\n * CdkTree and MatTree respond to arrow keys, page up, page down, etc.; Keyboard commands match [WAI ARIA Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).\r\n * Can no longer set the tabindex on MatTreeNode. See “Deprecated” for adopting existing applications.\r\n * Add TreeKeyManager to cdk/a11y\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: Tree controller deprecated. Use one of levelAccessor or childrenAccessor instead. To be removed in a future version.\r\n * BaseTreeControl, TreeControl, FlatTreeControl, and NestedTreeControl deprecated\r\n * CdkTree#treeControl deprecated. Provide one of CdkTree#levelAccessor or CdkTree#childrenAccessor instead.\r\n * MatTreeFlattener deprecated. Use MatTree#childrenAccessor and MatTreeNode#isExpandable instead.\r\n * MatTreeFlatDataSource deprecated. Use one of levelAccessor or childrenAccessor instead of TreeControl.\r\n\r\nNote when upgrading: isExpandable works differently on Trees using treeControl than trees using childrenAccessor or levelAccessor. Nodes on trees that have a treeControl are expandable by default. Nodes on trees using childrenAccessor or levelAccessor are *not* expandable by default. Provide isExpandable to override default behavior.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: Setting tabindex of tree nodes deprecated. By default, Tree ignores tabindex passed to tree nodes.\r\n * MatTreeNode#tabIndex deprecated. MatTreeNode ignores Input tabIndex and manages its own focus behavior.\r\n * MatTreeNode#defaultTabIndex deprecated. MatTreeNode ignores defaultTabIndex and manages its own focus behavior.\r\n * MatNestedTreeNode#tabIndex deprecated. MatTreeNode ignores Input defaultTabIndex and manages its own focus behavior.\r\n * LegacyTreeKeyManager and LEGACY_TREE_KEY_MANAGER_FACTORY_PROVIDER deprecated. Inject a TreeKeyManagerFactory to customize keyboard behavior.\r\n\r\nNote when upgrading: an opt-out is available for keyboard functionality changes. Provide LEGACY_TREE_KEY_MANAGER_FACTORY_PROVIDER to opt-out of Tree managing its own focus. When provided, Tree does not manage it’s own focus and respects tabindex passed to TreeNode. When provided, have the same focus behavior as before this commit is applied.\r\n\r\nAdd Legacy Keyboard Interface demo, which shows usage of LEGACY_TREE_KEY_MANAGER_FACTORY_PROVIDER. Add Custom Key Manager, which shows usage of injecting a TreeKeyManagerStrategy\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED: disabled renamed to isDisabled.\r\n * CdkTreeNode#disabled deprecated and alias to CdkTreeNode#isDisabled","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tree): add levelAccessor, childrenAccessor, TreeKeyManag…\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"1982294629","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-08T21:55:58","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cdk tree revamp merge2","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28072","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Cdk tree revamp merge2\" (#28072)"},{"Id":"1983864352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-08T18:50:49","Actor":"Vbuddies","Number":"28084","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mdc-icon-button): adding border to mat-icon-button causes icon to become misaligned","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the basic implementation of mat-icon-button the icon inside the button is properly aligned as expected within the button.

This is confusing to users if they don't realize they need to remove focus from the chips field in order for the element to become enabled.\r\n* When a required chips component is the last field in a form, followed by a conditionally disabled submit button and a cancel button, a user may accidentally hit the cancel button if they attempt to tab to the submit button.\r\n* With chips that can be dragged and dropped, the chips field does not necessarily receive focus when chips are moved around. This results in chips being visibly moved, but the form control value does not get updated. Since order generally matters for chips that can be dragged and dropped, a user could get the desired order visually, while a different order gets persisted upon submission.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-chips-bug-f6octd?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a required chips field followed by a submit button conditionally enabled by the validation of the preceding field\r\n2. Focus on chips input\r\n3. Select option or type out input\r\n4. Hit **Enter** key on keyboard\r\n5. Hit **Tab** key on keyboard\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe submit button should receive focus because it is enabled after hitting **Enter** in the chips field. The chips form control value should be updated immediately when a chip is created.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe submit button does not receive focus.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.12\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.11\r\n- Browser(s): Tested in Chrome and Firefox, likely reproducible in others\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Tested in Windows, likely reproducible in others\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatChipGrid): Chips form controls do not update values until focus is achieved and lost\" (#28065)"},{"Id":"1980141768","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-06T22:00:23","Actor":"smoothiesrock","Number":"28064","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(stepper): Can't find any documentation on changing the default mat-step-header tabindex","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nI'm unable to find any supporting documentation for programmatically overriding the default mat-step-header tabindex behavior in any of the stepper variants.

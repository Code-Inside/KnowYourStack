I'm not sure if this a bug or not (perhaps not), maybe it should be just an improvement. That said, I'd still like to understand what's going on, because I've wasted a lot of time looking in a completely wrong place.\r\n\r\nIn the example provided in the link, when you click the button, a new component appears. The (fabricated for this example) purpose was for it to update the two props above (by pushing a new value into an observable that resides within a shared service between child and parent and parent subscribes to it) - but it doesn't happen. When you click it again, you finally see it (next change detection triggered, obviously).\r\n\r\nAfter a long and arduous process, now **I do know** what's wrong here and how to fix it with regards to change detection cycle, child updating parent's DOM in the same change detection macrotask, etc. What I'm not sure about is: **why the error isn't thrown**, when it's clearly a case of a new value being pushed in the same tick after the parent DOM update (which is clearly demonstrated by the values not updating the first time)?\r\n\r\nYou can easily influence this by pushing two objects in HelloComponent or by pushing just an empty array into observable in parent, instead of initial object. Then, you would (correctly) see the standard ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError error, as expected.\r\n\r\nIt's still an overwrite with a new reference to a new array, so how the comparison works here behind the scenes? Why the expression (*ngFor in this case, in parent) is apparently evaluated to \"the same value\" and thus not throwing an error, even if it obviously contains a new array with another object filled with props with another values? Is it because *ngFor interpolates to a string at this stage (or uses some other simplification, like only checking array length, comparing by shallow value etc.)?\r\n\r\nSeems like the error should be thrown here. It might be \"working as intended\", but that \"intended\" is confusing without a warning.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-jkshfv?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhello.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nIt's one of these unusual cases, where I would actually like to see an error, but I don't see it :)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 12.1.0\r\nNode: 14.17.4\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1201.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             12.1.0\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.3.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI do realize that this borderlines on a support request, but, again, the intention here is to improve the framework to throw some kind of warning for these cases, as opposed to doing nothing, as it is right now.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44277","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected supression (or undetected) ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError \" (#44277)"},{"Id":"1063447145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T11:05:57","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"44276","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): clean up tests relying on entryComponents","State":"open","Body":"Cleans up all the tests that had to declare a separate module in order to pass in `entryComponents` when creating components dynamically.

brought ranges for warnings and errors, smaller `node_modules` size, lazy parsing to avoid `PostCSS does nothing` warning, and TypeScript fixes.\n\n#### Thanks to Sponsors\n\nThis release was possible thanks to our community.\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\" alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\"

[**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Rages for Errors and Warnings\n\n[@&#8203;adalinesimonian](https://togithub.com/adalinesimonian), the author of amazing [Stylelint extension](https://togithub.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint) for VS Code, added ranges to errors and warnings.\n\n```js\nresult.warn(msg, { index })           // One character warning at index\nresult.warn(msg, { endIndex })        // Starts at node start, ends at endIndex\nresult.warn(msg, { index, endIndex }) // Starts at index, ends at endIndex\nresult.warn(msg, { start })           // Starts at start, ends at node end\nresult.warn(msg, { end })             // Starts at node start, ends at end\nresult.warn(msg, { start, end })      // Starts at start, ends at end\nresult.warn(msg, { word })            // Starts at word location, ends at word index + length\n```\n\nIt will improve DX in the IDE extension.\n\n#### Lazy Parsing\n\nPreviously, we found that many tools run PostCSS even if the developer didn’t pass any PostCSS plugins. Parsing is the most expensive step in CSS processing. It led to a waste of resources without any reason.\n\nWe tried to resolve the problem by adding a `PostCSS does nothing` warning. But it didn’t force tool authors to be more careful with user’s resources.\n\nIf PostCSS sees that tool call it without passing plugins (or changing parser/stringifier), PostCSS will not parse CSS (until toll will call `Result#root`). In 8.4, [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://togithub.com/bogdan0083) (with the help of [@&#8203;WilhelmYakunin](https://togithub.com/WilhelmYakunin)) tries to solve the problem in another way. It allows us to save resources and remove the `PostCSS does nothing` warning.\n\n```js\n// No plugins, we do not parse CSS\nlet result = await postcss().process(css, { from  })\nresult.css  // Is the same string passed to process()\nresult.map  // Special 1-to-1 source map\nresult.root // CSS will parsed only here\n```\n\n#### Install Size Reduction\n\nWith [≈60M weekly](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=postcss) downloads, PostCSS has responsibility for the world’s resource spending.\n\nTogether with [@&#8203;7rulnik](https://togithub.com/7rulnik) we [reduced](https://togithub.com/7rulnik/source-map-js/pull/7) [`source-map-js`](https://togithub.com/7rulnik/source-map-js) size. It is transitive dependency of PostCSS.\n\nIn 8.4, we moved to a fixed version of `source-map-js`, which reduced the `postcss` size in your `node_modules` from [≈1 MB to 0.3 MB](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=postcss). With the huge popularity of PostCSS, it will free a lot of resources on our CIs.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/143244369-9ec362c5-4dbd-4aff-ba9e-7b4a50a97484.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"392\" alt=\"PostCSS install size reduction\">\n#### Migration from Jest to `uvu`\n\n[@&#8203;kimoofey](https://togithub.com/kimoofey) refactored all tests from the popular Jest framework to small and fast [`uvu`](https://togithub.com/lukeed/uvu).\n\nIt will not affect end-users. However, it reduced our `node_modules` size by 33 MB and made tests twice faster (`yarn install & yarn unit`: 24 → 13 seconds).\n\n#### TypeScript Fixes\n\n-   Added `Processor` types.\n-   Added `Stringifier` types (by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j)).\n-   Fixed types `Root` and `Document` in result values (by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j)).\n-   Fixed `Node#walkRules()` types (by [@&#8203;hudochenkov](https://togithub.com/hudochenkov)).\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   Fixed docs (by [@&#8203;paulshryock](https://togithub.com/paulshryock)).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.43.5`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1435)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.43.4...1.43.5)\n\n-   Fix a bug where calculations with different operators were incorrectly\n    considered equal.\n\n-   Properly parse attribute selectors with empty namespaces.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Print more detailed JS stack traces.

`async` arrow functions ([#&#8203;1777](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1777))\n\n    This release fixes an edge case that was missed when lowering `async` arrow functions containing `super` property accesses for compile targets that don't support `async` such as with `--target=es6`. The problem was that lowering transforms `async` arrow functions into generator function expressions that are then passed to an esbuild helper function called `__async` that implements the `async` state machine behavior. Since function expressions do not capture `this` and `super` like arrow functions do, this led to a mismatch in behavior which meant that the transform was incorrect. The fix is to introduce a helper function to forward `super` access into the generator function expression body. Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() { return async () => super.bar() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() {\n        return () => __async(this, null, function* () {\n          return super.bar();\n        });\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      foo() {\n        return () => {\n          var __superGet = (key) => super[key];\n          return __async(this, null, function* () {\n            return __superGet(\"bar\").call(this);\n          });\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid merging certain CSS rules with different units ([#&#8203;1732](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1732))\n\n    This release no longer collapses `border-radius`, `margin`, `padding`, and `inset` rules when they have units with different levels of browser support. Collapsing multiple of these rules into a single rule is not equivalent if the browser supports one unit but not the other unit, since one rule would still have applied before the collapse but no longer applies after the collapse due to the whole rule being ignored. For example, Chrome 10 supports the `rem` unit but not the `vw` unit, so the CSS code below should render with rounded corners in Chrome 10. However, esbuild previously merged everything into a single rule which would cause Chrome 10 to ignore the rule and not round the corners. This issue is now fixed:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original CSS */\n    div {\n      border-radius: 1rem;\n      border-top-left-radius: 1vw;\n      margin: 0;\n      margin-top: 1Q;\n      left: 10Q;\n      top: 20Q;\n      right: 10Q;\n      bottom: 20Q;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    div{border-radius:1vw 1rem 1rem;margin:1Q 0 0;inset:20Q 10Q}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    div{border-radius:1rem;border-top-left-radius:1vw;margin:0;margin-top:1Q;inset:20Q 10Q}\n    ```\n\n    Notice how esbuild can still collapse rules together when they all share the same unit, even if the unit is one that doesn't have universal browser support such as the unit `Q`. One subtlety is that esbuild now distinguishes between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" units where safe units are old enough that they are guaranteed to work in any browser a user might reasonably use, such as `px`. Safe units are allowed to be collapsed together even if there are multiple different units while multiple different unsafe units are not allowed to be collapsed together. Another detail is that esbuild no longer minifies zero lengths by removing the unit if the unit is unsafe (e.g. `0rem` into `0`) since that could cause a rendering difference if a previously-ignored rule is now no longer ignored due to the unit change. If you are curious, you can learn more about browser support levels for different CSS units in [Mozilla's documentation about CSS length units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length).\n\n-   Avoid warning about ignored side-effect free imports for empty files ([#&#8203;1785](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1785))\n\n    When bundling, esbuild warns about bare imports such as `import \"lodash-es\"` when the package has been marked as `\"sideEffects\": false` in its `package.json` file. This is because the only reason to use a bare import is because you are relying on the side effects of the import, but imports for packages marked as side-effect free are supposed to be removed. If the package indicates that it has no side effects, then this bare import is likely a bug.\n\n    However, some people have packages just for TypeScript type definitions. These package can actually have a side effect as they can augment the type of the global object in TypeScript, even if they are marked with `\"sideEffects\": false`. To avoid warning in this case, esbuild will now only issue this warning if the imported file is non-empty. If the file is empty, then it's irrelevant whether you import it or not so any import of that file does not indicate a bug. This fixes this case because `.d.ts` files typically end up being empty after esbuild parses them since they typically only contain type declarations.\n\n-   Attempt to fix packages broken due to the `node:` prefix ([#&#8203;1760](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1760))\n\n    Some people have started using the node-specific `node:` path prefix in their packages. This prefix forces the following path to be interpreted as a node built-in module instead of a package on the file system. So `require(\"node:path\")` will always import [node's `path` module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) and never import [npm's `path` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path).\n\n    Adding the `node:` prefix breaks that code with older node versions that don't understand the `node:` prefix. This is a problem with the package, not with esbuild. The package should be adding a fallback if the `node:` prefix isn't available. However, people still want to be able to use these packages with older node versions even though the code is broken. Now esbuild will automatically strip this prefix if it detects that the code will break in the configured target environment (as specified by `--target=`). Note that this only happens during bundling, since import paths are only examined during bundling.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n###

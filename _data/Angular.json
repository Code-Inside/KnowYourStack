This creates unnecessary complexity for common API calls:\nCurrent approach:\ntypescript// Requires RxJS knowledge and imports\nimport { firstValueFrom } from 'rxjs';\nconst result = await firstValueFrom(this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users'));\nImpact on developer experience:\n\nSteep learning curve for developers from other frameworks\nVerbose code for simple HTTP operations\nCognitive overhead of understanding Observables for basic API calls\nInconsistent patterns across teams (some use .subscribe(), others firstValueFrom)\n\nProposed Solution\nAdd simple Promise-based helper functions that wrap the existing HttpClient:\ntypescript// Proposed simple API\nconst users = await callApiGet<User[]>('/api/users');\nconst newUser = await callApiPost<User>('/api/users', { name: 'John' });\nBenefits\n\nLower barrier to entry - Developers familiar with fetch() or other HTTP libraries can be immediately productive\nReduced boilerplate - Eliminates need for RxJS imports and conversions in 80% of HTTP use cases\nConsistent patterns -

Do Nothing (Status Quo)\nDescription: Keep current Observable-only HTTP approach\nPros: No additional maintenance burden, maintains consistency\nCons: Continues developer experience problems, high learning curve for newcomers\nRejected because: Ignores legitimate usability concerns affecting developer productivity\n2. Replace HttpClient Entirely with Promise-Based API\nDescription: Deprecate Observable HttpClient and create new Promise-based client\nPros: Clean, simple API without Observable complexity\nCons: Massive breaking change, loses Observable benefits for complex scenarios, huge migration effort\nRejected because: Would break existing applications and eliminate legitimate use cases for reactive programming\n3. Add Promise Methods Directly to HttpClient\nDescription: Extend HttpClient with .getPromise(), .postPromise() methods\nPros: Integrated into existing service, familiar injection pattern\nCons: Bloats HttpClient interface, mixing paradigms in same class creates confusion\nRejected because: Violates single responsibility principle and creates API inconsistency\n4. Third-Party Library Solution\nDescription: Let community create separate HTTP libraries (like axios for Angular)\nPros: No framework maintenance burden, market-driven solutions\nCons: Fragments ecosystem, bypasses Angular's interceptor system, inconsistent patterns across projects\nRejected because: Loses integration benefits and creates ecosystem fragmentation\n5. HTTP Utilities Package (Chosen Approach)\nDescription: Separate utility functions that wrap existing HttpClient\nPros:\n\nOptional adoption\nNo breaking changes\nPreserves Observable capabilities\nSimple to implement and maintain\nCan coexist with existing patterns\n\nSelected because: Provides developer experience improvements without architectural disruption or breaking changes.\nThis keeps the focus on technical alternatives rather than suggesting the problem is just a matter of education or training.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63638","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"how about some simple helper utlities\" (#63638)"},{"Id":"3393831498","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-08T11:52:42","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63637","RawContent":null,"Title":"test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63637","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test\" (#63637)"},{"Id":"3393441205","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-08T09:45:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"63636","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): introduce `BootstrapContext` for improved server bootstrapping","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a number of changes to the server bootstrapping process to make it more robust and less error-prone, especially for concurrent requests.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the server rendering process relied on a module-level global platform injector. This could lead to issues in server-side rendering environments where multiple requests are processed concurrently, as they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state.\r\n\r\nThe new approach introduces a `BootstrapContext` that is passed to the `bootstrapApplication` function. This context provides a platform reference that is scoped to the individual request, ensuring that each server-side render has an isolated platform injector. This prevents state leakage between concurrent requests and makes the overall process more reliable.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\nThe server-side bootstrapping process has been changed to eliminate the reliance on a global platform injector.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = () => bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = (context: BootstrapContext) =>\r\n  bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config, context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA schematic is provided to automatically update `main.server.ts` files to pass the `BootstrapContext` to the `bootstrapApplication` call.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `getPlatform()` and `destroyPlatform()` will now return `null` and be a no-op respectively when running in a server environment.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 8bf80c9d2314b4f2bcf3df83ae01552a6fc49834)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63636","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): introduce `BootstrapContext` for improved server bootstrapping\" (#63636)"},{"Id":"3392920470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-08T07:11:34","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63635","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (20.2.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Of those, the first field's value is logged using an `effect` that is accessing `this.form.first().value()`:\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [Control],\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n  template: `\n    <input [control]=\"form.first\"/>\n    <input [control]=\"form.second\"/>\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {\n  readonly form = form(signal({ first: '', second: '' }));\n\n  readonly logFirstEffect = effect(() => {\n    console.log(this.form.first().value());\n  });\n}\n```\n\nNotice that when typing in the second control, the effect still fires. This is because `this.form.first()` is re-computed.\n\nFor me, this was initially unexpected, and caused an infinite effect, when trying to conditional sync form values, which is a feature you seem willing to provide a native solution for in [[Design] fields whose value is sometimes computed from other fields](https://github.com/orgs/angular/projects/60/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=119849858).\n\nOne can, of course, circumvent this issue by memorising the value as\n```typescript\nreadonly firstValue = computed(() => this.form.first().value())\n```\n\nAs there is a general need to listen to individual field value changes in the spirit of `valueChanges` offered by reactive forms, be it via an `effect` or a `computed` signal, could you please consider on of the following:\n\n1.

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

But I am not sure where to file that, and this seems like this should be on the radar for the Material docs users using Firefox.\n\nI was trying to run Material doc examples in Firefox. After messing around, I was able to fix it by commenting out some of the root SCSS. In particular, something about the `@use '@angular/material' as mat` will cause Firefox ran Stackblitz projects to hang on the `\"ng serve --> Building...\"` phase in the terminal and `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\nBelow is what has to be done to any Material styled file to get them to work, nullifying theming.\n\n```scss\n// @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 30px;\n  height: 100%;\n\n  // @include mat.theme((\n  //   color: (\n  //     theme-type: light,\n  //     primary: mat.$azure-palette,\n  //     tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\n  //   ),\n  //   typography: Roboto,\n  //   density: 0,\n  // ));\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSame applies to other theming file locations, like in-component styles which are just \n\n```ts\n  styles: `\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n  `,\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Broken: 20.1 with styling (won't ever finish building and actually load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\n- Works: 20.1 without styling (will load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi-uz1gcmh1?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\nAdditionally, here are links from the v18 and v19 docs that can pop open a pre-existing Stackblitz with the same issue\n\n- 18: https://v18.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n- 19: https://v19.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox\n2. Open both links\n3. Observe that \"20.1 without styling\" loads\n4. Observe that \"20.1 with styling\" hangs\n5. Note the difference between both's root `styles.scss`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nApp serves and loads\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nApp hangs on \"ng serve --> Building...\" in the terminal and the `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\n### Environment\n\nThis applies to any previous version using the new theming API, so v18 and v19 as well as v20.

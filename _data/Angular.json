[es-module-loader](https://togithub.com/ModuleLoader/es-module-loader).\nIt remains as backwards-compatible as possible, while also tracking the changes of direction\nthat have been happening at the specification level.\n\nThere are a number of breaking changes and deprecations as listed below.\n\nTo upgrade, first run SystemJS 0.19 with System.config({ warnings: true }) and fix all the deprecation\nwarnings first before running SystemJS 0.20.\n\nThe corresponding release of SystemJS Builder is available at https://github.com/systemjs/builder/releases/tag/0.16.0.\n\n*For background on this release, see the blog post at http://guybedford.com/systemjs-alignment.*\n\nNew Features:\n\n-   Improved performance and reduced file size.\n-   Supports the dynamic import('./module.js') syntax in modules, when\n    transpiled with the Babel system module format with the babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import plugin enabled (alternatively this support is also provided by the SystemJS babel plugin).\n-   Supports automatically loading Web Assembly when enabled via the flag System.config({ wasm: true })\n-   New small optimized production build (5KB) for just loading System.register modules with baseURL, paths, map, contextual map, bundles, depCache and wasm support.\n-   Normalization is now fully idempotent\n-   format: 'system' is supported as an alternative to format: 'register'\n\nBreaking Changes:\n\n-   Removes the ability to use named imports from non-ES modules (eg import {readFile} from 'fs' should be import fs from 'fs'; fs.readFile). This is in order to align with the NodeJS ES module directions (https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/pull/60/files#diff-2b572743d67d8a47685ae4bcb9bec651R217).\n-   Removes support for defaultJSExtensions\n-   Default transpiler loading is removed. It is no longer possible to transpile sources without configuring one of the transpiler plugins.\n-   Setting baseURL directly is no longer supported - use System.config({ baseURL: 'x' }) over System.baseURL = x.\n-   No longer possible to set System.map\\['x'] = 'asdf'. Must use System.config({ map: { x: 'asdf' } }).\n-   Hooks no longer exist (just resolve and instantiate as in es-module-loader). Hooks via plugins still work fine.\n-   Supports IE9+ but scriptLoad support is only included in IE11+\n-   deps is no longer supported for System.register / System.registerDynamic / script load\n-   Global exports metadata as an array will no longer export the default as the first global.\n-   format: 'esm' must now be used instead of format: 'es6'\n-   A bundle with a single named System.register statement will no longer give an anonymous module value\n-   No more special handling of trailing slash in CJS\n-   System.load now does normalization, to match WhatWG spec. This method may well be deprecated as idempotent normalization should make this no longer necessary.\n-   AMD define no longer set by default when using scriptLoad, requires manually setting window.define = System.amdDefine for scriptLoad support of AMD.\n-   The separate SystemCSP and register builds are no longer available\n-   Disables a previous experimental functional return variation of System.register\n-   Alias feature is removed\n-   System and SystemJS globals are no longer defined in NodeJS\n\nBug Fixes\n\n-   depCache now uses link preloading instead of partial execution techniques which have been unreliable.\n\n### [`v0.19.47`](https://togithub.com/systemjs/systemjs/releases/0.19.47)\n\n[Compare

First with Samsung Internet browser and then happened with Chrome Mobile browser.\r\n\r\nInvestigating earlier I had read that it has to do MAYBE with how user sets the privacy of the browser so thats why service worker cant get registered.\r\n\r\nBut in this or any other case, is there a way to implement a catch on SW Registration errors so we can handle it better?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44673","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Service Worker error on Android devices\" (#44673)"},{"Id":"1098937119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-11T10:01:35","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"44684","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency hast-util-to-string to v2","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [hast-util-to-string](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify) | [`^1.0.4` -> `^2.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/hast-util-to-string/1.0.4/2.0.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/hast-util-to-string/2.0.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/hast-util-to-string/2.0.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/hast-util-to-string/2.0.0/compatibility-slim/1.0.4)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/hast-util-to-string/2.0.0/confidence-slim/1.0.4)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rehypejs/rehype-minify</summary>\n\n### [`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/releases/2.0.0)\n\n-   [`5ca4506`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/5ca4506) rehype-preset-minify: 2.0.0\n-   [`989cb98`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/989cb98) rehype-minify-whitespace: 2.0.0\n-   [`bc54363`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/bc54363) rehype-minify-url: 2.0.0\n-   [`66aff45`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/66aff45) rehype-remove-comments: 2.0.0\n-   [`52caf5f`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/52caf5f) Update for rehype@4.0.0\n-   [`f1fa138`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/f1fa138) rehype-minify-whitespace: 1.1.0\n-   [`d46e81c`](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify/commit/d46e81c) rehype-minify-whitespace: support collapsing to newline\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

On large Angular projects, like ours, Angular + webpack is very slow (1-2 minutes to start `ng serve` for example, separate issue we really need to address somehow). \r\n\r\nWhat seems to occur is that chrome (or ChromeHeadless) gives up trying to load the page (it would see the problem that the server is not responding). Karma then kills the browser and restarts it (triggering issue https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/3745). Eventually the webpack dev server starts responding, and the tests run. Once the tests complete, the coverage report (and potentially other reporters) fail to write their reports.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a bug in Karma that needs to be fixed, it does not seem to make sense to start the test framework until the webpack dev server is ready to serve the application. When it is ready, we see the `Browser application bundle generation complete` printed to the terminal.\r\n\r\nIdeally karma would be started after a 200 HTTP response could be obtained from the webpack dev server\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly thing that is required is to run `ng test` on an Angular project. The problem to reproduce is that the application has to have enough code to cause webpack dev server to be too slow to start before chrome gives up loading the page.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.2\r\nNode: 14.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.13\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                13.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.2\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\nwebpack                         5.65.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

passing websockets through IIS reverse proxy","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-server\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI need to replace a url sub-directory in my application with a new Angular app.  I want requests from /foo to be forwarded to localhost:4200.  I tried half a dozen ways to do this, and now I nearly have it working with IIS reverse proxy.  The application loads.  It thinks it's on the same domain as the rest of the application, websockets finally connect, but for some reason it refreshes many times after a saving an edit.  I can get away mostly, right now, without it, because I only need proof of concept that this scheme works to replace the sub-directory while keeping the tokens needed to make backend requests.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't priority or probably really a bug from Angular's point of view, but maybe someone has that crucial piece of knowledge that will help.\r\n\r\nHere are my IIS rules.  One thing I did find weird is how I have to Rewrite to http.  Dev Tools says it's connecting to ws, but if I set the rewrite to ws://localhost:4200/ws, I get 404'd.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.webServer>\r\n        <rewrite>\r\n            <rules>\r\n                <clear />\r\n                <rule name=\"AngularWebsockets\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"^ws$\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:4200/ws\" appendQueryString=\"false\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n                <rule name=\"Angular\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"^Angular(.*)\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                        <add input=\"{CACHE_URL}\" pattern=\"http://\" />\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:4200{R:1}\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n                <rule name=\"EazeeApp\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\r\n                    <match url=\"(.*)\" />\r\n                    <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\">\r\n                        <add input=\"{CACHE_URL}\" pattern=\"^(http?)://\" />\r\n                    </conditions>\r\n                    <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:2319/{R:1}\" logRewrittenUrl=\"true\" />\r\n                </rule>\r\n            </rules>\r\n        </rewrite>\r\n    </system.webServer>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this bug, you'll need to install ARR and Websocket support for IIS.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo error.

Now our MatToggleButtons do not work as expected. I could reproduce it in a stackblitz independent from our project.\r\n\r\nThere are two issues I see which might be also related to each other. I connected the mat-toggle-button with reactive forms to a form variable in my ts file.\r\n1. When I disable the mat-toggle-button I can still click on them and the value is actually changed which shouldn´t be possible.\r\n2. When I reenable the mat-toggle-button after clicking on the disabled buttons I can´t click them anymore in enabled state.\r\n\r\nI made a stackblitz for reproduction:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-zqthgm?file=package.json\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go the stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-zqthgm?file=package.json\r\n2. Click around on the mat-toggle-button -> everything works\r\n3. Click enable/disable button to disable the mat-toggle-group\r\n4. Click around on the disabled mat-toggle-button -> still works but it shouldn´t as they are disabled\r\n5. Click enable/disable button to enable the mat-toggle-group\r\n6. Try to click on the enabled mat-toggle-button -> doesn´t work but it should as they are enabled\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Disabled mat-toggle-buttons shouldn´t be clickable\r\n2. Enabled mat-toggle-buttons should be clickable after reenabling them\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. Disabled mat-toggle-buttons are clickable\r\n2. Enabled mat-toggle-buttons are not clickable after reenabling them\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"13.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"13.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"13.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"13.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"13.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"13.1.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"13.1.1\",\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.1.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome and Firefox tested\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24173","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatButtonToggle): MatButtonToggle breaks when disabling/enabling it\" (#24173)"},{"Id":"1095833245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-07T00:15:02","Actor":"zarend","Number":"24172","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): update active date on focus","State":"open","Body":"When a a date cell on the calendar recieves focus, set the active date\r\nto that cell.

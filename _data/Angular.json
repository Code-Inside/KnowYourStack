actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nWhen you upgrade an App locally to new version:\r\nYou have local cli with one version and global cli with another.\r\n\r\nWhen run ng command globally you will find a warning in command line about the diff version.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, i have the remove the globally cli and install the new version with the same as the local, which waste of time and hard  because sometime it is not easy to remove global deeps, which can vary on OS.\r\n\r\nAnother issue also happens it is when you also have to update the node version, which you also have again  to install the cli globally, which is waste of time.\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nDont depend on cli globally by avoid install it

This limitation becomes apparent when developers need to track and respond to specific events triggered by changes to the underlying data. It would be beneficial to have a way to register event handlers within the effect function to handle custom events and access relevant data associated with those events.\r\n\r\nThis would prevent having multiple effect() functions in our constructor if we want to perform side effects whenever our signals change.\r\n\r\n`effect(() => {\r\n          console.log(\"--> fullName is  updated -> \" + this.fullName());\r\n    });`\r\n\r\n`effect(() => {\r\n      console.log(\"--> todos updated  -> \" + this.todos());\r\n    });`\r\n\r\n`effect(() => {\r\n      console.log(\"--> Side effet contDouble -> \" + this.countDouble());\r\n    });`\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nTo address this limitation, a new feature could be introduced to enhance the effect function in Angular. This enhancement would allow developers to specify event handlers within the effect function, enabling them to react to specific events triggered by changes to the data. The event handlers would receive relevant data or event-specific parameters as arguments, providing flexibility in handling different types of events. This enhancement would empower developers to write cleaner and more concise code by encapsulating event handling logic within the effect function itself.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`effect(event => {\r\n  // Handle the data change event\r\n  console.log('Data changed:', event.value);\r\n  // ...\r\n});`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDevelopers may resort to workarounds such as manual event tracking outside of the effect function or implementing custom event handling mechanisms. However, these alternatives can introduce additional complexity, reduce code maintainability, and hinder the overall developer experience. Having a built-in event handling feature within the effect function would provide a more streamlined and standardized approach, eliminating the need for custom event handling implementations.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50300","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhancement: Event Handling in Effect Function for Angular Signals\" (#50300)"},{"Id":"1709549668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T08:17:07","Actor":"dzurrahman","Number":"50299","RawContent":null,"Title":"is signal support sharing data between child and parent ?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\nim just update my core library to angulat 16. just wanna know, is signal support sharing data between child and parent right now? cause i got message error \r\n\r\n`Type '{ title: string; showTab: boolean; }[]' is missing the following properties from type 'WritableSignal<dataTitleData[]>': set, update, mutate, asReadonly, [SIGNAL]`\r\n\r\nThanks,\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n-\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n-","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50299","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"is signal support sharing data between child and parent ?\" (#50299)"},{"Id":"1710277843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T01:20:25","Actor":"incapdns","Number":"50308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Source map not working for SCSS files","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, generate, run, serve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a /* comment */ is placed in the SCSS, the position of the content generated by webpack (sourcemap) is displayed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nIt is important to point out that after removing the comment, the desired behavior is successfully obtained.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also did a test using the following loaders in the webpack.config.js part: 'style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'.\r\nAnd even having the comment, the content was generated correctly.\r\nThat is, it is certainly not a sass-loader or dart-sass problem, it must be something external that is being used in the webpack settings that were provided by angular, or some plugin or something along those lines\r\n\r\n### The problem:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40347728/0646f79e-c648-4a28-b672-55f06ada9874)\r\n\r\n### The source code:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/40347728/1cb159d7-e321-485c-b5a1-e3fdbfb62a97)\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that I see exists, so I'm reporting on this channel, but not limited to just SCSS comments, as I write SCSS code other related issues happen, which makes it difficult to debug the application.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

ApplicationRef.isStable doesn't emit `true` after some time","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular hydration logic depends on the `ApplicationRef.isStable` on the client for a couple things:\r\n\r\n- when the post-hydration DOM cleanup should happen (to remove all unclaimed DOM segments)\r\n- when to output hydration stats into a console\r\n- when the HttpClient cache should no longer be in use\r\n\r\nWe've received a few requests where hydration stats are not displayed in a console after hydration and in all cases this leads into `ApplicationRef.isStable` not emitting `true`. There are various reasons for this and in in vast majority of cases the problems are **unrelated** to hydration. However, previously this was not \"visible\" in the app, but with hydration the use of `ApplicationRef.isStable` increased and it becomes more important to get to the \"stable\" state.\r\n\r\nAs a first step to improve the DX, we should add a warning when the app didn't get to the \"stable\" state after some time (N seconds, N=10?). For this warning it'd be also important to have an error guide page to explain this problem in more details and provide some hints on how to resolve that. We could also use this error guide page to collect more information about use-cases over time.\r\n\r\nRelevant code: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/hydration/api.ts#L162-L183.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50285","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hydration: add a warning when ApplicationRef.isStable doesn't emit `true` after some time\" (#50285)"},{"Id":"1708748893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-13T21:46:04","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50281","RawContent":null,"Title":"What is the status of internal constructors ?

Sass compiles everything into a single Sass file, the url that's used from Module B remains the same (which is relative to the original Module B location), resulting in errors around resolving file locations (because the compiled file doesn't have the same file location as the original).\r\nOriginal behavior didn't care about this, and the compiled output correctly brought linked files up and

[`v0.17.19`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01719)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.18...v0.17.19)\n\n-   Fix CSS transform bugs with nested selectors that start with a combinator ([#&#8203;3096](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3096))\n\n    This release fixes several bugs regarding transforming nested CSS into non-nested CSS for older browsers. The bugs were due to lack of test coverage for nested selectors with more than one compound selector where they all start with the same combinator. Here's what some problematic cases look like before and after these fixes:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo {\n      > &a,\n      > &b {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    .bar {\n      > &a,\n      + &b {\n        color: green;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo :is(> .fooa, > .foob) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar :is(> .bara, + .barb) {\n      color: green;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome90) */\n    .foo > :is(a.foo, b.foo) {\n      color: red;\n    }\n    .bar > a.bar,\n    .bar + b.bar {\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix bug with TypeScript parsing of instantiation expressions followed by `=` ([#&#8203;3111](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3111))\n\n    This release fixes esbuild's TypeScript-to-JavaScript conversion code in the case where a potential instantiation expression is followed immediately by a `=` token (such that the trailing `>` becomes a `>=` token). Previously esbuild considered that to still be an instantiation expression, but the official TypeScript compiler considered it to be a `>=` operator instead. This release changes esbuild's interpretation to match TypeScript. This edge case currently [appears to be problematic](https://sucrase.io/#transforms=typescript\\&compareWithTypeScript=true\\&code=x%3Cy%3E%3Da%3Cb%3Cc%3E%3E\\(\\)) for other TypeScript-to-JavaScript converters as well:\n\n    | Original code | TypeScript | esbuild 0.17.18 | esbuild 0.17.19 | Sucrase | Babel |\n    |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n    | `x<y>=a<b<c>>()` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a();` | `x<y>=a();` | `x=a()` | Invalid left-hand side in assignment expression |\n\n-   Avoid removing unrecognized directives from the directive prologue when minifying ([#&#8203;3115](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3115))\n\n    The [directive prologue](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-directive-prologues-and-the-use-strict-directive) in JavaScript is a sequence of top-level string expressions that come before your code. The only directives that JavaScript engines currently recognize are `use strict` and sometimes `use asm`. However, the people behind React have made up their own directive for their own custom dialect of JavaScript. Previously esbuild only preserved the `use strict` directive when minifying, although you could still write React JavaScript with esbuild using something like `--banner:js=\"'your directive here';\"`. With this release, you can now put arbitrary directives in the entry point and esbuild will preserve them in its minified output:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    'use wtf'; console.log(123)\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(123);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    \"use wtf\";console.log(123);\n    ```\n\n    Note that this means esbuild will no longer remove certain stray top-level strings when minifying. This behavior is an intentional change because these stray top-level strings are actually part of the directive prologue, and could potentially have semantics assigned to them (as was the case with React).\n\n-   Improved minification of binary shift operators\n\n    With this release, esbuild's minifier will now evaluate the `<<` and `>>>` operators if the resulting code would be shorter:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(10 << 10, 10 << 20, -123 >>> 5, -123 >>> 10);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10<<10,10<<20,-123>>>5,-123>>>10);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(10240,10<<20,-123>>>5,4194303);\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A TypeScript build information file will be written after each build and\r\nan attempt to load and use the file will be made during compilation setup. Caching is enabled by default within\r\nthe CLI and can be controlled via the `ng cache` command. This is the first use of persistent caching for the\r\nesbuild-based builder. If the TypeScript `incremental` option is manually set to `false`, the build system will\r\nnot alter the value. This can be used to disable the behavior, if preferred, by setting the option to `false` in\r\nthe application's configured `tsconfig` file.\r\nNOTE: The build information only contains information regarding the TypeScript compilation itself and does not\r\ncontain information about the Angular AOT compilation. TypeScript does not have knowledge of the AOT compiler\r\nand it therefore cannot include that information in its build information file. Angular AOT analysis is still\r\nperformed for each build.\r\n\r\nInitial profiling indicates this provides a ~20% improvement to warm build times for a production build of a newly generated project.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/25192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support incremental TypeScript semantic diagnostics in esbuild builder\" (#25192)"},{"Id":"1707376157","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-12T10:28:25","Actor":"wartab","Number":"25199","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular_devkit/build-angular): Allow relative paths in global scripts that don't start with \"./\" on Windows","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This was particularly useful for updating values in real-time during a drag operation. For instance, consider the following setup:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"minSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    (valueChange)=\"maxSliderValueChange($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nasync dragSliderStartMin(index: number) {\r\n  await this.loadFile(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nminSliderValueChange(value: number, index: number) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the newly released v16.0.0, this behavior appears to have changed. The `valueChange` event only emits a value when the slider dragging operation ends, as opposed to continuously during the drag.\r\n\r\nTo restore the previous behavior, one workaround I found is using `ngModel` for template-driven binding:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    [(ngModel)]=\"sliderValue\"\r\n    (ngModelChange)=\"sliderValueChange($event)\"\r\n    matSliderThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I achieved the same result by using `formControl` with reactive forms and subscribing to `valueChange`:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMin(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMin($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderStartThumb\r\n  />\r\n  <input\r\n    (dragStart)=\"dragSliderStartMax(index)\"\r\n    [formControl]=\"expectationMax($event, index)\"\r\n    matSliderEndThumb\r\n  />\r\n</mat-slider>\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.addSubscriptions();\r\n}\r\n\r\naddSubscriptions() {\r\n  this.expectationMin(this.index)\r\n    .valueChanges.pipe(distinctUntilChanged())\r\n    .subscribe((value) => {\r\n      console.log('min value changed', value);\r\n      this.minSliderValueChange(value, this.index);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  // same for expectationMax and maxSliderValueChange\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring up this change in behavior as it may impact other users who relied on the continuous value emission during slider drags in their projects. Can anyone confirm if this change was intentional or if it's a bug?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduction of the issue in Angular v16.0.0\r\n\r\nNavigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v16.0.0: [Angular 16 slider with valueChanges showing value only when drag ends](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-xdmmkz?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, notice that when you drag the slider, the value changes are only displayed when the dragging ends. This is the behavior we're discussing in this issue.\r\n\r\n2. Comparison with the behavior in Angular v15.1.0\r\n\r\nNow, navigate to the StackBlitz sample code for Angular v15.1.0: [Angular 15, same source code, slider with valueChanges showing value when dragging the slider](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-16-material-starter-fmmekv?file=package.json).\r\n\r\nIn this sample, when you drag the slider, the value changes are continuously displayed next to the slider as you're dragging. This is the previous behavior we're comparing to.\r\n\r\nBy observing the behavior in both versions of Angular with the same source code, you can clearly see the difference in valueChange event emissions during slider dragging.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 15.1.0, the `valueChange` event used with `matSliderThumb` was designed to emit values continuously as the slider was being dragged. This enabled real-time value updates during a drag operation. I expect to see this same behavior in Angular Material version 16.0.0.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn Angular Material version 16.0.0, the `valueChange` event's behavior appears to have changed. Instead of emitting values continuously during the slider dragging operation, it now only emits a value when the slider drag operation ends. This change interrupts real-time value updates and only allows for updates when the user releases the slider.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Version 113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs Ventura, Version 13.3.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27097","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`valueChange` Event in v16.0.0 No Longer Emits Values Continuously During Slider Drag\" (#27097)"},{"Id":"1709995842","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T12:26:17","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"27098","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n13.3.9\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhen using `dateFilter` on the date picker, the `selectedChange` event never emit\r\n\r\nfrom what I'm seeing in https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration, the date picker doesn't have any breaking changes, if I'm wrong please refer me to what I need to update to make it work again (and if possible please fix the reprod)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. use `mat-calendar` normally\r\n2. use `dateFilter` for it\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-syqmnz?file=src/main.ts\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event to emit\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nwhen choosing different date the `selectedChange` event does not emit\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.2 (same behavior with 14.0.6)\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27098","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): dateFilter is not working properly\" (#27098)"},{"Id":"1709532152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T09:10:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create ng add integration test using ng new","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `ng add` integration test to run `ng new` first which should make it easier to keep up with changes to the project layout.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27096","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create ng add integration test using ng new\" (#27096)"},{"Id":"1709262962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-15T03:46:54","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"27095","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(COMPONENT): SASS Theming Extension functions for button colors","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a utility API for button colors that could be used both internally and by external clients.\r\n\r\n[For example the Fab button](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/button/_fab-theme.scss) defines a `_fab-variant` mixin like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin _fab-variant($foreground, $background) {\r\n  @include mdc-fab-theme.theme((\r\n    container-color: $background,\r\n    icon-color: $foreground,\r\n  ));\r\n\r\n  --mat-mdc-fab-color: #{$foreground};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can't use this outside of Angular because its private.\r\n\r\nSomething like this can be used both within the current code base and as a client facing API for extending the Fab button colors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin fab-variant($color-class, $foreground, $background) {\r\n  &.#{ $color-class } {\r\n    @include mdc-fab-theme.theme(\r\n      (\r\n        container-color: $background,\r\n        icon-color: $foreground,\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n    background-color: var(--mdc-fab-container-color, transparent);\r\n    color: var(--mdc-fab-icon-color, inherit);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt can be called like this with color extensions for the Fab button.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .mat-mdc-fab {\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-success, $on-success, $success);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-danger, $on-danger, $danger);\r\n    @include fab-variant(mat-info, $on-info, $info);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso `_mdc-helpers` is also private.

On inspection, the class `mat-mdc-tab-header-pagination-controls-enabled` will be applied and removed from the mat-tab-header at top speed. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nthe tab headers should either be displayed with or without the scrolling  controls < and >\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nthe display is swapping between the two, making the headers unreadable.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27084","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"matieral tab header: pagination controls flickering\" (#27084)"},{"Id":"1706487534","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-11T20:15:30","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27082","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): set explicit event options","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the date range picker might log a warning, because we aren't setting some events as explicitly active.\r\n\r\nFixes #27072.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27082","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): set explicit event options\" (#27082)"},{"Id":"1706092480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-11T15:56:14","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"27079","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v16.0.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"16.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27079","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v16.0.1 release\" (#27079)"},{"Id":"1706087531","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-11T15:45:43","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"27078","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.0.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27078","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.0.1\" with changelog.\" (#27078)"},{"Id":"1706022176","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-11T15:10:05","Actor":"glutengo","Number":"27077","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/table): Borders in sticky Header","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using sticky headers with `border-collapse: collapse` and borders on the `td` elements (in our case: `border-right`), the border does not remain sticky but scrolls out of the viewport.\r\n\r\n![cdktable_sticky_header_border_AdobeExpress](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/14246032/8a29b9af-809f-47f4-a80d-aa45106cf09b)\r\n\r\nRepro: https://stackblitz.com/edit/w4lwqg?file=src/app/cdk-table-basic-example.css\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

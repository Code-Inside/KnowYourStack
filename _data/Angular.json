FormBuilder is way too polymorphic, and I'm looking forward to improving/replacing it with something that has fewer argument shapes.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this typing issue applied only when the following are all true:\r\n1. There is a FormBuilder shorthand call\r\n2. It uses the `ControlConfig` shorthand notation (e.g. `[value, validator]`)\r\n3. The value itself is an array, which goes into a `FormControl`\r\n4. The validator is not static, e.g. it's not `Validators.required` or similar, but something that returns a dynamic `ValidatorFn` depending on arguments\r\n\r\nIn particular, number 4 above was the reason the breakage slipped through my very exhaustive tests, all of which used `Validators.required`.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds the recently-narrowed `ValidatorFn` back into the list of types that are systematically excluded from the inferred value type of the form control.\r\n\r\nC’est la vie, and hoping to simplify FormBuilder someday.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49693","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): Exclude ValidatorFn from the inferred ControlConfig type\" (#49693)"},{"Id":"1652723172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-03T21:32:15","Actor":"AugustZellmer","Number":"49688","RawContent":null,"Title":"globally-scoped variables in component template","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIf I have a function that I want to call from a whole bunch of different templates, I can conceptualize it as a pipe and then call it with the syntax `{{ arg1 | myFunc }}`.

Instead, I have to include `public readonly myConst: myClass` in every component in which I want to use `{{ myConst }}` in the template.

Basically, whatever the core problem from that issue or other related issues to be documented so it's clear to consumers of the components what they should be OK to do and what they should avoid doing.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nActions are described in full in https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26662\r\n\r\nEssentially, it is:\r\n\r\n1. Use the Material Menu component\r\n2. Use content project to add some items to the Menu component\r\n3.

Follow the [Angular Universal Guide](https://angular.io/guide/universal) to enable server side rendering first. Once you have SSR working with your application, you can enable hydration by visiting your main app component or module and importing `provideClientHydration` from `@angular/platform-browser`. You'll then add that provider to your app's bootstrapping providers list.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {\r\n  bootstrapApplication,\r\n  provideClientHydration,\r\n} from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\n// ...\r\nbootstrapApplication(RootCmp, {\r\n  providers: [provideClientHydration()]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively if you are using NgModules, you would add `provideClientHydration` to your root app module's provider list.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {provideClientHydration} from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [RootCmp],\r\n  exports: [RootCmp],\r\n  bootstrap: [RootCmp],\r\n  providers: [provideClientHydration()],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can confirm hydration is enabled by opening Developer Tools in your browser and viewing the console. You should see a message that includes hydration-related stats, such as the number of components and nodes hydrated.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @jessicajaniuk @alan-agius4\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49666","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-browser): add a public API function to enable non-destructive hydration\" (#49666)"},{"Id":"1649808289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-31T18:11:06","Actor":"sumitrawat10","Number":"49661","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in Documentation","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This code breaks with the final project structure, because there the app config is in a separate file instead of an object literal.\r\n\r\nThese changes update the utilities to account for the new structure. Note the updates are meant to cover the majority of apps and there are likely some edge cases that aren't covered. Covering all cases is tricky with the current setup, because to do so correctly would require knowledge of the entire app whereas the utilities operate on a file-by-file basis. For example, now the code is able to update a config in a separate file, but it wouldn't be able to handle a config that is re-exported. For such a case to be supported, we would need access to the type checker. These edge cases will be addressed later on with a larger refactor of the schematics utilities.\r\n\r\nI've added a couple of extra utilities for inserting function calls into the `providers` array and checking if a function is called in the `providers` array.

So basically my two form fields look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   <input matInput  [max]=\"period.get('endDate')?.value\" formControlName=\"startDate\"\r\n    [matDatepicker]=\"startDatePicker\"/>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n<input matInput [min]=\"period.get('startDate')?.value\" formControlName=\"endDate\"\r\n    [matDatepicker]=\"endDatePicker\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I've found is that the valueChanges of startDate will emit whenever the endDate is changed because of the startDate max.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem obvious in the documentation that setting the mib or max will cause the value of the control to change.\r\n\r\nHere's a [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/reactive-form-validation-angular-15-swfz9e?file=src/app/app.component.html). \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1: Select a start date and see that its value is logged to the console via the valueChanges subscription on startDate. \r\n2: Now make a change to the endDate field and note that the startDate valueChanges emits again.\r\n3: Remove the [max]=\"period.get('endDate')?.value\" from the startDate input and notice that the issue goes away.\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/forms/AbstractControl#valueChanges","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26872","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(AbstractControl): Adding a max to a datepicker input will fire valueChanges\" (#26872)"},{"Id":"1650224153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-01T01:07:47","Actor":"wtygibbs","Number":"26871","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): Password visibility shows two buttons on first load","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOn first load, when typing into the password field an alternate visibility button is displayed.

Click on `Click me` button.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe menu should be displayed in the same way, under the component.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt is displayed in the left edge.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15\r\n- CDK/Material: 15","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26856","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-menu): cdkMenu is not positioned correctly if mat.core() is not added\" (#26856)"},{"Id":"1645596292","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T11:23:57","Actor":"Siddhu-K","Number":"26855","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): Forced reflow warning for each mat-form-field in dev tools.","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI have a form with multiple rows of mat-form-fields, when I get the data from the server to edit, it takes around 5 seconds to load the mat form fields (100+ form fields). \r\n\r\nI checked the peformance tab in the devtools and found that the forced reflow warning for each of the mat-form-field.\r\n\r\nthe problem doesn't exist when adding multiple <input />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  add multiple mat-form-fields\r\n2. check peformance tab, there is Recalculate style for each of the mat-form-fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\navoid recalculate style in mat-form-fields.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 164325](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62542841/228517265-8dbfc488-9182-436d-a955-f3bcecb4682f.png)\r\n\r\nrecalculate style for each of the mat-form-field\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 164700](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62542841/228518002-9423b2d7-f6ff-4b62-ac40-ccd09461cffe.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.2.4\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.18.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.4\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, material-moment-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.4\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26855","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-form-field): Forced reflow warning for each mat-form-field in dev tools.\" (#26855)"},{"Id":"1645178337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T11:06:13","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26854","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(google-maps): update to latest typings","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the Google Maps package to use the latest version of the typings.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26854","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(google-maps): update to latest typings\" (#26854)"},{"Id":"1644782602","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T11:02:48","Actor":"kvizcarra","Number":"26851","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/formfield): Add `mdc-label` class to `<label>`","State":"closed","Body":"This is added to prevent a bug with the upcoming Theming API for Form Field.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26851","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/formfield): Add `mdc-label` class to `<label>`\" (#26851)"},{"Id":"1644818963","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T11:00:57","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"26852","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/sort): Remove unnecessary ngSkipHydration attribute","State":"closed","Body":"This attribute was inadvertently added and would cause hydration errors due to being applied on a plain table and not a component.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26852","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/sort): Remove unnecessary ngSkipHydration attribute\" (#26852)"},{"Id":"1644839304","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T00:15:08","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26853","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(many): duplicate code for exposing overlays for modals","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe have duplicated code for logic for exposing overlays to modals. some browsers won't expose the accessibility node of the overlay if there is an `aria-modal` and the live element is outside of it.

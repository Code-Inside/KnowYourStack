Similarly force-refreshing the user isn't great either, especially as he/she can be in the middle of filling a form, since it takes a certain time for the SW to fetch the new app version.\r\n- Preventing the Service Worker from serving navigation requests solves the freshness issue but breaks offline & degrades the TTI.\r\n- Defining a `dataGroup` for the index file with a `maxAge` means the app shell hash isn't checked anymore, which means the app version integrity isn't guaranteed.\r\n\r\nAn intermediate solution could be to have a customizable maximum age for the app shell (index): if that max age (say a week) has been reached, the service worker would go to the network to re-fetch the shell. This effectively means that if a newer version of the app is available, all the new assets would have to be fetched for the app to load, losing the benefits of the SW background fetching. It would also break offline support for those users as well. However, frequently returning users would not experience that, and this would enforce a maximum staleness for the app.\r\n\r\nThere might be better ways to address the problem though, but the current situation of unlimited app cache duration isn't ideal.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow specifying a max age for the index page served by the Service Worker\" (#39266)"},{"Id":"721407906","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-14T12:17:37","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"39263","RawContent":null,"Title":"NGTSC - add API to return source file dependencies","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n@angular/compiler-cli\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n@clydin talked to @alxhub in the past to introduce something like `getModuleDependencies`/ `getSourcefileDepedencies` which would go along `getResourceDependencies` which was landed via angular/angular#38048.\r\n\r\nNGTSC adds dependencies between files which is currently not being handled because such dependencies are not created via import/exports statements. This relation between these files is not known to `@ngtools/webpack` and `Webpack`, which causes updated files not to be emitted when doing change.

However, this is not the case because Webpack is only aware of the one way relation that `app.module` is a dependant of `app.component` and not the two way relation.\r\n\r\nRelated and needed to resolve https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18707 and the month the dependency tree is built using the following code https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/677f6007268c534982c748faeebccb369cb4bc64/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/loader.ts#L64-L107\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nNGTSC should provide an API, that returns the dependencies of a given source file.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NGTSC - add API to return source file dependencies\" (#39263)"},{"Id":"721356842","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-14T10:57:24","Actor":"acalvo","Number":"39262","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make i18n extractor execution idempotent","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nThis feature request is for @angular/localize\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nEach time you run `ng xi18n --ivy`, the output changes, as the order of the `trans-unit`s is different from execution to execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe output could be sorted (in any way) to ensure that if the source code doesn't change, the output is always the same.

Description\r\nI'm still a newbie in Angular (although have done web programming for 20+ years), so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in my perspective.\r\n\r\nSay when I have page that have the following snippet:\r\n```\r\n<mat-input-field class=\"foo\">\r\n  <mat-label>Foo</mat-label>\r\n  <input mat-input name=\"txtFoo\" [(ngModel)]=\"currentData.foo\" />\r\n</mat-input-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then I have another field that named \"bar\" that has DatePicker. People who used Angular Material will know the whole \"Bar\" field will be pushed down a little by the button to invoke the datepacker this way, hence make these two fields look unbalanced when be put together side-by-side.\r\n\r\nSo I added the following CSS rules try to fix it:\r\n```\r\nmat-form-field.foo input { height: 3em; }\r\nmat-form-field.foo span.mat-form-field-label-wrapper { top: 0.3em; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in the rendered CSS, I saw this for the second rule:\r\n`mat-form-field.foo[_ngcontent-cgh-c299] span.mat-form-field-label-wrapper[_ngcontent-cgh-c299] { top: 0.3em; }`\r\n\r\nThis don't work as the DOM element for .mat-form-field-label-wrapper is rendered by Angular material component, and therefore carries no _ngcontent-cgh-c299 attribute, only with class \"ng-tns-c60-3\".\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIMO, adding the [_ngcontent-cgh-c299] to the first part of CSS selector should be enough for view encapsulation. There's no need to append it to each-and-every segments of CSS selector.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nChange default behaviour may break (say if the last part is just div or span, it may apply to other components inside the scope but not previously affected), so it would be helpful to see some ViewEncapsulation options be added, or some directive like ::ng-deep that will modify the parsing rule to what I described here.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39259","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Current way of view encapsulation does not look correct to me\" (#39259)"},{"Id":"720909894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-13T22:12:56","Actor":"michaelsimsoe","Number":"39258","RawContent":null,"Title":"Service not treated as singleton when .js extension is added to service","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nnil\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nnil\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI've got a service with `{provideIn: root}`.

[#&#8203;39064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39064)\n-   **core:** migrate relative link resolution with single quotes

[#&#8203;39082](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39082)\n-   **core:** use Trusted Types policy in inert DOM builder ([#&#8203;39208](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39208))

([#&#8203;39207](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39207)) ([0875fd2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/0875fd2))\n-   **core:** depend on type definitions for Trusted Types ([#&#8203;39207](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39207)) ([c4266fb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4266fb))\n-   **core:** remove ViewEncapsulation.Native ([#&#8203;38882](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38882)) ([4a1c12c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4a1c12c))\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] getSemanticDiagnostics for external templates ([#&#8203;39065](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39065)) ([63624a2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/63624a2))\n-   **language-service:** Add

**router:** add new initialNavigation options to replace legacy ([#&#8203;37480](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37480)) ([c4becca](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4becca))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** \\* The `initialNavigation` property for the options in\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` no longer supports `legacy_disabled`,\n    `legacy_enabled`, `true`, or `false` as valid values.\n    `legacy_enabled` (the old default) is instead `enabledNonBlocking`\n-   `enabled` is deprecated as a valid value for the\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` `initialNavigation` option. `enabledBlocking`\n    has been introduced to replace it\n-   **router:** preserveQueryParams has been removed, use\n    queryParamsHandling=\"preserve\" instead\n-   **router:**  If you were accessing the `RouterLink` values of `queryParams`,\n    `fragment` or `queryParamsHandling` you might need to relax the typing to also\n    accept `undefined` and `null`. ([#&#8203;39151](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39151))\n-   **core:** \\* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Use `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` instead. Existing\n    usages will be updated automatically by `ng update`.\n-   **compiler-cli:** Expressions within ICUs are now type-checked again, fixing a regression\n    in Ivy. This may cause compilation failures if errors are found in\n    expressions that appear within an ICU. Please correct these expressions\n    to resolve the type-check errors.\n\n#### 10.1.6 (2020-10-14)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** incorrectly encapsulating

Follow [the instructions for using Harnesses](https://material.angular.io/guide/using-component-harnesses)\r\n2. In the component under test, use `setInterval`, or the rxjs `interval(n)` or `timer(0, n)` observables\r\n3.

From what I can tell, [the official stance from Angular / Zone](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10127) is that you should use `fakeAsync` plus `tick`, and call `discardPeriodicTasks` to ignore the (expected) pending intervals, instead of using `waitForAsync` / `whenStable`.\r\n\r\nThis [very old StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38697656/testing-angular2-components-that-use-setinterval-or-settimeout) suggests that one should never have `setInterval` in a component or service, instead using an injected service to provide periodic actions, so it can be mocked out during testing, but I've never seen anything \"official\" from Angular to say that intervals are unsupported.\r\n\r\nIf it's not permissible to use intervals in a component, this should be documented somewhere, with suggestions of alternative design patterns to use that are compatible with Material's test utilities.  If it is permissible, `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` should be updated to include another way of determining when the owning `ComponentFixture` is \"ready\", or I guess kick this upstream to the Zone folks so they can make `whenStable` work with intervals.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20785","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(TestbedHarnessEnvironment): Impossible to use if component under test uses intervals\" (#20785)"},{"Id":"721493888","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-14T14:08:22","Actor":"thw0rted","Number":"20784","RawContent":null,"Title":"META: The \"bug report\" template Stackblitz starter should include unit tests","State":"open","Body":"I want to report an issue with unit testing features of the library (like `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`) but the template only links to one starter Stackblitz, which is not configured to run tests.

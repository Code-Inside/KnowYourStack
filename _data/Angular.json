It seems to be a problem of Angular instead of my code because the code was running fine until I added a call to a function. It's very hard to explain, so please take a look of this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"851\" alt=\"angular_error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18685720/95409522-c88fb800-08ef-11eb-884d-ab5eb03a9752.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI don't have any idea of how to reproduce this error.

An Observable Under Test - the easiest way\r\n2. Testing multiple values - using observer spies\r\n3. Faking dependencies with Observable returning methods\r\n4. Marble Tests\r\n\r\nI believe this would make the whole notion of Observable testing much easier to digest and get easy wins in both Angular and also NgRx code (like testing effects) and will help lower the entry barrier for testing Observables.  \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. If we move forward, I could create a draft of the content and work with your documentation team to include it on Angular.io.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve Observables Testing documentation\" (#39144)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"717027732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-08T05:14:41","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"19002","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update bazel packages","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@bazel/bazelisk](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) | devDependencies | minor | [`1.6.1` -> `1.7.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fbazelisk/1.6.1/1.7.1) |\n| [@bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`2.2.0` -> `2.2.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fjasmine/2.2.0/2.2.1) |\n| [@bazel/typescript](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`2.2.0` -> `2.2.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2ftypescript/2.2.0/2.2.1) |\n| [build_bazel_rules_nodejs](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | http_archive | patch | [`2.2.0` -> `2.2.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/build_bazel_rules_nodejs/2.2.0/2.2.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazelisk</summary>\n\n### [`v1.7.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/v1.7.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/compare/v1.6.1...v1.7.1)\n\nThis Bazelisk release contains the following changes:\n\n-   üî¢  Fix regression introduced in the v1.7.0 refactoring that the release version was no longer correctly injected into the binary.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;221-httpsgithubcombazelbuildrulesnodejscompare220221-2020-10-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/2.2.0...2.2.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** js_library: correctly propagate DeclarationInfos ([41f8719](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/41f8719))\n-   **examples:** prevent ibazel EOF ([96aea69](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/96aea69)), closes [#&#8203;2143](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2143)\n-   **karma:** allow custom browsers to specify args (fixes [#&#8203;595](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/595)) ([5a58030](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/5a58030))\n-   don't glob yarn or node files when using vendored_node or vendored_yarn ([f5ef64f](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f5ef64f))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add strict_visibility to npm_install / yarn_install rules ([#&#8203;2193](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2193)) ([18c6e80](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/18c6e80)), closes [#&#8203;2110](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2110)\n-   update nodejs versions ([#&#8203;2207](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/2207)) ([5478dab](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/5478dab))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

([#&#8203;32671](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/32671)) ([f4f1bcc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f4f1bcc)), closes [#&#8203;16999](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/16999)\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] hybrid visitor should not locate let keyword ([#&#8203;39061](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39061)) ([70e13dc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/70e13dc))\n-   **router:** properly assign ExtraOptions to Router in RouterTestingModule ([#&#8203;39096](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39096)) ([d8c0534](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d8c0534)), closes [#&#8203;23347](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/23347)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** support getting resource dependencies for a source file ([#&#8203;38048](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38048)) ([5dbf357](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5dbf357))\n-   **forms:** add migration for AbstractControl.parent accesses ([#&#8203;39009](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39009)) ([aeec223](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/aeec223)), closes

ivy ([#&#8203;39060](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39060)) ([904adb7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/904adb7))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **forms:** Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of `validators` and\n    `asyncValidators` arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your\n    code relies on directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety.\n-   **forms:** Type of AbstractFormControl.parent now includes null\n\n`null` is now included in the types of .parent. If you don't already have a check for this case,\nthe TypeScript compiler might compain. A v11 migration exists which adds the not-null assertion\noperator where necessary.\n\nIn an unlikely case your code was testing the parnet against undefined with sitrct equality,\nyou'll need to change this to `=== null` instead, since the parent is not explicily initialized\nwith `null` instead of being left `undefined`.\n\n#### 10.1.5 (2020-10-07)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **router:** update getRouteGuards to check if the context outlet is activated ([#&#8203;39049](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39049)) ([771f731](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/771f731)), closes [#&#8203;39030](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39030)\n-   **compiler:** Recover on malformed keyed reads and keyed writes ([#&#8203;39004](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39004)) ([f50313f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f50313f)), closes [#&#8203;38596](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38596)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Tapping outside of the list will drop the item where it was released.\r\n\r\nNote this a further investigation of issues #19466 and #17146, which I've finally been able to get a repo on stackblitz for.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/19466\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/17146\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 7.2.8, 8.2.7, 9.1.0, 10.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, 10.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, Android\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20724","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatCheckbox/MatSlideToggle/DragDrop): Components not functioning in mobile under upgraded angularjs material to angular material project\" (#20724)"},{"Id":"715135076","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-05T20:41:22","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"20723","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 10.2.4 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20723","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 10.2.4 w/ changelog\" (#20723)"},{"Id":"715107258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-05T19:35:43","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"20722","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/button): add button harness example","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20722","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material/button): add button harness example\" (#20722)"},{"Id":"714909131","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-05T14:48:31","Actor":"BuZZ-dEE","Number":"20720","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CDK - cdkDragPreview): SVG masks are not shown in the drag preview","State":"open","Body":"#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect to see the applied SVG mask in the drag preview.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe element drag preview without the applied SVG mask.\r\n\r\n#### The problem\r\n\r\nIt seems that the dragged element with SVG mask definition is set to `display:none;`, also there seems to be a clone without the mask id the in DOM.\r\nFor that reason the SVG mask is not found and not applied in the drag preview.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v10.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: v10.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CDK - cdkDragPreview): SVG masks are not shown in the drag preview\" (#20720)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-10-08T05:30:05.1483771Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2483}

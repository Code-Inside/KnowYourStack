This can lead to issues where developers are unable to detect if the service worker registration has failed or if the caching process has been successfully completed.\r\nExample, right now I am unable to detect if the service worker registration failed. After inspection I found out that the `navigator.serviceworker.register` code is present in main.js file generated after production build. The catch handler attached to the returned promise just consoles the error. \r\nAlso, there is no feedback about the caching of assets. The service worker is installed even if any asset could not be cached but some use cases might things to be handled a little differently.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe `ServiceWorker `module could provide some observables which emit such errors and feedback for registration failure, successful caching etc., \r\nAlso more control over caching should be present because for some applications which are fully offline might require that all assets be cached before the Service worker installation is deemed successful. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nTried using the observables provided by SwUpdate service but realized that they don't work for the initial registration. \r\nTried using navigator.serviceworker.ready promise but this promise never rejects and will wait indefinitely to resolve until some SW is registered.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57159","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request: Enhanced Control and Feedback for Service Worker Registration and Caching\" (#57159)"},{"Id":"2433494681","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-27T14:48:55","Actor":"e-oz","Number":"57158","RawContent":null,"Title":"TypeScript 5.6 causes NG3 error","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI know that `@angular/compiler` does not support TS 5.6 yet, just a heads-up:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/e-oz/stackblitz-starters-wchtmf?file=src/main.ts\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/e-oz/stackblitz-starters-wchtmf?file=src/main.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\"This kind of expression is always falsy.\"\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 18.2-next\r\nTypeScript 5.6.0-beta\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57158","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TypeScript 5.6 causes NG3 error\" (#57158)"},{"Id":"2433237951","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-27T09:16:40","Actor":"reuse-ay","Number":"57155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Page Not Found https://angular.jp/api/core/for","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nPage Not Found\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.jp/api/core/for\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n@for\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57155","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Page Not Found https://angular.jp/api/core/for\" (#57155)"},{"Id":"2433313546","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-27T09:15:44","Actor":"evantrimboli","Number":"57156","RawContent":null,"Title":"@if condition narrowing doesn't match typescript behaviour","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nConsider the code below.

This is particularly useful when image links are signed and returned by the backend server, rather than being generated on the frontend.\r\n\r\nExample of the predefined srcset:\r\n```\r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/128 128w,  \r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/256 256w,\r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/384 384w\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ngSrcset` does not support a complete srcset with image links, it only supports a comma-separated list of one or more width/density descriptors. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that while I can add `[attr.srcset]` for the image, NgOptimizedImage won't be able to work with it. For instance, if I have an image marked with `priority`, NgOptimizedImage will autogenerate preload link element without `imagesrcset`, basically omitting `[attr.srcset]`. It seems that it generates `imagesrcset` only when `ngSrcset` is used, which prevents the use of NgOptimizedImage with predefined srcset values.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow NgOptimizedImage to work with `[attr.srcset]` or add support for NgOptimizedImage to be able to use predefined srcset within `ngSrcset`. Along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n<img [ngSrc]=\"image.src\"\r\n     [ngSrcset]=\"image.srcset\"\r\n     [disableOptimizedSrcset]=\"true\"\r\n     sizes=\"100vw\"\r\n     priority\r\n     fill />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `image.srcset` is just a string of \r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://images.com/signature/image.png/128 128w, https://images.com/signature/image.png/256 256w, https://images.com/signature/image.png/384 384w\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nTo make it work right now, I had to come up with a custom image loader and a bunch of utility functions.\r\n\r\nWith `image.srcset` defined as\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrcset: { [key: string]: string; }; // key is image width, value is an image src\r\n```\r\nI have the following `<img>`\r\n\r\n```\r\n<img [ngSrc]=\"image.src\"\r\n     [ngSrcset]=\"getSrcSet(image.srcset)\"\r\n     [loaderParams]=\"{srcset: image.srcset}\"\r\n     [disableOptimizedSrcset]=\"true\"\r\n     sizes=\"100vw\"\r\n     priority\r\n     fill />\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function getSrcSet(srcset: { [key: string]: string }): string {\r\n  return Object.keys(srcset).map(key => key + 'w').join(', ')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this sort of custom image loader\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const predefinedSrcsetImageLoader: ImageLoader = (config: ImageLoaderConfig): string => {\r\n  if (config.loaderParams?.['srcset'] && config.width) {\r\n    let srcset: { [key: string]: string } =\r\n      config.loaderParams?.['srcset'];\r\n\r\n    return srcset[config.width];\r\n  } else {\r\n    return config.src;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this approach works, it requires additional effort and complexity that could be avoided with better support for predefined srcset values in NgOptimizedImage.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57145","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow NgOptimizedImage to work with predefined srcset\" (#57145)"},{"Id":"2432168813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T12:46:47","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"57144","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs): fix formatting and highlighting issues","State":"open","Body":"Instead of using `ts` and `html` for code formatting we now use `angular-ts` and `angular-html` which have better support for angular templates + angular inline templates. \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57144","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs): fix formatting and highlighting issues\" (#57144)"},{"Id":"2432150027","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T12:36:13","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"57143","RawContent":null,"Title":"defer block tutorial glitch","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bc390c2-a0c1-4469-82a7-df3f3e6b7815\r\n\r\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57143","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"defer block tutorial glitch\" (#57143)"},{"Id":"2432007336","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T11:11:50","Actor":"noemission","Number":"57142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Netlify","State":"closed","Body":"Changes:\r\n- Add GH workflows for deployment to Netlify\r\n- Disable SSR","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Netlify\" (#57142)"},{"Id":"2431972534","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T10:50:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"57141","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add documentation for the inject migration","State":"open","Body":"Adds a reference for the `inject()` migration to ADEV.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57141","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: add documentation for the inject migration\" (#57141)"},{"Id":"2431776791","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-26T09:23:41","Actor":"daniel-sc","Number":"57140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wrong warning about not animatable properties","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn some situations, using an non-animatable property in a transition within a non-animated \"style\" step shows a (wrong) developer warning.

The `create` method seems to register an esbuild `onLoad` handler that will [read the path as a local file](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/048df34ccb7d4ef67b5877e126c74c0db65b879c/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/stylesheet-plugin-factory.ts#L167-L170)\r\n\r\nAny URLs ending in `.less`, `.scss` or `.sass` are also affected.\r\n\r\nIn our case we can't easily remove `.css` from the imported URL, as it's defined by an imported third party CSS file.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with `ng new`\r\n2. Install Tailwind by following the [Tailwind + Angular installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular)\r\n3. Add the following to `src/styles.css`: `@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/earlyaccess/notokufiarabic.css);`\r\n4. Run `npm run build`\r\n5.

But, I'm facing some runtime issues that I'm not really able to flag as \"internal problems\" or \"angular issues\".  \r\n\r\nSo: either I'm doing something really stupid (then sorry for the waste of time) or there is a bug at angular level. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm mostly inclined to think it's an angular issue related to the usage of \"ng-modules\" / \"zone.js\" and the way esbuild is striping the bundle from unnecessary code as soon as `optimization: true` (default). \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I've created a simple angular project ([myws](https://github.com/mauriziocescon/myws/tree/master)) that you can fork and play with. It's a tiny and simplified version of what we're doing in our CI/CD. \r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the process:  \r\n- build an ng-element (with ng-modules / zone.js) as an application, \r\n- concatenate the resulting files in one main.js, \r\n- load such files at runtime. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the repo, the results are the following: \r\n- mf1 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\"`, `\"buildOptimizer\": true`,\r\n- mf2 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": false`,\r\n- mf3 (🚫): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": true`.\r\n\r\nwhere mf1 / mf2 / mf3 have basically the same code. \r\n\r\nThe runtime error for mf3 is not really helpful: \r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 22 59\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/006b6a39-ddad-41d3-ad1d-ab5ae8751e66\">\r\n\r\nLocally, I get different errors for different internal mfs, but I assume the root cause is the same. Some examples: \r\n<img width=\"686\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 27\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b049a8e2-2689-472d-a80a-2d95c2446a81\">\r\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 54\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a7771a-8ffb-4541-a3c2-78757b7e1c42\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope there's enough information to the make the ticket actionable on your side!

Clone the [angular cli repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). \r\n2. Run `yarn build --local`\r\n3. Open the dist folder and extract _angular_cli.tgz (Using this as an example you can look for any other tgz file in dist)\r\n4. Open the `package.json` file\r\n5.

This change caused sections in our application to appear more prominent than expected. Additionally, this creates inconsistency in places where we combine custom styles that set the color of outlines by using the `outline-variant` role from the theme, and also have `mat-dividers` within.\r\n\r\nI understand that the change from #28995 is to achieve better color contrast. However, this deviates from the specification, which explains that dividers are decorative elements and have no minimum contrast requirements.\r\n\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/accessibility\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/specs#f7d1605e-1629-404c-86a5-0ef6848ce520\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5161b955-a4ff-4cdc-9d09-d1b1ca807908)\r\n\r\nA potential workaround can be to use the `--mat-divider-color` property and set color to the `outline-variant` token, but it would be nice if there is no need for style changes.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz links: \r\n- Angular Material **18.1.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu?file=package.json\r\n- Angular Material **18.0.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu-iaag8z?file=package.json\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

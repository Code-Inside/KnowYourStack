See https://github.com/help-me-mom/ng-mocks/issues/7742\n\nThe problem is that `getDeferBlocks` returns an empty array when the `ViewContainerRef` is injected before calling it.\n\nHere is a unit test that reproduces the issue:\n\n```ts\nimport { Component, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  DeferBlockBehavior,\n  DeferBlockState,\n  TestBed,\n} from '@angular/core/testing';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'large-component',\n  template: `I'm so large!`,\n})\nclass LargeComponent {}\n\n@Component({\n  imports: [LargeComponent],\n  template: `\n    @defer {\n    <large-component />\n    } @placeholder { Placeholder } @loading { Loading... }\n  `,\n})\nclass DeferTestComponent {}\n\ndescribe('defer bug', () => {\n  it('should render a defer block in different states', async () => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      deferBlockBehavior: DeferBlockBehavior.Manual,\n    });\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(DeferTestComponent);\n    await fixture.whenStable();\n\n    // having this here will cause getDeferBlocks to return []\n    // doing it after getDeferBlocks has no negative side-effects\n    fixture.debugElement.injector.get(ViewContainerRef);\n\n    const deferBlocks = await fixture.getDeferBlocks();\n    const deferBlockFixture = deferBlocks[0];\n\n    // Renders placeholder state by default.\n    expect(fixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Placeholder');\n    // Render loading state and verify rendered output.\n    await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Loading);\n    expect(fixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Loading');\n\n    // Render final state and verify the output.\n    await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Complete);\n\n    expect(fixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain(\"I'm so large!\");\n  });\n});\n```\n\nI took the example from the Angular documentation and added the line to access the `ViewContainerRef`.\n\nThe unit test will fail with:\n\n```\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'render')\n```\n\nI am very interested how injecting a service is affecting the rendering process. I have tested this on Angular 18+.\n\ncheers.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nsee description\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.0.2\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.3\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.2\n@angular/build               20.0.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62047","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`fixture.getDeferBlocks()` returns empty array\" (#62047)"},{"Id":"3143518886","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-13T13:04:21","Actor":"Abreuvoir","Number":"62046","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fallback for <ng-content> does not work if projected content is inside a @if","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using [fallback on content projection](https://angular.dev/guide/components/content-projection#fallback-content), if the projected content is inside a if and its condition is false, it is still considered present and nothing appears.\n\nRepro:\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'test-projection',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    <ng-content>Fallback</ng-content>\n  `,\n})\nexport class ContentProjectComponent {}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [ContentProjectComponent],\n  template: `\n  <div>\n    condition: \n    <input type=\"checkbox\" (change)=\"condition = !condition\"> {{condition}}\n  </div>\n\n  <hr>\n  With condition:\n  <test-projection>\n    @if(condition) {\n      <div>I am projected</div>\n    }\n  </test-projection>\n\n  <hr>\n  Without condition:\n  <test-projection>\n     <!-- Nothing -->\n  </test-projection>\n\n  <hr>\n  Static:\n  <test-projection>\n  Something\n  </test-projection>\n`,\n})\nexport class Playground {\n  condition: boolean = false;\n}\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/6h4pbxhv?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nTested with Angular 19 & 20\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSomething else may be going on.

The more errors become accepted commonplace, the more we ignore them.\n\nThe funny thing is... even the Angular University article on this error, uses a async delay JUST TO HIDE the error! Obviously this is ugly hack. You could do a number of solutions to not see the error, but in the end the number of repeated change detection cycles will be the same.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow an optional flag or expectation mechanism for a expression changed error—particularly for component bootup during initial lifecycle hooks for specific variables.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of an error, make this a console.warn() during initial lifecycle hooks.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62033","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mark NG0100 Expression Has Changed errors as deliberate and either console.warn or hide the error.\" (#62033)"},{"Id":"3140611164","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-12T14:49:51","Actor":"bencodezen","Number":"62031","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update phrasing and fix code snippet","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen configuring default options for mat-components in `ApplicationConfig`, the entire component is being included in the initial bundle rather than being lazy-loaded along with the components that use them.\n\nObviously, you could load the config at every component, but that would be quite annoying.\n\n```typescript\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners(),\n    provideZonelessChangeDetection(),\n    provideRouter(routes),\n    /*{\n      provide: MAT_FORM_FIELD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n      useValue: {\n        subscriptSizing: \"dynamic\",\n        appearance: \"outline\",\n        floatLabel: \"always\",\n      } as MatFormFieldDefaultOptions,\n    },*/\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nExample with the app in the Stackblitz with the options commented:\n```\nInitial chunk files | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-UP2ZEWFZ.js   | -              | 136.87 kB |                40.26 kB\nmain-GUD7ZPGJ.js    | main           |  78.08 kB |                19.85 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css | styles         |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                    | Initial total  | 214.96 kB |                60.12 kB\n\nLazy chunk files    | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-5PV7XSBR.js   | test-component |  59.39 kB |                10.30 kB\n```\n\nWithout the comment:\n```\nInitial chunk files | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-NOK43ORO.js   | -              | 195.29 kB |                49.77 kB\nmain-EVKXTY5S.js    | main           |  78.18 kB |                19.88 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css | styles         |   0

size\nchunk-IGEEQONQ.js   | test-component | 304 bytes |               304 bytes\n```\n\nIf you happen to configure snack-bar, form-field, and dialog, you already reach a bundle size of 405kB, which is just shy of the 500kB warning for initial bundle size. If you add anything remotely big like a CSS theme, you're easily over that limit. Note that if you add a pre-built Material theme, it adds an extra 7kB.\n\nI'm not sure about the internals of the library, but it seems rather odd. I feel like the injection tokens shouldn't cause the rest of the features to be loaded.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ldgbpznx-ia2hbzsb?file=src%2Ftest.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLoad the actual components lazily.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe components are in the initial bundle.\n\n### Environment\n```\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.2\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.3\n... cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms, material\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.2\n@angular/build               20.0.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Configuring default options for different mat components results in the entire component being in the initial bundle\" (#31342)"},{"Id":"3139199565","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-12T07:38:25","Actor":"dinesh250-star","Number":"31341","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(BUTTON): mat-button changed to matButton in angular material 20","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn angular 20, mat-button has been changed to matButton.

This results in the web worker failing with a `JIT compiler unavailable` error when running the compiled `dist` folder using `http-server` for example (the error does not occur when using `ng serve`).\n\nThe error vanishes when:\n- the function used in the web worker is imported directly from the function file instead of using the barrel file; or\n- the service does not inject the `HttpClient`.\n\nI think the main problem here is that no tree-shaking is happening to the web worker?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/tijsmoree/webworker-jit-error\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: JIT compiler unavailable\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 20.16.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.14.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... platform-browser\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@angular/build               19.0.2\n@angular/cli                 19.0.2\n@schematics/angular          19.0.2 (cli-only)\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.6.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58952","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Web worker + barrel files can give JIT errors\" (#58952)"},{"Id":"2701604433","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T10:10:59","Actor":"alvaro-junqueira-axa","Number":"58951","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: indenting internal code for easier understanding","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

'On' : 'Off' }}</button>\n```\n\nAnd the easiest way is to use the [select clause ICU expression](https://angular.dev/guide/i18n/prepare#mark-alternates-and-nested-expressions) like this:\n\n```\n<button i18n>{ active, select, true { On } false { Off } }</button>\n```\n\nbut the documentation says:\n> The select clause marks choices for alternate text based on your defined <ins>**string values**</ins>.\n\nIn my case, `active` property is a boolean and I'm using true/false like it's a boolean selection_category but it is actually interpreted as text. \n\nIs this usage officially supported or is this a strange/hacky case that just happens to work because of boolean to string conversion?\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEither:\n1. Explicitly say in the documentation that using the select ICU expression with a boolean property is supported and provide an example.\n   - In that case, could the select clause be compile checked to make sure true and false categories, and only true and false, are specified?\n3. Create a specific boolean ICU expression, for example: `{ active, bool, true { On } false { Off } } `\n4. Add support for `$localize` and back quotes (`` ` ``) in template to be able to do: ``<button>{{ active ? $localize`On` : $localize`Off` }}</button>``\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can define a method in the component and use it like that:\n```\nexport class ExampleComponent {\n   active: boolean;\n   getActiveText(): string {\n      return active ? $localize`On` : $localize`Off`\n   }\n}\n```\n```\n<button>{{ getActiveText() }}</button>\n```\n\nBut it will tend to complicate your component script with a lot of meaningless methods, and I feel that this use case could be simplified.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58943","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support i18n boolean expression in template\" (#58943)"},{"Id":"2699704217","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T20:20:02","Actor":"DmitryEfimenko","Number":"58941","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev experience when passing around ResourceOptions is suboptimal","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWriting APIs that accept `ResourceOptions` as an argument is suboptimal. Not sure if there could anything be done about it or if it's just a limitation of TypeScript. See example below:\n\nWhen using the following signature, all types are figured out correctly:\n```ts\nconst resourceRef = resource({\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n})\n```\nThe type of `id` in the loader's request argument is correctly inferred as `number`. The type of `resourceRef` is `ResourceRef<string>`.\nNotice how I didn't have to specify any types explicitly. Everything just works.\n\nHowever, if options are declared separately, things fall apart:\n\n```ts\nconst resourceOptions = {\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n} satisfies ResourceOptions<any, any>;\n\nconst resourceRef = resource(resourceOptions);\n```\n\nWith this, the type of resourceRef is correct: `ResourceRef<string>`. However, the type of `id` in loader's request argument is `any`.\n\nAlso, this might have something to do with the comment about an issue with `NoInfer`: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58871#issuecomment-2498195267\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMaking generic types optional by  providing default `any` value makes it slightly easier to work with, but overall does not provide the dev experience I'm after.\n\n```ts\nexport interface ResourceOptions<T = any, R = any> {\n  request?: () => R;\n  loader: ResourceLoader<T, R>;\n  equal?: ValueEqualityFn<T>;\n  injector?: Injector;\n}\n```\n\nNeed guidance from someone more experienced with TypeScript.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCreate a function that takes options and returns them. This seems silly since it seemingly just adds boilerplate, but it works:\n\n```ts\nfunction createResourceOptions<T, R>(options: ResourceOptions<T, R>): ResourceOptions<T, R> {\n  return options;\n}\n\nconst resourceOptions = createResourceOptions({\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n});\n\nconst resourceRef = resource(resourceOptions);\n```\nAll types are figured out correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dev experience when passing around ResourceOptions is suboptimal\" (#58941)"},{"Id":"2699128862","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:48:42","Actor":"anthony-b-dev","Number":"58936","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgComponentOutlet documentation is broken","State":"closed","Body":"At the end of the usage section, the complex example is cut off. \n\n[angular.dev](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgComponentOutlet?tab=usage-notes)\n\nThis line seems to be broken. \n\n`{@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='CompleteExample'}`\n\n[ng_component_outlet.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/30891d8dec1060c4471563346deb60be4946c807/packages/common/src/directives/ng_component_outlet.ts#L89)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58936","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NgComponentOutlet documentation is broken\" (#58936)"},{"Id":"2699458792","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:42:35","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"58940","RawContent":null,"Title":"Check if a required input is provided using `withComponentInputBinding`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using `withComponentInputBinding` in ApplicationConfig, I can pass:\n \n- query parameters\n- path and matrix parameters\n- static route data\n- data from resolvers \n\nto component via inputs.

It employs [the new Worker interface](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/blob/main/packages/dicomImageLoader/src/init.ts#L7-L11):\n\n```js\nconst instance = new Worker(\n    new URL('./decodeImageFrameWorker.js', import.meta.url),\n    { type: 'module' }\n);\n```\n\nWe have successfully consumed the lib in various scenarios, whether based on Webpack or Vite. See the examples below:\n-  https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vite-react-cornerstone3d\n-  https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vue-cornerstone3d\n-  https://github.com/cornerstonejs/nextjs-cornerstone3d\n\nWhen integrating into a Vite-based framework, a warning appears regarding one of the dependencies. [This is a known issue in Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8427), specifically with esbuild. To resolve this, we should add the library to `optimizeDeps` in the Vite config - recommended by vite maintainers, which works well.\n\nI attempted to [integrate a poc of the same library](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/angular-cornerstone3d) in Angular and encountered a similar warning. I tried customizing Vite but faced a limitation, as there is no way to override `optimizeDeps` in Angular, as noted [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26859).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b101e1de-a645-4248-9e89-196cd3a04aa7)\nIn some threads, I see that setting \n\n```\n\"cli\": {\n    \"cache\": {\n      \"enabled\": false\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nremoves the warning above, but then the worker is requested from an incorrect path.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22786cdf-ae02-4c19-9a6a-c0fed89da210)\n\nI also have tried the following \n\n```js\n\"development\": {\n        \"buildTarget\": \"angular-vite-6:build:development\",\n        \"prebundle\": false\n}\n```\n\nstill no success\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThis is basically minimal repo for reproduction \n- https://github.com/cornerstonejs/angular-cornerstone3d\n\n\ncommands to run \n\n```\nnpm i \n\nnpm run start\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nWith the cache enabled, the Vite warning appears, and disabling the cache loads the worker from the wrong path.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 18.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.2\n@schematics/angular             19.0.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI want to emphasize that other Vite-based implementations for [Vue](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vue-cornerstone3d), [React](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vite-react-cornerstone3d), and [Quasar](https://github.com/sedghi/quasar-cornerstone3D) work, so it's only Angular that's not working.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebWorkers problem in Angular related to Vite `optimizeDeps`\" (#28994)"},{"Id":"2702601899","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T15:49:09","Actor":"bertrand-ravier","Number":"28993","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSR isMainModule function return false when node app server is launched by Phusion Passenger","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nother\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.0.4\n\n### Description\n\nHi,\n\nMy application is served on a Plesk server, which first launch Phusion Passenger before executing the node application. With Angular v 18.0.4, all worked fine.\n\nI updated to Angular 19.0.x. Everything works fine in local environment. But when deployed, I can access to the root page (probably served by Nginx or Apache) and I can navigate to other pages in client side. But I get a timeout when requesting another page from server side. The node application is not listening for incoming requests.\n\nThe problem comes from the `isMainModule(url)` function, that test the first argument on the command line. I do not launch myself the node server, it is launch with Phusion Passenger. Perhaps it adds some other arguments to the command line.\n\nI bypassed the test `argv[1] === fileURLToPath(url)` with a local variable `process.env['RUN']` set in dev and production environnements. It allow to build without error (because I do not pass this variable when building) and when executing the server it now listen for requests.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular v19 project, with SSR, and a route to a component (/ssr for example).\nDeploy to a server with Phusion Passenger configurated to launch a node application.\nGo to the route /ssr and wait for the timeout to occur.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.2\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.2\n@schematics/angular             19.0.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28993","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR isMainModule function return false when node app server is launched by Phusion Passenger\" (#28993)"},{"Id":"2702527012","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T15:34:14","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28992","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 5.7","State":"open","Body":"Updates the repo to use TypeScript 5.7.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28992","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update to TypeScript 5.7\" (#28992)"},{"Id":"2695010515","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T13:31:29","Actor":"wkaskie","Number":"28977","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): allow for custom sha hash algos in SRI","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ x ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ x ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ x ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ x ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

But since all my thousands tests passed before, now I get dozens of random errors across my apps but the common point seems to be the use of `jasmine.clock()` at some key points. I get multiple times this cryptic error : \n\n`Error: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions. Is the clock already installed?`\n\nSince I never got this error before setting `builderMode` to `application` I don't see what I'm doing wrong.\n\nSo I started a fresh project (just a plain `ng new` hello world app) and just tried to install a clock on the existing unit test. Nothing more. An boom, I got the error I mentionned earlier.\nSorry I can't provide you much more informations as I just don't understand what's going on but I hope someone will find a way to solve this problem which seems to be the source of all my trouble in unit tests with esbuild.\n\nThank you for your efforts :)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions.

With CommonEngine it was possible to set the baseHref in angular.json to '/' to achieve this.\n\n```json\n      \"i18n\": {\n        \"sourceLocale\": {\n          \"code\": \"en\",\n          \"baseHref\": \"/\"\n        },\n        \"locales\": {\n          \"de\": \"src/messages/messages.de.xlf\",\n          \"es\": \"src/messages/messages.es.xlf\"\n        }\n      }\n```\n\nNow I have migrated this application to Angular 19 and noticed that this does not seem to be possible anymore with AngularNodeAppEngine as the default locale 'en' is not recognized. The build is successful and all other locales work fine, except 'en'. Even the root path works, because the potentialLocale is '' (empty string) in this case, but no child routes can be found (at least not with ssr). Is this behavior expected? If so, are there still any workarounds to disable the locale prefix for a specific locale?\n\nIn a (maybe) naive approach, I tried adding the following line just before returning the entryPointExport in [app-engine.ts#L146](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blame/7b0aa3dec56298bb364516ac189aa32accc7dcc2/packages/angular/ssr/src/app-engine.ts#L146) and it worked, so it seems to be supported everywhere except in this particular location and therefore I really hope it's just a bug and I don't have to revert the migration.\n```javascript\nif (!entryPoints.has(potentialLocale) && entryPoints.has(\"\")) {\n    return this.getEntryPointExports(\"\");\n}\n```\n\nAny help is appreciated, because everything else is already migrated.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRepo: https://github.com/eufri/angular-ssr-issue\n\nBasically I have created a new app\n`ng new angular-ssr-issue --ssr --minimal --package-manager=yarn --routing --server-routing --skip-tests --ssr`\n\nAdded localize package\n`ng add @angular/localize`\n\nAnd then added some test locales + messages and a child component +route\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.1\n@angular/cli                    19.0.1\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.1\n@schematics/angular             19.0.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28967","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Set locale baseHref to '/' is not working with AngularNodeAppEngine\" (#28967)"},{"Id":"2692373245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:54:18","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28966","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28966","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release\" (#28966)"},{"Id":"2692286139","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:49:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28964","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28964","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.\" (#28964)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2703087084","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T19:25:42","Actor":"therlaup","Number":"30102","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-slider): Slider thumb cannot be moved by dragging the track on iOS","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n15.2.9\n\n### Description\n\nThe behavior of mat-slider components differs on iOS compared to other devices. On iOS, the thumb position is not updated when the finger touches down on the screen (i.e. \"touchstart\" event) if the track is touched. To move the thumb, a drag must start on the thumb itself. This makes it hard for users to drag the slider since they need to very precisely touch the thumb. However, if a pointer drag event starts on slider track (from a mouse or touchpad), then the thumb moves appropriately (i.e. mousedown or pointerdown event).\n\nWe've had several complains from our users on this topic and this is becoming a major issue for us. The sliders worked perfectly in version 15.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nA specific StackBlitz is not necessary as the behavor can be reproduced from https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Safari or Chrome on iOS and go to: https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n2. Using finger on touchscreen, drag the track of any of the sliders. The thumb does not move despite the ripple effect being triggered.\n3. Use a mouse or a touchpad to drag the track of any slider. The thumb moves with the drag.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe thumb position should update on touchstart event on the track. If you use v15.2.9 of the Angular material components (https://v15.material.angular.io/components/slider/overview), the dragging behavior works perfectly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iOS, the thumb position is not updated on touchstart event if the track is touched.

This makes it impossible to implement complex drag start conditions, such as only allowing drags from specific elements or under certain event conditions.\nAdd a new input [cdkDragStartPredicate] to the CdkDrag directive that accepts a predicate function to determine whether a drag operation should start.\n### Proposed API\n```typescript\n@Input('cdkDragStartPredicate')\ndragStartPredicate: ((event: TouchEvent | MouseEvent) => boolean) | undefined;\n```\n### Example Usage\n_HTML:_\n```html\n<div cdkDrag [cdkDragStartPredicate]=\"myDragStartPredicate\">\n  Draggable content\n  <input #input>\n</div>\n```\n_component:_\n```typescript\nmyDragStartPredicate(event: TouchEvent | MouseEvent): boolean {\n  const element = event.target as HTMLElement;\n  // Check if the target or any of its parents is an input element\n  return !element.closest('input, textarea, [contenteditable=\"true\"]');\n}\n```\nSee: https://stackblitz.com/edit/wc3rt4?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-drag-drop-sorting-example.css\n\n# Details\n### Benefits\n- More granular control over drag initialization\n- Better integration with custom UI patterns\n- Improved accessibility by allowing precise control over drag triggers\n- Reduced need for workarounds using multiple directives\n- \n### Implementation Notes\n- The predicate should be called before the drag sequence begins\n- Return true to allow the drag to start, false to prevent it\n- Should work with both mouse and touch events\n- Should integrate well with existing cdkDragHandle functionality\n- \n### Related Issues\nThis would also resolve this issue: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/14117\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Prevent drags from starting on specific child elements\n- Implement custom handle logic without using cdkDragHandle\n- Add conditional drag start behavior based on application state\n- Implement complex touch gesture requirements\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(drag-drop): New Optional Input [cdkDragStartPredicate]\" (#30101)"},{"Id":"2701632032","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T10:21:14","Actor":"mstawick","Number":"30100","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(FixedSizeVirtualScrollStrategy): Not all items rendered on source list change","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18\n\n### Description\n\nWhen a list of rendered items changes (new list, ie. new reference) and the length difference isn't big, only the amount of items from the previous list are rendered.

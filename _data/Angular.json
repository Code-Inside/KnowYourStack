Such a feature would also support OnPush as the implicit change detection strategy (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65485).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should add a new `strictChangeDetection` boolean option to `TypeCheckingOptions` interface to allow users to opt-in to new validation logic. If strictChangeDetection is true, any component using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush cannot render a child component with ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default. If strictChangeDetection is false or not provided, no change detection strategy validation will be performed.\n\nWhen the validation is performed, an `ngtsc` error should be shown to the user during compilation and also integrate with the Angular Language Service to show the error during development.\n\nThe solution should support validation from source code `@Component` decorator metadata and also partially compiled libraries via the generated typescript definition files.\n\nFor example, we should modify `ɵɵComponentDeclaration` to include ChangeDetectionStrategy type information.\n\n```\ntype ɵɵComponentDeclaration<T, Selector extends String, ExportAs extends string[], InputMap extends {\n    [key: string]: string | {\n        alias: string | null;\n        required: boolean;\n    };\n}, OutputMap extends {\n    [key: string]: string;\n}, QueryFields extends string[], NgContentSelectors extends string[], IsStandalone extends boolean = false, HostDirectives = never, IsSignal extends boolean = false, changeDetection extends ChangeDetectionStrategy = ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default> = unknown;\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis validation could also be performed at runtime with a warning that can be shown to the user in development mode.\n\nIf a component using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush renders a component with ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default the angular runtime should print a warning message to the screen on initial render during development mode. It should do this for each case where a Default component is rendered by an OnPush component and the message should list the name of the OnPush component and the Default component being rendered.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66303","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Validate ChangeDetectionStrategory for child components rendered by a component with ChangeDetectionStrategory.OnPush\" (#66303)"},{"Id":"3778295309","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:25:23","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"66302","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Fixes the visibility of the copy link button in CLI…","State":"open","Body":"… headings\r\n\r\nFixes the visibility of the copy link button in CLI documentation headings.\r\n \r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n https://angular.dev/cli/add#arguments\r\n\r\n<img width=\"318\" height=\"263\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ba952d9-33ac-4828-a0a2-d6f8b9c260c1\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n \r\n<img width=\"242\" height=\"230\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf21a80d-5ada-4cb3-853e-a6c3fae7638c\" />\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66302","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): Fixes the visibility of the copy link button in CLI…\" (#66302)"},{"Id":"3778181903","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-03T15:50:51","Actor":"loganmzz","Number":"66301","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(router): Fix reference to parent from children resolvers","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The options are:\r\n- 'always': Enforces a trailing slash on all URLs.\r\n- 'never': Removes trailing slashes from all URLs (default).\r\n- 'preserve': Respects the presence or absence of a trailing slash as defined in the UrlTree.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit updates the `defaultUrlMatcher` to optionally consume a single trailing empty path segment if the route otherwise matches. This ensures that routes with `pathMatch: 'full'` can correctly match URLs with trailing slashes (e.g., `/a/` matching `{path: 'a', pathMatch: 'full'}`), resolving a long-standing inconsistency where such routes would fail despite `pathMatch: 'prefix'` variants (with empty children) succeeding.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered & Design Rationale:**\r\n\r\n*  **`UrlTree.hasTrailingSlash` Property:** We initially explored adding a explicit boolean property to `UrlTree`. However, this would have required a significant public API change and breaking updates to custom `UrlSerializer` implementations to ensure the state was preserved. It also complicated the mental model of the `UrlTree` as a direct representation of the URL structure. We settled on representing trailing slashes as a trailing empty `UrlSegment`, which leverages the existing structure and serialization logic without API expansion.\r\n\r\n    **Why we chose the current approach:**\r\n    We decided on a \"Permissive Matcher, Strict Serializer/Location\" pattern.\r\n    -   The **Matcher** is permissive: it allows consuming a trailing empty segment if it's the *only* thing left, treating it effectively as optional for `pathMatch: 'full'`. This aligns logic with how `pathMatch: 'prefix'` matches empty children.\r\n    -   The **Serializer/Location** are strict: The `trailingSlash` configuration is verified at the boundaries (serialization and location normalization). If `trailingSlash: 'never'` is set, the slash is stripped *before* matching ever occurs. If matching sees a slash, it implies the configuration allowed it (or we are in a permissive mode), so the matcher should handle it gracefully.\r\n\r\nfixes #16051\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66276","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): add trailingSlash config option\" (#66276)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3778145444","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-03T15:09:13","Actor":"Christian24","Number":"32218","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow to pass --update to vitest","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Description\n\nVitest has an update command, that updates the visual regression screenshots and the snapshots.

Here we chose to start using Vite as well. However, we have been running into some issues regarding the HMR websocket connection that is being setup by Vite to notify about changes and such. We are using a custom name `portal.domain.dev` for local development. Running Angular 20 in a docker container (like we have done for years) with the following docker command: \n\n`node /opt/project/node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve --port 4201 --host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-hosts=all --ssl --ssl-cert /etc/ssl/certs/domain.dev_public_chain.pem --ssl-key=/etc/ssl/certs/domain.dev.key`\n\nWe have configured this `portal.domain.dev` in our hosts file on our machines. We then open the page using `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` and see the following in the browser console: \n\n```\nAngular is running in development mode.\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\nclient:755 WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:755\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:759Understand this error\nclient:765 [vite] failed to connect to websocket.\nyour current setup:\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[HTTP]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\n  (browser) portal.domain.dev:4201/ <--[WebSocket (failing)]--> localhost:4201/ (server)\nCheck out your Vite / network configuration and https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr .\n```\n\nWe also noticed that when we go to `https://localhost:4201/` and accept the certificate issue there, going back to `https://portal.domain.dev:4201/` would allow the websocket connection using its fallback attempted connection on localhost. See the following from the browser console:\n\n```\nclient:745 WebSocket connection to 'wss://portal.domain.dev:4201/?token=sfUythYHSwtQ' failed: \ncreateConnection @ client:745\nconnect @ client:411\nconnect @ client:751\nconnect @ client:289\nconnect @ client:373\n(anonymous) @ client:823Understand this error\ndebug_node.mjs:18311 Angular is running in development mode.\nclient:760 [vite] Direct websocket connection fallback. Check out https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-hmr to remove the previous connection error.\n```\n\nWe also have one other project we are updating to Angular 20 where we use `localhost` instead of `portal.domain.dev`. This issue is not present there.\n\nWe have spent quite a bit of time to try and fix this. But we traced this back to the HMR host configuration, which to our knowledge is not configurable through the CLI and is fully encapsulated, preventing us from exerting influence on this part of Vite. To bypass this we have developed a patch which fixed this issue and allows us to configure `server.hmr.host`. We are considering using this patch because this does fix our issue when we configure it to be `portal.domain.dev`. You will find the patch below: \n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\nindex 271dc0c..fd35e0f 100755\n--- a/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite-server.js\n@@ -714,6 +714,10 @@ async function setupServer(serverOptions, outputFiles, assets, preserveSymlinks,\n                 cert: await (0, promises_1.readFile)(serverOptions.sslCert),\n                 key: await (0, promises_1.readFile)(serverOptions.sslKey),\n             };\n+\n+            configuration.server.hmr = {\n+                host: process.env.VITE_HMR_HOST || 'portal.domain.dev',\n+            };\n         }\n         else {\n             const { default: basicSslPlugin } = await Promise.resolve().then(() => __importStar(require('@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl')));\n```\n\nWe would like Angular to expose some way to configure the `server.hmr.host`, either via a CLI flag or through the `angular.json`. \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n_Please see the description._\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.3.13\nNode: 22.21.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.4\nOS: linux arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.15\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.13\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.13\n@angular/build               20.3.13\n@angular/cli                 20.3.13\n@angular/google-maps         20.2.14\n@schematics/angular          20.3.13\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/32204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite HMR websocket connection fails\" (#32204)"},{"Id":"3756060604","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T15:08:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32192","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance (21.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n<!--renovate-debug:eyJjcmVhdGVkSW5WZXIiOiI0Mi41OC4xIiwidXBkYXRlZEluVmVyIjoiNDIuNTguMSIsInRhcmdldEJyYW5jaCI6IjIxLjAueCIsImxhYmVscyI6WyJhY3Rpb246IG1lcmdlIiwiYXJlYTogYnVpbGQgJiBjaSIsInRhcmdldDogYXV0b21hdGlvbiJdfQ==-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/32192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance (21.0.x)\" (#32192)"},{"Id":"3767634105","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T15:05:38","Actor":"clydin","Number":"32203","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): export compiler plugin and stylesheet options types","State":"open","Body":"Exposes `CompilerPluginOptions` and `BundleStylesheetOptions` via the private API.

This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable\n\n  This includes support for workspace monorepos - all `node_modules` directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Throw an error if the value of the `tokenHelper` or `<url>:tokenHelper` setting contains an environment variable.\n- Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` settings [#&#8203;10376](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10376).\n- Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories [#&#8203;10384](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10384)\n- Fixed a bug ([#&#8203;9759](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9759)) where `pnpm add` would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to its exact version.\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.2): pnpm 10.26.2\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.26.1...v10.26.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Improve error message when a package version exists but does not meet the `minimumReleaseAge` constraint. The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#&#8203;10334](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3.

The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#&#8203;10334](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n -

[`v0.27.2`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0272)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.27.1...v0.27.2)\n\n- Allow import path specifiers starting with `#/` ([#&#8203;4361](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4361))\n\n  Previously the specification for `package.json` disallowed import path specifiers starting with `#/`, but this restriction [has recently been relaxed](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/60864) and support for it is being added across the JavaScript ecosystem. One use case is using it for a wildcard pattern such as mapping `#/*` to `./src/*` (previously you had to use another character such as `#_*` instead, which was more confusing). There is some more context in [nodejs/node#49182](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49182).\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;hybrist](https://redirect.github.com/hybrist).\n\n- Automatically add the `-webkit-mask` prefix ([#&#8203;4357](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4357), [#&#8203;4358](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4358))\n\n  This release automatically adds the `-webkit-` vendor prefix for the [`mask`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/mask) CSS shorthand property:\n\n  ```css\n  /* Original code */\n  main {\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat\n  }\n\n  /* Old output (with --target=chrome110) */\n  main {\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n  }\n\n  /* New output (with --target=chrome110) */\n  main {\n    -webkit-mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n    mask: url(x.png) center/5rem no-repeat;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;BPJEnnova](https://redirect.github.com/BPJEnnova).\n\n- Additional minification of `switch` statements ([#&#8203;4176](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4176), [#&#8203;4359](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4359))\n\n  This release contains additional minification patterns for reducing `switch` statements. Here is an example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  switch (x) {\n    case 0:\n      foo()\n      break\n    case 1:\n    default:\n      bar()\n  }\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  switch(x){case 0:foo();break;case 1:default:bar()}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  x===0?foo():bar();\n  ```\n\n- Forbid `using` declarations inside `switch` clauses ([#&#8203;4323](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4323))\n\n  This is a rare change to remove something that was previously possible. The [Explicit Resource Management](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) proposal introduced `using` declarations. These were previously allowed inside `case` and `default` clauses in `switch` statements. This had well-defined semantics and was already widely implemented (by V8, SpiderMonkey, TypeScript, esbuild, and others). However, it was considered to be too confusing because of how scope works in switch statements, so it has been removed from the specification. This edge case will now be a syntax error. See [tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management#215](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management/issues/215) and [rbuckton/ecma262#14](https://redirect.github.com/rbuckton/ecma262/pull/14) for details.\n\n  Here is an example of code that is no longer allowed:\n\n  ```js\n  switch (mode) {\n    case 'read':\n      using readLock = db.read()\n      return readAll(readLock)\n\n    case 'write':\n      using writeLock = db.write()\n      return writeAll(writeLock)\n  }\n  ```\n\n  That code will now have to be modified to look like this instead (note the additional `{` and `}` block statements around each case body):\n\n  ```js\n  switch (mode) {\n    case 'read': {\n      using readLock = db.read()\n      return readAll(readLock)\n    }\n    case 'write': {\n      using writeLock = db.write()\n      return writeAll(writeLock)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This is not being released in one of esbuild's breaking change releases since this feature hasn't been finalized yet, and esbuild always tracks the current state of the specification (so esbuild's previous behavior was arguably incorrect).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jsdom/jsdom (jsdom)</summary>\n\n### [`v27.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#2740)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/compare/27.3.0...27.4.0)\n\n- Added `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`.\n- Improved decoding of HTML bytes by using the new [`@exodus/bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;exodus/bytes) package; it is now much more correct.

fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom","State":"open","Body":"## Fix scrollbar appearing with decimal line-height values in textarea autosize\r\nFixes [#32178](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32178)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen using a `<textarea>` with `cdkTextareaAutosize` and a decimal `line-height` value (e.g., `1.15`), a vertical scrollbar appears even when the content fits within the view. This issue occurs at certain browser zoom levels (e.g., 110%) where fractional pixel values get truncated by the browser.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is in the `_measureScrollHeight()` method, which subtracts `4` from the measured `scrollHeight` to account for the 2px top and bottom padding added by the measuring class. However, when the browser truncates fractional pixels (e.g., `20.4px` becomes `20px`), subtracting `4` can result in a height that's slightly less than what's actually needed, causing a scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChanged the subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()`. This provides a small margin that accounts for fractional pixel truncation, preventing scrollbars from appearing when using decimal line-height values.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.ts`**: Changed subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()` method\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.spec.ts`**: Added test `'should not show scrollbar with decimal line-height values at 110% zoom'` that verifies the fix and would fail if the value was `4`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added a unit test that simulates the fractional pixel truncation scenario\r\n- Test verifies that no scrollbar appears when using decimal line-height values\r\n- Test would fail if the subtraction value was `4`, ensuring the fix is properly validated\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- **Breaking changes**: None\r\n- **Behavior change**: Textareas with decimal line-height values will no longer show unnecessary scrollbars\r\n- **Browser compatibility**: Fixes the issue in Chrome and Edge (and potentially other browsers) at certain zoom levels","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/autosize): fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom\" (#32611)"},{"Id":"3777846336","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-03T08:21:31","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32610","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/select): global option not disabling popover","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that disabling popovers globally wasn't doing so for `mat-select`.\r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32592#issuecomment-3705666297.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32610","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/select): global option not disabling popover\" (#32610)"},{"Id":"3774439243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-02T13:32:21","Actor":"g-cheishvili","Number":"32609","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/accordion): make `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` members protected for extensibility","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request refactors the `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` classes to improve extensibility and internal access for derived classes.

`preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen building an Angular **library** (using partial compilation mode / ng-packagr), binding to the `preserveContent` input on `AccordionPanel` causes the following error:\n\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe `AccordionPanel` directive uses `hostDirectives` to expose `DeferredContentAware`:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 53)\nstatic ɵdir: ɵɵDirectiveDeclaration<AccordionPanel, \"[ngAccordionPanel]\", ...,\n  [{ directive: typeof DeferredContentAware; inputs: { \"preserveContent\": \"preserveContent\"; }; outputs: {}; }]>;\n```\n\nThe `preserveContent` input **IS exposed** via the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping, making it appear as a valid input on `AccordionPanel`. However, when Angular's AOT compiler type-checks a template binding like `[preserveContent]=\"true\"`, it needs to import the `DeferredContentAware` type to verify the binding.\n\nThe problem is that `DeferredContentAware` is imported from an internal module:\n\n```typescript\n// From @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (line 4)\nimport { DeferredContentAware } from '@angular/aria/_deferred-content-chunk.js';\n```\n\nThe underscore prefix (`_`) indicates this is a private/internal module, and `DeferredContentAware` is **not re-exported** from `@angular/aria/accordion`.\n\n### The Inconsistency\n\n1. `AccordionPanel` **exposes** `preserveContent` as a usable input via `hostDirectives`\n2. But the **type** required to use this input (`DeferredContentAware`) is **not exported**\n3. This works in JIT mode (development) but **fails in AOT/partial compilation** (library builds)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: Unable to reproduce in StackBlitz as this requires a library build with ng-packagr (partial compilation mode). StackBlitz runs in JIT mode where the issue doesn't manifest.\n\n1. Create an Angular library project using ng-packagr\n2. Create a component that uses `AccordionPanel` with `preserveContent` binding:\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-accordion',\n  imports: [AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent],\n  template: `\n    <div ngAccordionGroup>\n      <button ngAccordionTrigger [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\">Toggle</button>\n      <div ngAccordionPanel\n           [panelId]=\"'panel-1'\"\n           [preserveContent]=\"true\">  <!-- THIS CAUSES NG3004 -->\n        <ng-template ngAccordionContent>\n          <p>Panel content</p>\n        </ng-template>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyAccordionComponent {}\n```\n\n3. Build the library:\n```bash\nng build my-library\n# or\nnpx ng-packagr -p ng-package.json\n```\n\n4. Observe the error:\n```\nNG3004: Unable to import symbol DeferredContentAware.\nThe symbol is not exported from @angular/aria/types/accordion.d.ts (module '@angular/aria/accordion').\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOne of the following:\n\n### Option A: Export `DeferredContentAware` (Preferred)\n\nExport `DeferredContentAware` from `@angular/aria/accordion` so that consumers can use the `preserveContent` input that is already exposed via `hostDirectives`:\n\n```typescript\n// @angular/aria/accordion/index.ts\nexport { DeferredContentAware } from '../_deferred-content-chunk';\nexport { AccordionGroup, AccordionTrigger, AccordionPanel, AccordionContent } from './accordion';\n```\n\n### Option B: Document the limitation\n\nIf `preserveContent` is intentionally internal, remove it from the `hostDirectives` inputs mapping or document that it cannot be used in library builds.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The `preserveContent` input appears to be available (TypeScript/IDE shows it as a valid input)\n- Development mode (JIT) works fine\n- Library builds (AOT partial compilation) fail with `NG3004`\n- There is no workaround - attribute binding `[attr.preserveContent]=\"true\"` bypasses the error but doesn't actually set the signal input value\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 21.0.4\nNode: 24.12.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.6.2\nOS: win32 arm64\n\nAngular: 21.0.6\n@angular/aria: 21.0.5\n@angular/cdk: 21.0.5\n\nBrowser(s): Chrome, Firefox, Safari (not browser-specific)\nOperating System: Windows 11 ARM64 (also reproducible on other platforms)\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Why `preserveContent` is needed\n\nWithout `preserveContent=true`, there can be content duplication issues when combining:\n- `ngAccordionContent` (deferred content)\n- `NgTemplateOutlet` (for user-provided content templates)\n- Native Angular animations (`animate.enter`/`animate.leave`)\n\nWhen the panel visibility changes, the deferred content system destroys/recreates views, which can conflict with animation lifecycle and `NgTemplateOutlet`, resulting in duplicate content appearing in the DOM.\n\n### Current Workaround\n\nThe only workaround is to not use `preserveContent` and avoid combining deferred content with animations - but this limits the functionality that Angular ARIA accordion can provide.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(aria/accordion): `preserveContent` input causes `NG3004` in library builds\" (#32590)"},{"Id":"3757675368","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-23T15:08:31","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"32589","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(devinfra): Get rid of max-line-length stylelint","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nNow that Sass files are autoformatted by a formatter that does not respect line length limits and automatically defeats attempts to manually conform with them, this check serves no purpose other than to force us to add disablings for it.

Every time toggle is hiding / removing the CDK virtual scroll, it adds a new Detached element. \n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should not have any detached element, post GC clean up.\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt have detached element after every toggle.\n\n<img width=\"1206\" height=\"592\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c357e3e-15c0-4e67-80d3-5744cae81df3\" />\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20\n- CDK/Material: 20\n- Browser(s): chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): windows  & macos\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32587","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(scrolling): Detached nodes on virtual scrolling with angular 20\" (#32587)"},{"Id":"3755339628","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-22T21:56:44","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"32585","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/table): Use text-align: start instead of descendent dir…","State":"open","Body":"… selector.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32585","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(material/table): Use text-align: start instead of descendent dir…\" (#32585)"},{"Id":"3752454161","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-22T06:07:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"32582","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pnpm to v10.27.0 (main)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | [Age](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [Adoption](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [Passing](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [Confidence](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/tree/HEAD/pnpm)) | [`10.26.0` -> `10.27.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pnpm/10.26.0/10.27.0) | ![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/pnpm/10.27.0?slim=true) | ![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/pnpm/10.27.0?slim=true) | ![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/pnpm/10.26.0/10.27.0?slim=true) | ![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/pnpm/10.26.0/10.27.0?slim=true) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>\n\n### [`v10.27.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.27.0): pnpm 10.27\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.26.2...v10.27.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Adding `trustPolicyIgnoreAfter` allows you to ignore trust policy checks for packages published more than a specified time ago[#&#8203;10352](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10352).\n\n- Added project registry for global virtual store prune support.\n\n  Projects using the store are now registered via symlinks in `{storeDir}/v10/projects/`. This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.\n\n- Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.\n\n  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:\n\n  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store\n  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages\n  3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable\n\n  This includes support for workspace monorepos - all `node_modules` directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Throw an error if the value of the `tokenHelper` or `<url>:tokenHelper` setting contains an environment variable.\n- Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` settings [#&#8203;10376](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10376).\n- Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories [#&#8203;10384](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10384)\n- Fixed a bug ([#&#8203;9759](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9759)) where `pnpm add` would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to its exact version.\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### [`v10.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.2): pnpm 10.26.2\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.26.1...v10.26.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Improve error message when a package version exists but does not meet the `minimumReleaseAge` constraint. The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., \"released 6 hours ago\") [#&#8203;10307](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).\n\n- Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#&#8203;10335](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).\n\n  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.\n\n- Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#&#8203;10244](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).\n\n- Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#&#8203;10334](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n

This is expected as everything is assumed to be somehow reachable through relative imports.\r\n\r\nWith `rootDirs` that allow for a \"virtual file system\"-like environment, the compiler is not necessarily able to always construct proper relative imports. The compiler includes the `LogicalProjectStrategy` for this reason. This strategy is able to respect `rootDirs` to construct relative paths when possible.\r\n\r\nThis logic currently accidentally triggers when there is a `rootDir` set. This option is not to be confused with the virtual directory option called `rootDirs`. The compiler currently confuses this and accidentally enters this mode when there is just a `rootDir`— breaking in monorepos that imports can point outside the `rootDir` to e.g. other compilation unit's `.d.ts` (which is valid; just not `.ts` sources can live outside the root dir).\r\n\r\nThis is necessary for our Bazel toolchain migration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60555","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler-cli): support relative imports to symbols outside `rootDir`\" (#60555)"},{"Id":"2947378870","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-25T18:08:33","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"60554","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add more details about event replay","State":"open","Body":"This adds a little extra information about event replay and links to the readme for JSAction.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60554","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: add more details about event replay\" (#60554)"},{"Id":"2947235824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-25T17:12:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"60553","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8fa14ab` -> `4ae4a7a` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `be69a70` -> `7dbb19e` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This suggests there must be a bug when using **Node.js@22.2.0**, as Angular SSR applications do not build with this version. A bug report is being opened to address this compatibility issue.\n\nCreated app:\n```\n...>ng new angularapp\n√ Which stylesheet format would you like to use? Sass (SCSS)     [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss\n          ]\n√ Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? Yes\n√ Would you like to use the Server Routing and App Engine APIs (Developer Preview) for this server application? No\n```\n\nAccording to https://angular.dev/reference/versions, this version should be compatible, but just isn't. It just hangs, shows building forever and does not provide any meaningful output (even with verbose).\n\nI hope this helps someone who is stuck with a similar issue.\n\n(used angular version: Angular CLI: 19.2.4)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThere was no error, the build was just in an endless loop and now files where generated, no errors where shown (even with --verbose)\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.4\nNode: 22.2.0 <-- was then working with 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular:\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.4 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.4 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.4 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          19.2.4 (cli-only)\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29918","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 19 SSR Build Fails with Node.js@22.2.0, (Resolved by Upgrading to Node.js@22.14.0)\" (#29918)"},{"Id":"2937277495","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T23:09:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29906","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update devinfra digest to ad960c2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `2707802` -> `ad960c2` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Previously, the hover event triggered the handler immediately, which could result in unwanted handlers showing up when the user quickly moved their cursor over column headers. This change ensures that the handlers only appear if the user pauses (hovers for 300ms) over the column header, preventing handlers from rendering during fast cursor movements.\r\n\r\n### Why this change is suggested:\r\nThe previous implementation immediately triggered the column resize handlers as soon as the user hovered over the column header, which could be distracting or lead to unnecessary renders when the user quickly moves the cursor across the page. By adding a `debounceTime(300)`, we ensure that the hover event only triggers the handler after the user has paused over the column header for at least 300ms, reducing the number of handler renders and making the interaction feel smoother.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents the handlers from appearing if the user is simply passing by the headers or trying to reach another element, improving the overall experience, especially when navigating fast through the UI.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Added `debounceTime(300)` to the `headerCellHoveredDistinct` observable to delay the rendering of handlers until the user has hovered over the header for 300ms.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30709","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(cdk-experimental/column-resize): add debounce to column header h…\" (#30709)"},{"Id":"2946803866","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-25T14:48:44","Actor":"danielolaru91","Number":"30708","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(cdk-experimental/column-resize): improve hover responsiveness of…","State":"open","Body":"… column resize with requestAnimationFrame\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests a performance improvement for the `_updateOverlayHandleHeight()` method in the `cdk-experimental` column resize feature.

Coming from the _pre MDC_ components where it was part of the row, I needed to adopt my styles a bit. And now I'm struggeling over and over with this decision so I wanted to start a discussion about it's pros and cons ... maybe it's not too late.\n\nJust to make sure. I'm only using the flex-version and most of my issues probably only occure here. But that gives me much more styling possibilities I rely on.\n\nThere are two main reasons that are a pain imho having the border being part of the cell:\n\n1. Since the cell needs to start left-most at the table, you are not able to put margins to the cells. Otherwise you would have an offset of the border. I guess that's the reason you put the style `box-sizing: border-box` to the cells. Now that doesn't work with fixed sized columns! If I want to have a column with a fixed sized, I usually put `flex: 0 0 100px;` on it. But since these 100px are including the padding now, my cells have a different width if they are put in the first or second place in the table (https://stackblitz.com/edit/386up7zg). So I needed to set it back to `content-box` what brings me into new problems here and there.\n2.  If I only use columns of a fixed size, the border won't fit the row. The often happens to me if I use multi row templates with a detail only showing a small content (https://stackblitz.com/edit/386up7zg-wtqwvqh9). Sure I could make it auto increase but I use dynamic tables where the useer can place the columns dynamically. And some of them (e.g. columns containing only icons) have a fixed size. If the user puts super much columns on the detail-row, I let them wrap (since they don't provide the column headers). If they wrap, I have a super ugly bottom border and there is no easy way in Css to address only the _last wrapped items_.\n\nPlus: how about giving the table a `display: grid` by default? I'm thinking about it, but don't want to move to far from your style to keep compatibility. The reason is I'd like to have a fixed sized primary row and a detail row always matching it's size. But I don't know how to do it with the container being a `block` (https://stackblitz.com/edit/rpgh7hwj-wtsobk5b).\n\nNow coming to the pros of it ... Yeah, one _could_ have different borders on the cells. Like ... different thicknesses? Or colors? Have you ever seen this out there? Imho this use-case is so niche that one really needing this behavior should rather turn of the row's border and go with a custom cell-border himself.\n\nThank you so much for your effort!\n\nEdit: just checked and noticed that the border actually always was part of the cells (at least since version 8) so there probably is a good reason for it. Not sure why I noticed it with the swap to MDC, guess it was some other style-related thing and I thought it was the border (double-checked: it was the padding change of the flex table that made me aware of it).

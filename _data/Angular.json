I've already made many fixes, and came across this one:\r\n```\r\napp.module.ts:177 [ERROR]:  TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null\r\n    at providersResolver (di_setup.ts:46)\r\n    at Object.definition.providersResolver (providers_feature.ts:48)\r\n    at resolveDirectives (core.js:17)\r\n    at elementStartFirstCreatePass (core.js:19023)\r\n    at ɵɵelementStart (core.js:19023)\r\n    at Module.ɵɵelement (core.js:19023)\r\n    at NWTRecordingControlsNWTRecordingControlsDetailComponent_div_53_div_1_div_4_div_3_div_1_span_1_div_14_Template (nwtrecordingcontrolsnwtrecordingcontrols-detail.component.html:784)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.js:17)\r\n    at renderView (core.js:17)\r\n    at TemplateRef_.createEmbeddedView (core.js:17)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is a bug on our side, but wanted to report this as the error message is extremely unhelpful. \r\n\r\nThe template code that is failing is:\r\n```\r\n        <div [froalaEditor]=\"frOptions\" formControlName=\"NWTTextEditor\" id=\"NWTTextEditor\"\r\n          [NwRecordingValueDirective]=\"{\r\n            actionType: 'setValue',\r\n            configuration: { dataItem: 'NWTTextEditor'},\r\n            actions: ['formChange']\r\n          }\">\r\n        </div>\r\n```\r\nInside of this function:\r\n```\r\nexport function providersResolver<T>(\r\n    def: DirectiveDef<T>, providers: Provider[], viewProviders: Provider[]): void {\r\n  const lView = getLView();\r\n  const tView: TView = lView[TVIEW];\r\n  if (tView.firstCreatePass) {\r\n    const isComponent = isComponentDef(def);\r\n\r\n    // The list of view providers is processed first, and the flags are updated\r\n    resolveProvider(viewProviders, tView.data, tView.blueprint, isComponent, true);\r\n\r\n    // Then, the list of providers is processed, and the flags are updated\r\n    resolveProvider(providers, tView.data, tView.blueprint, isComponent, false);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `lView` that is returned is null. Since the error is not clear, I am not yet sure of the cause. Once I find it, I'll leave a comment here.\r\n\r\nI have `angular-froala-wysiwg` imported locally (fork of https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg) since they don't have a release that works in Angular 9 yet (they latest release is still using the remove Angular Renderer).

This means the test case for `~{for-people}` is not\r\nreflective of the actual use case because the variable is already there!\r\nIn real case, the expression would be incomplete, and our implementation\r\nfailed to take that into account.\r\n\r\nThis commit breaks such test into individual tests, and fix the bugs in\r\nthe underlying implementation.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This no longer seems to work in Ivy because the dirty-state of the component is _reset_ after the view lifecycle hooks have been executed. \r\n\r\nIn View Engine, the order seems slightly different and a component dirty state is reset when it's children have been checked. The lifecycle hooks for the component execute when the parent view is checked. This means that a component can be marked from within the view lifecycle hooks since the dirty state is _not_ reset afterwards (unlike in Ivy)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8eb05964639ea66e602f3c145728cb63ced706cd/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L478 \r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction**:\r\n\r\n[View Engine Demo](https://ng-run.com/edit/Hq5Gbi5wOIsr6Bdymk1q?aot=false&open=app%2Fhello%2Fhello.component.ts)\r\n[Ivy Demo](https://ng-run.com/edit/Hq5Gbi5wOIsr6Bdymk1q?aot=true&open=app%2Fhello%2Fhello.component.ts)\r\n\r\nAlso here is an acceptance test that shows the issue: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30634\r\n\r\nThe test replicates a scenario where `MatCheckbox` calls `markForCheck` in the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook.

Resets \"ChecksEnabled\"/Dirty-Flag for MatCheckbox instance\r\n3.  Runs AfterViewInit hook for children of: MyTestComp (only children is the checkbox; so it runs the checkbox hook)\r\n4.  AfterViewInit Hook of MatCheckbox marked the checkbox as dirty\r\n5.  Runs AfterViewInit hooks for children of [ROOT]\r\n\r\n-> After the change detection cycle, `MatCheckbox` is left as dirty.

And after that options are rendered.\r\n\r\nViewEngine behavior looks rational for me so I wonder if it's need to be fixed for Ivy. The workaround is using `selected` binding on `option` tag.\r\n\r\nPlease do note that similar React code(https://codesandbox.io/s/priceless-pare-lynml)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<select value={3}>\r\n {[1, 2, 3].map(item => <option value={item}>{item}</option>)}\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks the same way as in ViewEngine\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nViewEngine https://ng-run.com/edit/rn9WBjLKXzXUEI8CSE3d\r\nIvy 9.0.0-rc.6 https://ng-run.com/edit/TXJC0ZhJTzrN8aYgUmtH?aot=true","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34470","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy: Can't set default value for 'select' when options are generated dynamically through ngFor\" (#34470)"},{"Id":"539527175","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-18T15:16:50","Actor":"rawfox","Number":"34463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changedetection method detectChanges re-runs change detection on whole component tree","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> in @angular/core  class ChangeDetectorRef\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Problem: when detectChanges runs from component A with onPush strategy, Angular runs change detection on whole component tree.

This can lead to a situation where the SW will never be registered when there is a long-running task (such as an interval or recurring timeout), which can often be started by a 3rd-party dependency (without the developer realizing). Related issues: #20970, #34461\r\n\r\nThis can easily be missed by the developer and there is no other indication other than the SW is not in effect. This is particularly hard to detect, because the SW is typically not used during development and on production builds a previous SW instance might be in effect.\r\n\r\n##\r\n**Possible solutions**\r\n\r\nSince 4cfba5807, it is possible to overwrite this default behavior by [providing a different `SwRegistrationStrategy`][2].

(This won't change the current behavior, but will make it easier for developers to identify the problem.)\r\n\r\n[1]: https://angular.io/api/core/ApplicationRef#is-stable-examples\r\n[2]: https://angular.io/api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#registrationStrategy","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(service-worker): improve default `SwRegistrationStrategy`\" (#34464)"},{"Id":"539463896","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-18T09:40:44","Actor":"postnikovpasha","Number":"34461","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to fetch start URL via service worker.","State":"closed","Body":"The site has stopped seeing service worker.\r\nProblems began after clicking on the \"Clear Site Data\" button.\r\n\r\nThe Application -> Manifest tab says \"No matching service worker detected.

This happens only when enableIvy is set to true. Works fine if enableIvy is set to false. Also aot is set to true in angular.json. Also there is no error shown. Only the parent component is loaded (PageComponent) in this case.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\nconst PAGE_ROUTES: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: ' ',\r\n    component: PageComponent,\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'child1',\r\n        loadChildren: () => import('../../../child1/child1.module').then(m => m.child1Module)\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'child2',\r\n        loadChildren: () => import('../../../child2/child2.module').then(m => m.child2Module)\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf the loadChildren modules are specified directly (shown below) everything works fine even when ivy is enabled.

An example is creating a dialog. I see that angular material has [schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics). It would be nice if there was something for a dialog:\r\n`ng generate @angular/material:dialog <component-name>`\r\n\r\nThis would generate a component like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef } from '@angular/material';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-aggregate-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './aggregate-dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./aggregate-dialog.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class AggregateDialogComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  private _dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>;\r\n  constructor(dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>, @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) data: any) {\r\n    this._dialogRef = dialogRef;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also mean the dialog component would be added to the `entryComponents` in the module.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nDescribe the use case(s) that the proposed feature would enable.\r\nFor dialog-heavy applications, setting up dialogs require quite a few steps. It would be nice if this was a little more streamlined. Given that (I believe) if you want to use an Angular Material dialog, it _requires_ it's own component I think it would be useful for the proper (or common) references to be added when generated. It sounds like the `entryComponents` step won't be needed in `v9`, so that is nice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Schematic for Angular Material Dialog\" (#17994)"},{"Id":"539113753","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T23:38:25","Actor":"devversion","Number":"17990","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: exclude devserver targets from ci test jobs","State":"closed","Body":"We don't want to build the runfile tree's for the executable\r\ndevserver targets.

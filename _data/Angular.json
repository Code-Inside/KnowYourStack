As such, they play well with (conditional) content-projection: \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// don't have to move #tempRef before my-component: can stay before / inside / after\r\n<my-component [someTemplate]=\"tempRef\">\r\n    <ng-template #tempRef>...</ng-template>\r\n</my-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpeaking about content projection (or composition), I have to admit that I've always found angular options not particularly straightforward. In general, mastering content projection in angular requires decent knowledge of: \r\n1. ng-content, \r\n2. ng-template, \r\n3. `#` template variables, \r\n4. [structural directives](https://angular.dev/guide/directives/structural-directives), \r\n5. Ng**Outlet,\r\n6. many other things. \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAssuming that \r\n1. [arrow functions in templates](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/43485) are on their way to be delivered (see [tweet](https://x.com/dylhunn/status/1785465865628266687))\r\n2. and the mental model for `#` template variables cannot be fitted [in the `@let` one](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55848#issue-2302066755), \r\n\r\nI'd like to propose the following changes: \r\n\r\n1. replace `#` annotation with `@ref`:\r\n    1. `@ref=\"varName\"`, \r\n    2. `@ref(ngModel) = \"varName\"`,\r\n2. allow the definition of `@ref` template variables like this\r\n    1. `@ref temp = {<ng-template>...</ng-template>}`,\r\n    2. `@ref temp = (...) => {<ng-template>...</ng-template>}`,\r\n3. Support the render of `@ref` template variables defined in 2.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nSome refactored examples from the current [Understanding template variables](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/reference-variables) and new possibilities for content projection. \r\n\r\nDOM element\r\n```typescript\r\n<input @ref=\"phone\" placeholder=\"phone number\"/>\r\n<button type=\"button\" (click)=\"callPhone(phone.value)\">Call</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent or template\r\n```typescript\r\n<my-tree-component @ref=\"tree\"></my-tree-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nForm\r\n```typescript\r\n<form @ref(ngForm)=\"itemForm\">\r\n  // ...\r\n</form>\r\n\r\n<div [hidden]=\"!itemForm.form.valid\">\r\n  // ...\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nContent projection\r\n```typescript\r\n// consumer-of-my-tree.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'consumer-component',\r\n  // ...\r\n  template: `\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n    @ref customNode = (node) => {\r\n        <ng-template>\r\n            @if (node.desc) {\r\n                {{ node.desc }}\r\n            }\r\n            // manageNodeClick is defined in ConsumerComponent\r\n            <span [class]=\"node.style\" (click)=\"manageNodeClick(node)\">{{ node.label }}</span>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    }\r\n    <my-tree-component [data]=\"dataStructure\" [customNode]=\"customNode\"></my-tree-component>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class ConsumerComponent {...}\r\n\r\n// my-tree.component.ts\r\nexport interface Node {\r\n    id: string;\r\n    desc?: string;\r\n    label: string;\r\n    style: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-tree-component',\r\n  // ...\r\n  template: `\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n    <!-- Of course  the usage of ngTemplateOutlet below \r\n        is just to provide ideas: requires further investigation / adaptations \r\n\r\n        <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"templateRefExp; context: contextExp\"></ng-container>\r\n    -->\r\n\r\n    for (node of nodes; track node.id) {\r\n        @let temp = customNode();\r\n        <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"temp(node)\"></ng-container>\r\n    }\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class MyTreeComponent {\r\n    data = input.required<...>();\r\n\r\n    // I hope something like this is enough for types inference in consumer-of-my-tree.component.ts\r\n    customNode = input<(node: Node) => TemplateRef<any>>();\r\n    \r\n    nodes = signal<Node[]>([]); // populated started from data\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProjection variants\r\n```typescript\r\n// inline function\r\n<my-tree-component [data]=\"dataStructure\" [customNode]=\"(node) => {\r\n    <ng-template>\r\n        <my-custom-node [node]=\"node\"></my-custom-node>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n}\">\r\n</my-tree-component>\r\n\r\n// inline functions \r\n<my-tree-component [data]=\"dataStructure\" \r\n    [customNode]=\"(node) => {\r\n        <ng-template>\r\n            // ...\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n    }\"\r\n    [somethingElse]=\"() => {\r\n        <ng-template>\r\n            // ...\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n}\">\r\n</my-tree-component>\r\n\r\n// cascading\r\n<my-tree-component [data]=\"dataStructure\" \r\n    [customNode]=\"(node) => {\r\n        <ng-template>\r\n            <my-custom-node [node]=\"node\" [somethingElse]=\"() => {\r\n                <ng-template>\r\n                    // ...\r\n                </ng-template>\r\n            }\">\r\n            </my-custom-node>\r\n        </ng-template>\r\n}\">\r\n</my-tree-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Objections\r\n\r\nSome reasonable objections: \r\n\r\n1. *Why don't we leave `#` variables as they are and simply allow `@let temp = (...) => {<ng-template>...</ng-template>}`?* \r\nAnswer: yeah, that would be ideal! Defining a `@ref` variable after its usage, it's really strange. Moreover it will increase confusion between `@let` and `@ref` variables. The point is: I'm not sure it's possible considering the slightly different mental models. Unfortunatelly, I have a limited understanding of the angular compiler... therefore, I went for the `@ref` way (but absolutely `@let` if possible). \r\n\r\n2. *How about viewChild, ... ?* \r\nAnswer: well, for templates like `@ref temp = {<ng-template>...</ng-template>}` I guess it can work as right now (just a different way of definiting a template). Not sure about arrow functions... but assuming 1) can be done, there is no issue. \r\n\r\n3. *Your new `@ref` definition is not real ts* \r\nAnswer: that's true... as it's not real ts the following `@let user = user$ | async ?? 'unknonw'`. The idea behind `@ref temp = (...) => {<ng-template>...</ng-template>}` is to be familiar, not valid ts. Anyway: the proposal can be adapted if [43485](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14129) is strictly required. \r\n\r\n4. *Why doing things in a different way? You already have all the tools to achieve content projection needs* \r\nAnswer: true! But on the other hand, I think simple / familiar things are always better: more likely to be used due to better DX. Mastering the current angular content projection is not easy... especially if you're coming from other frameworks. \r\n\r\n5. *Maybe more complicated, but the current angular content projection (see material) is more readable because it's more semanatic* \r\nAnswer: that's true! On the other hand, if you declutter the examples above (remove `<ng-template>`) the semantic beauty comes back. Just a different taste! I believe the upcoming DX for components can entirely fix this problem. \r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI hope I haven't written anything so stupid to regret it for the coming weeks (😅)! The main goal of this issue is to propose an expansion of the current content projection capabilities. But due to the ongoing development of `@let` and my limited understanding of the angular compiler, I might have proposed something very difficult to achieve (or stupid). In case, sorry for this! \r\n\r\nAnd yes, the intention would be to make angular content projection similar to what React is doing (which is cool and easy when components are just functions). Mentally, I tried to make the following 'React unit test' passing: \r\n\r\n- ng_dev: \"hey buddy, you wanna see the latest from ng content projection?\"\r\n- react_dev: \"Is it fixing the web? Cause you know....  Let me check: well, it looks...\", \r\n- ng_dev: \"familiar, right? props <-> inputs, component bindings <-> (...) => {...}!\"\r\n- react_dev: \"Umh... yeah\", \r\n- ng_dev: \"more interested in some angular coding?\" 😄\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: thanks a lot for the amazing work you're doing!

A page with high relevancy would be https://angular.dev/guide/di or https://angular.dev/guide/di/dependency-injection.\r\n\r\nThe results for this query are: \r\n- [Testing Services - Testing services with the TestBed](https://angular.dev/guide/testing/services#testing-services-with-the-testbed)\r\n- [Interceptors - Configuring Interceptors](https://angular.dev/guide/http/interceptors#configuring-interceptors)\r\n- [Common Routing Tasks - LocationStrategy and browser URL styles](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks#locationstrategy-and-browser-url-styles)\r\n- [DevTools overview - Visualize resolution paths](https://angular.dev/tools/devtools#visualize-resolution-paths)\r\n- 4 reference results leading to pages about errors, the roadmap and ngModule explanation.\r\n\r\nThe search experience varies per query. Searching for `HttpClient` for example does show some results from the HttpClient guide, but those results will direct you to a very specific subsection of the guide, requiring you to navigate/search within the guide to find relevant general info. (e.g. first result for `HttpClient` is [Interceptors - Configuring Interceptors](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup#withinterceptorsfromdi) where the overview page https://angular.dev/guide/http would be more relevant as I did not include anything about interceptors in my query).\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Algolia, but I would expect that they offer a way to add a relevancy weighting to indexed pages for certain search terms.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI would hope to get relevant search results, which require minimal navigating through guides to find relevant info.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56035","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: Algolia search needs to be optimized\" (#56035)"},{"Id":"2312573221","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T10:41:57","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56034","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update version support","State":"open","Body":"fixes #56033\r\n\r\nPer #54961, TS minimum is now 5.4 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56034","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update version support\" (#56034)"},{"Id":"2312565730","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T10:38:17","Actor":"json-derulo","Number":"56033","RawContent":null,"Title":"Version compatibility table missing entry for v18","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe version compatibility table doesn't include an entry for v18.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/reference/versions#actively-supported-versions\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56033","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Version compatibility table missing entry for v18\" (#56033)"},{"Id":"2312516770","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T10:18:57","Actor":"furtivite","Number":"56032","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cant't fing image","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nIn the tutorial, I need to insert a picture into the test house.

If I understand the implementation a fallback mechanism to webpack is used in case a feature is not (yet) supported by vite (like e.g. `wasm` web assembly).\r\n\r\nThe official documentation recommends to write custom plugins if the default ones to not provide the features required. To get more control over `esbuild` plugins and to evaluate the possibility to use existing vite plugins I've contacted the people from the [angular-builders](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/) project and opened a feature request there:\r\n➡️ [[Feature Request] - Support to use/add Vite loader plugins](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/issues/1721)\r\n\r\nI've created a POC, but realized that I can not inject vite custom configuration without modifying `angular-cli` builder - or to re-implement it's functions.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable if we could derive a custom builder from the vanilla one to add this feature. The respective configuration is currently not available.\r\n\r\nThe POC also showed that not all vite plugins will work properly with angular - so I understand that this will not be supported by the angular team. But it would be nice if the possibility exists for projects to derive from the code and provide/support custom plugins.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be desirable that it is easier to derive from the default build / serve implementations to customize them (in this case custom vite config - similar to webpack). This would allow other projects to leverage the existing implementation without hacks and the support of the added or changed functions would be with the respective project (not the core angular team).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAt the moment we fall back to webpack - but we've to consider to drop either the `wasm` packages and replace them with something else; and even switching the framework to `vue` was considered by the team.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27695","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature][Vite] Add support for external vite.config.js\" (#27695)"},{"Id":"2312012986","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T05:51:54","Actor":"tobiasge","Number":"27691","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng new creates application with deprecated RouterTestingModule","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen creating a new application I didn't expect the usage of a deprecated module in my `app.component.spec.ts` file.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nng new --inline-style false --inline-template false --package-manager bun --routing --skip-git --standalone false --strict true --ssr false --style scss my-test-app\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.0\r\nNode: 20.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: bun 1.1.9\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng new creates application with deprecated RouterTestingModule\" (#27691)"},{"Id":"2311961716","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-23T05:15:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27690","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/build-tooling](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-build-tooling-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `fcf8e80` -> `adf903f` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a1f1b08` -> `708b5ac` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `09b528c` -> `fe092d4` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `62148d3` -> `dc39a7b` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `984351f` -> `2d96066` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `89624a6` -> `4bc5d5c` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Two of the applications were passing fine on Angular 17.2.0 but failed after upgrading to 17.3.7. The third application was a new one that was created on 17.3.7 to just for testing purses.\r\n\r\nStandard jest tests, eg testing 'Hello world' are passing. But anything using schematics is throwing with the error The encoded data was not valid for encoding utf-8.\r\n\r\n## Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate a new Angular application on 17.3.7 (latest version). Change to using Jest. Create a unit test that uses any schematics, and it throws with an encoding utf-8 error.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpect test to be able to run against anything with schematics, not to straight away fail. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nTest file example:\r\n\r\n```import { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } from 'util'\r\nglobal.TextEncoder = TextEncoder\r\n//

as path from 'path';\r\nconst collectionPath = path.join(__dirname, '../collection.json');\r\n\r\ndescribe('hello-world', () => {\r\n  it('works', async () => {\r\n    const runner = new SchematicTestRunner('schematics', collectionPath);\r\n    const tree = await runner.runSchematic('hello-world', {}, Tree.empty());\r\n    expect(tree.files).toEqual([]);\r\n  });\r\n  it('works', async () => {\r\n    const workspaceOptions = {\r\n      name: 'workspace',\r\n      newProjectRoot: 'projects',\r\n      version: '7.0.0',\r\n    };\r\n    const defaultAppOptions = {\r\n      name:

const runner = new SchematicTestRunner('schematics', collectionPath);\r\n    const workspaceTree = await runner.runExternalSchematic(\r\n      '@schematics/angular',\r\n      'workspace',\r\n

In particular I have noticed this causes legibility issues for the floating placeholder on form fields and the label text on default-appearance buttons, but it might apply to other components as well.\r\n\r\nMy theme is configured as follows:\r\n\r\n`$my-palette: mat.define-palette($greens, 600, 200, 900, 700);`\r\nNote that the $text hue is overridden to `700` in the call to `define-palette`.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot showing the 700 hue being correctly applied to the aforementioned text elements under the legacy components:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/4996462/2739e6f4-784d-41a3-81b6-4f4ee4741aa7)\r\n\r\nAnd here is how the new MDC components look:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/4996462/a57571a7-f795-4c5a-8ba5-ba4d551d5b22)\r\n\r\nI had a hard time reading the Angular Material => MDC SCSS theming code but it seems like the $text hue preference isn't being passed to the MDC mixins in any way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-9ugktp?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\n2.

Recall that the config `aio_local_deps` stamps angular packages to the version of angular found in `aio/package.json`. This is to trick the CLI/architect into thinking that the local angular packages are the same major version, as it complains otherwise. The AIO app angular deps were updated to 15, but the shared example ones were not. When the example tests ran, the cli was on v14 trying to load angular packages stamped as 15 and failed. Making the versions consistent between `aio/package.json` and `aio/tools/examples/shared/package.json` fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47948","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(bazel): post-rebase AIO regressions\" (#47948)"},{"Id":"1433821381","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-02T21:42:00","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"47947","RawContent":null,"Title":"[14.2.x] fix(core): hardening rules related to the attribute order on iframe elements","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the logic related to the attribute order on iframes and makes the rules more strict.

The idea is, that \"plugins\" (remotes) can define their routes and are \"plugged\" into the application (shell) itself without the shell knowing anything about the remote. This works fine by getting all injected routes of the \"lazy-loaded\" module:\r\n```\r\nconst module = await import('./lazy/lazy.module');\r\nconst moduleRef = createNgModuleRef(module.LazyModule);\r\nconst routes = moduleRef.injector.get(ROUTES, [], InjectFlags.Self);\r\n``` \r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that the injector of any component in the `LazyModule` is the root injector.  After a lot of fiddling, I found out that you can set the injector (and I am assuming this is how the lazy-loaded route does it):\r\n```  \r\nconst lazyRoute = routes[0][0];\r\n// The injector can be defined by updating this not exposed property\r\n(lazyRoute as any)._injector = moduleRef.injector;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nHowever, as you can see, the `_injector` is internal and I need to cast the injector. \r\n\r\nHere is a full stackblitz as an example:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-h4cksn?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts%3AL27\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMake `_injector` public exposed from the `Route` type and document it. Remove the `_`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no currently defined way of loading a route lazy without defining it in `loadChildren`. So for the above use-case of \"plugins\", there is no real alternative.

For example, when writing an\r\ninline functional resolver today, the function is typed as `any` and\r\ndoes not provide completions for the `ResolveFn` parameters. By\r\nrestricting the type to only `ResolveFn`, in the example below\r\nTypeScript would be able to correctly identify the `route` parameter as\r\n`ActivatedRouteSnapshot` and when authoring the inline route, the\r\nlanguage service would be able to autocomplete the function parameters.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst userRoute: Route = {\r\n  path: 'user/:id',\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    \"user\": (route) => inject(UserService).getUser(route.params['id']);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportantly, this deprecation only affects the support for class and\r\n`InjectionToken` guards at the `Route` definition. `Injectable` classes\r\nand `InjectionToken` providers are _not_ being deprecated in the general\r\nsense. Functional guards are robust enough to even support the existing\r\nclass-based guards through a transform:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction mapToCanMatch(providers: Array<Type<{canMatch: CanMatchFn}>>): CanMatchFn[] {\r\n  return providers.map(provider => (...params) => inject(provider).canMatch(...params));\r\n}\r\nconst route = {\r\n  path: 'admin',\r\n  canMatch: mapToCanMatch([AdminGuard]),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith regards to tests, because of the ability to map `Injectable`\r\nclasses to guard functions as outlined above, nothing _needs_ to change\r\nif projects prefer testing guards the way they do today. Functional\r\nguards can also be written in a way that's either testable with\r\n`runInContext` or by passing mock implementations of dependencies.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function myGuardWithMockableDeps(\r\n  dep1 = inject(MyService),\r\n  dep2 = inject(MyService2),\r\n  dep3 = inject(MyService3),\r\n) { }\r\n\r\nconst route = {\r\n  path: 'admin',\r\n  canActivate: [() => myGuardWithMockableDeps()]\r\n}\r\n\r\n// test file\r\nconst guardResultWithMockDeps = myGuardWithMockableDeps(mockService1, mockService2, mockService3);\r\nconst guardResultWithRealDeps = TestBed.inject(EnvironmentInjector).runInContext(myGuardWithMockableDeps);\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47924","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Deprecate class and `InjectionToken` guards and resolvers\" (#47924)"},{"Id":"1430156459","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-31T16:47:39","Actor":"bravery08","Number":"47923","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Brooke Avery to GDE resources ","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The ng generate schematic did the opposite, although since the typography levels have changed for MDC, this would show an error in the console and break the typography configurations when overriding. This change just leaves the `define-legacy-typography-config` function call and adds a TODO comment to update the typography levels when values are being overriden. We should do the mappings automatically if possible as well in a future PR.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25906","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/schematics): replace legacy typography config function transformation with a TODO comment in ng generate\" (#25906)"},{"Id":"1433143023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-02T16:56:24","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25909","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/overlay): provide Overlay in root","State":"closed","Body":"Switches the `Overlay` injectable to be provided at the root.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25909","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/overlay): provide Overlay in root\" (#25909)"},{"Id":"1433059444","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-02T16:42:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25907","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): migrate named arguments in define-typography-config","State":"closed","Body":"`define-typography-config` changed the names of the typography levels in MDC which is a breaking change.

Only a few milliseconds to prevent flashing menus when you just move the mouse around. The user can still click on a nested item to trigger the menu instantly. This will improve the UX. It's really annoying if the menus are flashing.\r\n\r\nYou can test my suggested behavior in other proven menus like in Windows 10. Just open a folder and open the context menu. You'll see that the nested menus don't open immediately. They are delayed. Same behavior in VSCode. A shorter delay than the Windows menus, but they are delayed.

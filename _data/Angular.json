know!\nJust comment on our [Adoption Discussion](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/discussions/1000).\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n\n```starlark\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_js\", version = \"2.3.0\")\n\n####### Node.js version #########\n\n### By default you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @&#8203;rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\n### Optionally you can pin a different node version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@&#8203;rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"16.14.2\")\n\n#################################\n\nnpm = use_extension(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"npm\", dev_dependency = True)\n\nnpm.npm_translate_lock(\n    name = \"npm\",\n    pnpm_lock = \"//:pnpm-lock.yaml\",\n    verify_node_modules_ignored = \"//:.bazelignore\",\n)\n\nuse_repo(npm, \"npm\")\n\npnpm = use_extension(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"pnpm\")\n\n### Allows developers to use the matching pnpm version, for example:\n### bazel run -- @&#8203;pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\n```\n\n#### Using WORKSPACE\n\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@&#8203;bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"aspect_rules_js\",\n    sha256 =

The regression observed in the Main Branch is attributed to the newly added header flushing logic. \r\n\r\nWhen compared to the 19.2.x branch, the optimized code delivers similar performance. Latency is slightly reduced, while request throughput (Req/Sec) and data transfer rate (Bytes/Sec) have seen a slight increase.

Coming from the _pre MDC_ components where it was part of the row, I needed to adopt my styles a bit. And now I'm struggeling over and over with this decision so I wanted to start a discussion about it's pros and cons ... maybe it's not too late.\n\nJust to make sure. I'm only using the flex-version and most of my issues probably only occure here. But that gives me much more styling possibilities I rely on.\n\nThere are two main reasons that are a pain imho having the border being part of the cell:\n\n1. Since the cell needs to start left-most at the table, you are not able to put margins to the cells. Otherwise you would have an offset of the border. I guess that's the reason you put the style `box-sizing: border-box` to the cells. Now that doesn't work with fixed sized columns! If I want to have a column with a fixed sized, I usually put `flex: 0 0 100px;` on it. But since these 100px are including the padding now, my cells have a different width if they are put in the first or second place in the table (https://stackblitz.com/edit/386up7zg). So I needed to set it back to `content-box` what brings me into new problems here and there.\n2.  If I only use columns of a fixed size, the border won't fit the row. The often happens to me if I use multi row templates with a detail only showing a small content (https://stackblitz.com/edit/386up7zg-wtqwvqh9). Sure I could make it auto increase but I use dynamic tables where the useer can place the columns dynamically. And some of them (e.g. columns containing only icons) have a fixed size. If the user puts super much columns on the detail-row, I let them wrap (since they don't provide the column headers). If they wrap, I have a super ugly bottom border and there is no easy way in Css to address only the _last wrapped items_.\n\nPlus: how about giving the table a `display: grid` by default? I'm thinking about it, but don't want to move to far from your style to keep compatibility. The reason is I'd like to have a fixed sized primary row and a detail row always matching it's size. But I don't know how to do it with the container being a `block` (https://stackblitz.com/edit/rpgh7hwj-wtsobk5b).\n\nNow coming to the pros of it ... Yeah, one _could_ have different borders on the cells. Like ... different thicknesses? Or colors? Have you ever seen this out there? Imho this use-case is so niche that one really needing this behavior should rather turn of the row's border and go with a custom cell-border himself.\n\nThank you so much for your effort!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatTable): Bottom border on row (instead of cell)\" (#30689)"},{"Id":"2936098499","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T19:59:58","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30671","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/theming): fix incorrect type annotation","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30671","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(material/theming): fix incorrect type annotation\" (#30671)"},{"Id":"2936384237","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T16:54:37","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30675","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Patch Version] build: remove unused madge and material.angular.io image optimization","State":"closed","Body":"Remove the unused madge dependency and the image optimization scripts for material.angular.io along with its no longer used dependencies","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30675","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Patch Version] build: remove unused madge and material.angular.io image optimization\" (#30675)"},{"Id":"2936372166","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T16:54:21","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30674","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove unused madge and material.angular.io image optimization","State":"closed","Body":"Remove the unused madge dependency and the image optimization scripts for material.angular.io along with its no longer used dependencies","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30674","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: remove unused madge and material.angular.io image optimization\" (#30674)"},{"Id":"2938700548","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T15:09:33","Actor":"RobinKamps","Number":"30687","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Paginator): prevent hover and focus on mouse and touch interactions to disabled buttons","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe disabled paginator buttons have a hover and focus state (e.g. on mouse hover / click (or touch)).\n\n(https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30627 only fixed the tab / keyboard focus of disabled paginator buttons.)\n\nE.g.: https://material.angular.io/components/paginator/overview\n\nOther disabled buttons do not display hover or focused states:\nE.g.: https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview\n\nPlease remove this behaviour from paginator disabled buttons.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/paginator/overview\n\nmove your mouse over the disabled paginator button to see hover layer.\nclick to focus the disabled button to see the focus layer.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo hover and bno focus of disabled buttons.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nHover and Focus layer of disabled buttons are shown.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: latest\n- CDK/Material: latest\n- Browser(s): Chrome / latest\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30687","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Paginator): prevent hover and focus on mouse and touch interactions to disabled buttons\" (#30687)"},{"Id":"2938013602","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T14:51:10","Actor":"JuNe98","Number":"30686","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-menu): Attempting to attach an unknown Portal type","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nSince `@angular/material` version `19.2.4` I am getting the following error when I try to open a `mat-menu`:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5550951-412d-4181-8a6f-bfbbc4ab0ab2)\n\nIt works smoothly with any Angular Material version before 19.2.4.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI was not able to reproduce this bug in stackblitz.

This is expected for proper code splitting, and also for our upcoming `rules_js` migration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this highlights an issue with the Angular compiler. We occasionally re-export other entry-point modules from one entry-point module. This is likely done for convenience, but we should stop doing that going forward (and likely will naturally resolve this over time with standalone either way).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the Angular compiler, especially with HMR enabled (i.e. no tree-shaking of imports), will try to generate imports in the user code to symbols that are indirectly re-exported. This worked before because the Angular compiler leveraged the \"best guessed module\", based on the \"last module import\" it saw before e.g. discovering the re-exported `ScrollingModule`; hence it assumed all exports of that module are available from `@angular/cdk/scrolling`. This assumption no longer works because the last module import would be e.g. `cdk/overlay`, which relatively imports from scrolling to re-export the module then.\r\n\r\nThere are a few options:\r\n\r\n- teach the compiler about relative imports inside APF packages with secondary entry-points. Possible, but won't work for users with older compiler versions. Maybe a long-term good thing to do; on the other hand, standalone is the new future.\r\n\r\n- switch back to module imports. Not possible and relative imports should work inside a package IMO.\r\n\r\n- re-export the exposed symbols, under a private name. This is the easiest approach and there also aren't a lot of module re-exports; so this is a viable approach taken by this commit.\r\n\r\nFixes #30663.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30667","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): ensure re-exported module symbols can be imported\" (#30667)"},{"Id":"2935578679","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T15:55:12","Actor":"grichards23","Number":"30669","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE TS-993004: Unable to import directive Dir.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating my npm packages today, seems there is an issue with the Dir directive, which I'm not even leveraging explicitly.\n\nHave virtual scrolling implemented in a number of components in our application.\nAfter upgrading to @angular/cdk 19.2.4, all those components are reporting import issues with the above directive while running the development server (ng serve)\n\nI've attempted to also import the BidiModule to see if that would clear the errors in the console and it does not.\n\n---------\n\n[ERROR] TS-993004: Unable to import directive Dir.\n  The symbol is not exported from C:/....../node_modules/@angular/cdk/scrolling/index.d.ts (module '@angular/cdk/scrolling').

You have a `lazy` route. Let's call it `LazyComponent`.\r\n2. After deploying that lazy route has a separate chunk with a unique id. Something like that `lazy-4XF37HCG.js`.\r\n3. A user opens the deployed app at different (from lazy) route. Let it be `/dashboard` route. At this point browser downloads `index.html` which has our lazy `lazy-4XF37HCG.js` in its `scripts`.\r\n4. The user stays there for a bit.\r\n5. We deploy a new version. The lazy route's chunk has different id, so now it looks different `lazy-VLNJ76V74.js`.\r\n6. Now user decides to open the lazy route and their attempt fails with the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

Milhões de usuários postam fotos e vídeos todos os dias, por isso muitas pessoas estão curiosas para saber como hackear um perfil do Instagram. Porém, é viável? E jurídico? Este ͏artigo discutirá͏os vários métodos para ͏ing͏perfis do Instagram,͏o que poderia acontecer se você fizer isso e͏algumas ͏dicas para͏garantir que seu perfil permaneça seguro.\r\n\r\nO que é Instagram?\r\n\r\nO Instagram se tornou uma plataforma de mídia social amplamente utilizada, onde os usuários podem postar fotos e vídeos para seus seguidores verem. O aplicativo tomou conta do Facebook durante 2012, tornando-se um dos principais espaços de compartilhamento de fotos em todo o mundo. ͏Com elementos como Stories de mensagens diretas e IGTV, o Instagram desempenha um papel crucial ͏na interação social diária de muitas pessoas͏.\r\n\r\nÉ possível hackear o Instagram?\r\n\r\nNão importa onde você esteja, nossos serviços estão sempre acessíveis, prontos para fornecer soluções rápidas e eficientes. Prometemos recuperar mensagens excluídas e acessar informações que você acreditava estarem perdidas.\r\n\r\nCertamente é possível acessar o Instagram, mas não é um passeio no parque e acarreta uma potencial reação negativa. Os hackers têm várias maneiras de tentar acessar uma conta, desde simplesmente tentar obter a senha até movimentos mais sofisticados, como truques fraudulentos ou brincar com a cabeça das pessoas. Cada abordagem acarreta seus próprios perigos e possíveis consequências.\r\n\r\nMétodos para hackear o Instagram\r\n\r\nCom o auxílio dos nossos especialistas, hackear uma conta do Instagram online se torna mais acessível do que você pensa. Nosso site é intuitivo e projetado para garantir que qualquer pessoa possa usá-lo sem problemas, mantendo sua eficácia intacta.\r\n\r\n͏Uma forma comum de acessar ͏uma conta do Instagram é adivinhando sua senha. Hackers que conseguem descobrir a senha de uma pessoa podem acessar seu perfil. É por isso que é importante que as pessoas escolham senhas para o Instagram que sejam seguras e diferentes das de todo mundo.\r\n\r\nHackear o Instagram geralmente envolve ataques de força bruta. Nesse caso, o hacker utiliza programas que tentam todas as combinações possíveis de caracteres, incluindo letras, números e símbolos, até que a senha correta seja descoberta. Embora esta abordagem possa ser demorada, ela pode funcionar, especialmente se a senha da pessoa não for forte.\r\n\r\nPhishing é uma forma mais complicada de hackear um perfil do Instagram. Nesse tipo de ataque, o hacker cria um site falso ou envia e-mails falsos que parecem ser realmente do Instagram. Eles então usam métodos enganosos para induzir as pessoas a inserir seus detalhes de login nessas páginas e e-mails falsos. Quando um hacker obtém os dados de login de alguém, ele obtém acesso à conta dessa pessoa.\r\n\r\nDicas para manter sua conta do Instagram segura\r\n\r\nFelizmente, existem algumas ações simples que você pode realizar para manter sua conta do Instagram segura. Para começar, certifique-se de usar uma senha forte e incomum para sua conta. Em seguida, tome cuidado com os links e e-mails em que você decide clicar. Verifique a confiabilidade da sua fonte ͏antes de acessar qualquer link ou inserir informações de login.\r\n\r\nConclusão\r\n\r\nHackear uma conta do Instagram depende diretamente do programa usado e de manter as atualizações em dia. Com o uso de VPNs, IPs dedicados e a abordagem certa, podemos facilitar o acesso mesmo às senhas mais complicadas. Hackear o Instagram é difícil, mas possível com as ferramentas e estratégias certas. \r\n\r\n👉🏻👉🏻 Acesse https://hackersgrupos.store\r\n👉🏻👉🏻 Converse diretamente com a gente https://t.me/servicoetersec\r\n\r\nComo hackear uma conta do Instagram.com hackear a senha do Instagram.com sem que eles percebam como hackear um Instagram.com sem que eles percebam como hackear o Instagram.com fácil sem baixar nada apenas 2 passos hackear em 1 minuto por programa como hackear instagram de alguem como hackear conta de instaram hackear instagram\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nComo Hackear Instagram com Software Especializado (github)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56956","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Como Hackear Instagram com Software Especializado (github)\" (#56956)"},{"Id":"2404807873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-12T06:52:49","Actor":"omtagline","Number":"56957","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add Dependency Support to effect Function in Angular","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the effect function in Angular, it's currently not possible to pass dependencies. As a result, all effects run regardless of specific event changes. This limitation reduces the efficiency and control over effect executions, particularly in complex applications.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Create an Angular component that uses the effect function.\r\n2. Attempt to pass dependencies to control when the effect should run.\r\n3. Observe that the effect runs on every change, not respecting the intended dependencies.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    effect(() => {\r\n      console.log('Effect running');\r\n    }, [/* dependencies */]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nThe effect function should accept a dependencies array to control when the effect should re-run. This would enable the effect to run only when specified dependencies change, similar to the behavior of React's useEffect hook.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nThe effect function runs on every change, ignoring the lack of dependency support. This leads to unnecessary executions and potential performance issues.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n`export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    effect(() => {\r\n      console.log('Effect running');\r\n    }, [/* dependencies */]);\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n\r\n**Suggested Solution**\r\n_Enhance the theEffect function to accept a second parameter, which is an array of dependencies. The effect should re-run only when one or more of these dependencies change._\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n```\r\nexport class ExampleComponent implements OnChanges {\r\n\r\n  @Input() dependency1: any;\r\n  @Input() dependency2: any;\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\r\n    if (changes['dependency1'] || changes['dependency2']) {\r\n      this.runEffect();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  runEffect(): void {\r\n    console.log('Effect running');\r\n    // Your effect logic here\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- can Use This But It Not Working With Input Signal ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56957","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add Dependency Support to effect Function in Angular\" (#56957)"},{"Id":"2404471676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-12T01:23:37","Actor":"homerlsy","Number":"56955","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update structural-directives.md select to [select]","State":"open","Body":"this custom directive's selector should be [select]\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So each of those modules (like economy, locations and many more that I've omitted) have `RouterModule.forChild()` with the inner routes for every child component.\r\n\r\nNotice the commented out \"accounting\" route. It's the only route that directly lazy-loads a standalone component. It's done this way because the library it uses now requires it to be standalone.\r\n\r\nHere's the issue though. While trying to expand the \"accounting\" route to become a module like every other module (to have more routes inside) and simply import the AccountingDashboardComponent into that new module, I noticed that the runtime is broken with a random error `Error: Invalid provider for the NgModule 'NgxsRootModule' - only instances of Provider and Type are allowed, got: [..., ..., ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...]`.\r\n\r\nIn fact it doesn't even work if I **remove** the lazy-loading and directly state `component: AccountingDashboardComponent` for that route. In fact, and that's the weirdest part, it will fail even if I remove the \"accounting\" route completely...\r\n\r\nDays of digging into this have lead me to conclusion that it has been broken in the version 18, because I can easily remove the route in my old branch that uses Angular 17 and everything's fine.\r\n\r\nMore specifically I found that in Angular 18 _I basically have to have at least one standalone component in my router in order for it to stop erroring_. I turned `ResetPasswordModule` (which only represents one component) into a standalone component and imported it directly into the router via `loadComponent` and that eliminated the error. Now I can update my old \"accounting\" route without any errors.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly not the resolution I want, something's not right, I want to understand it and fix it. I don't have to be forced to use standalone components this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: Invalid provider for the NgModule 'NgxsRootModule' - only instances of Provider and Type are allowed, got: [..., ..., ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ?undefined?, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.0.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms    \r\n... language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server     \r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nwebpack                         5.91.0\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I couldn't create a reproduction of the bug.

Namely, there seems to be a [pollyfill](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/a7fcc43fdb6b6edc58f781fe96328f4867f4b33e/internal/runtime/runtime.go#L392-L393) for `yield *` that attempts to access `Symbol.asyncIterator` which is not technically correct when the generator or iterable is fully synchronous / only exposes `Symbol.iterator`.

The presence of the import attribute takes precedence over all other loading behavior including JS/TS and any `loader` build option values. This allows per file control over loading behavior. For general loading for all files of an otherwise unsupported file type, the `loader` build option is recommended.\r\n\r\nFor the import attribute, the following loader values are supported:\r\n* `text` - inlines the content as a string\r\n* `binary` - inlines the content as a Uint8Array\r\n* `file` - emits the file and provides the runtime location of the file\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this time, TypeScript does not support type definitions that are based on import attribute values. The use of `@ts-expect-error` or the use of individual type definition files (assuming the file is only imported with the same loader attribute) is currently required.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TypeScript `module` option must be set to `esnext` to allow TypeScript to successfully build the application code.\r\n\r\nAs an example, an SVG file can be imported as text via:\r\n```\r\n// @ts-expect-error TypeScript cannot provide types based on attributes yet\r\nimport contents from './some-file.svg' with { loader: 'text' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the development server and a file that is referenced from a Node.js package with a loader attribute, the package must be excluded from prebundling via the development server `prebundle` option. This does not apply to relative file references.\r\n\r\nThis feature provides the bundling aspects of #26575. TypeScript type definition support would provide the full feature set for that issue but is currently blocked on TypeScript upstream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28040","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): support import attribute based loader configuration\" (#28040)"},{"Id":"2404001024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T19:59:39","Actor":"kfrederix","Number":"28039","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): remove Vite \"/@id/\" prefix for explicit external dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a Vite plugin to remove the `/@id/` prefix (which gets inserted by Vite during import-analysis) for explicit externalDependencies.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I would be more than willing to submit a PR after discussion.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere's a StackBlitz link with a simple repro case:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rbro7s?file=angular.json\r\n\r\n1. `rxjs` and `rxjs/operators` are declared as `externalDependencies`\r\n2. importmap is added in index.html to resolve these dependencies at runtime\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n﻿Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

Also I have a master checkbox to select everything in the current filter scope. To support large datasets I also have an option for `virtual scrolling`.\r\n\r\nSince I allow filtering, the source set of the list is constantly changing which clears the selection if an option is filtered out. To prevent this, I use the angular `SelectionModel` and the callbacks of the mat-list-options. But here is the problem:\r\n\r\nSince the options are destroyed and recreated while scrolling through the viewport, the `selectedChange` event of the option is triggered with the initial unselected state of an option, so an option deselects itself when being recreated. But since this does not happen all the time, it seems there is a race between `(selectedChange)` and `[selected]`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-iidbcx\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Trigger the master check-box\r\n2. scroll\r\n3. see the master changes to indeterminate since check-boxes deselect themself\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the inital `selected = false` when creating the component is not emitted as an event\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInital `selected = false` when creating the component is emitted as an event and selected itself. But not always --> race\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.0.7\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.6\r\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, common, compiler\r\n... compiler-cli, core, forms, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.7","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-selection-list): mat-list-option deselecting itself when recreated in virtual-scroll-viewport\" (#29426)"},{"Id":"2403689410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T21:54:42","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29423","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update getting started","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the Getting Started guide:\r\n- Change links from angular.io to angular.dev\r\n- Update guidance on importing the components (default to standalone guidance)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29423","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update getting started\" (#29423)"},{"Id":"2404074340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T20:36:37","Actor":"urugator","Number":"29425","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/coercion): `coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` has invalid implementation or signature","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n`coerceNumberProperty(thing, undefined)` works the same way as `coerceNumberProperty(thing)`, so it yields `0` if the `thing` isn't coercible to number.

The problem is that when the `MatFormFieldControl` implementation changes dynamically the field always has the initial MatFormFieldControl CSS class, for example if the initial control is a `mat-input` and later changes to a `mat-select` the CSS class on the field will always be `mat-mdc-form-field-type-mat-input`\r\n\r\nNote: The documentation says the prefix for the generated CSS class is `mat-form-field-type` but the real ones have the prefix `mat-mdc-form-field-type`. This could be a documentation bug or a regression from the legacy controls, but the prefix is a different bug that this one I am reporting.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qbaesq\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

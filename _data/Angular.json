It is fairly straightforward.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nIn case the file input gets interacted with before hydration the `'change'` events will be captured by event replay. But my `'change'` event listener reads the most recent `files` property on the input element which got meanwhile reset by `writeValue()` by the time the captured event gets replayed.\n\nAs a result event replay is not working as expected and the form field basically gets reset during hydration as described in #53917.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince Angular already supports selecting function arguments with an expression I would like to propose using that expression to cache the function arguments when capturing an event.\n\nIn case of my example the flow would be like this:\n\n- The prerendered page loads with a pristine file input.\n- The user selects a file.\n- Event replay captures the `'change'` event **and evaluates the function argument selector `('$event.target.files ?? null')`**. It will cache the result.\n- The component taking care of the file input hydrates. It calls `writeValue()` with the initial value.\n- Event replay invokes the `'change'` event handler with the previously cached arguments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nFor now I'm using an internal boolean flag to avoid setting the initial value.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  #wroteFirstValue = false;\n\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    if (this.#wroteFirstValue) {\n      this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n    } else {\n      this.#wroteFirstValue = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nBut this only works because the `ControlValueAccessor` implementation knows it deals with a prerendered file input and the initial value is actually the native default value. I would prefer to have a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation which doesn't need to know anything about the outside conditions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60151","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Event replay could cache function arguments\" (#60151)"},{"Id":"2885710051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-27T22:07:51","Actor":"tsc036","Number":"60150","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: cleanup untracked in core","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

They go through the same mechanisms as the template, meaning that they'll behave in the same way as input and output bindings in the template. For example, `outputBinding` will clean up automatically when the component is destroyed.\r\n2. They are able to target specific directives, whereas existing APIs apply to all directives at the same time which might not be desirable in some cases.\r\n3. The new APIs are tree-shakeable so their code won't make it into the bundle unless you're actually using it, whereas existing APIs like `setInput` are defined as method that cannot be deleted.\r\n4.

When placing debugger statements in our code the browser just points at the end of the component template. This is not a problem when AOT is enabled.\n\nI noticed after some debugging that disabling the Angular CLI cache resolves the problem. Running `ng cache clean` or removing the `.angular` directory and restarting the dev server (with caching) does not help. Caching needs to be completely disabled for sourcemaps to work.\n\n**Caching enabled:**\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df9a33b4-d0d1-4347-aa7e-7ad47a3ec0a2\" />\n\n\n**Caching disabled:**\n\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126bbea4-0318-4a96-95fa-c790d8a3df73\" />\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/urrang/ng19-sourcemap-repro\n\nCommand: `ng serve`\n\nThe repro app has a debugger statement in the button's click handler. On the main branch the problem should be reproducible. On the cache-disabled branch CLI's cache has been disabled and the debugger should work as expected.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.8\n@angular/cli                    19.1.8\n@schematics/angular             19.1.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29697","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing component sourcemaps with JIT and CLI cache enabled\" (#29697)"},{"Id":"2870535922","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-23T14:40:53","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29693","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency rxjs to v7.8.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/reactivex/rxjs)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.8.1` -> `7.8.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rxjs/7.8.1/7.8.2) |\n| [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/reactivex/rxjs)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.8.1` -> `7.8.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rxjs/7.8.1/7.8.2) |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

The exact savings depends on the repository in question.\n    -   use Scorecard library entrypoint instead of Cobra hooking by [@&#8203;spencerschrock](https://redirect.github.com/spencerschrock) in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1423](https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1423)\n-   Some errors were made into annotations to make them more visible\n    -   Make default branch error more prominent by [@&#8203;jsoref](https://redirect.github.com/jsoref) in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1459](https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1459)\n-   There is now an optional `file_mode` input which controls how repository files are fetched from GitHub. The default is `archive`, but `git` produces the most accurate results for repositories with `.gitattributes` files at the cost of analysis speed.\n    -   add input for specifying `--file-mode` by [@&#8203;spencerschrock](https://redirect.github.com/spencerschrock) in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1509](https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1509)\n-   The underlying container for the action is now [hosted on GitHub Container Registry](https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pkgs/container/scorecard-action).

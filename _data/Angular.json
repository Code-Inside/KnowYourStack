{"Data":{"Angular-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1718623792","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T20:04:19","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"50399","RawContent":null,"Title":"Research lazy loading of Animations package code","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nanimations\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: this is an item that needs research/prototype, there is no guarantee that the solution described in this ticket would work.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in order to enable animations in a project, you can use the `provideAnimations()` function. The function brings the necessary providers and as a result, the code is included eagerly (the code gets added to the main bundle). However, in vast majority of cases, animations happen on user interaction and animations code is not needed immediately on page load. It'd be beneficial for initial page load if animations code can be deferred and be loaded asynchronously (i.e. code is excluded from the main bundle). There is also a related issue #20002, which talks about `NoopAnimationsModule` bringing a lot of code too. There is a chance that with some refactoring we can drop direct references to symbols that represent animation providers (instead, making them tree-shakable), so the size of the `NoopAnimationsModule` may go down.\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to explore a solution like this:\r\n\r\n- we can consider adding a new function (like `provideAnimationsAsync`)\r\n- the function would register a renderer (similar to how it works today), but the renderer would have the following logic:\r\n  - by default it delegates to the currently configured renderer\r\n  - if there is a component that has animations metadata (this info should be available at runtime) being initialized, start loading animations code (via dynamic import). We could consider doing it within `requestIdleCallback`.\r\n  - once the code is loaded, route calls to that loaded renderer (instead of delegating to the parent renderer)\r\n- this change would also require making `SHARED_ANIMATIONS_PROVIDERS` ([here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/animations/src/providers.ts#L43)) tree-shakable, so that there are no direct references to the symbols that bring a lot of code alongside with them. This item could also improve tree-shaking for the `NoopAnimationsModule` (which shouldn't reference those symbols, hence they should be tree-shaken away). This is probably the first item to look at, because if it's not feasible, other improvements describe above would bring only minor benefits (and may not worth adding extra complexity).\r\n\r\nNote: the described approach is not entirely new in the codebase, we perform a similar lazy-loading for Hammer library, [see here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/events/hammer_gestures.ts#L164). However, dynamic renderer delegation is something that we'd need to explore (there are no examples in the codebase).\r\n\r\n// cc @jessicajaniuk @JeanMeche in case you have some thoughts on this","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50399","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Research lazy loading of Animations package code\" (#50399)"},{"Id":"1718612163","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T19:19:15","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50398","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: improve AOT docs.","State":"open","Body":"Since v15, `protected` class member can be used in templates, Inputs & Outputs.\r\n\r\nOther Decorated class members, like @HostBindings or Children queries can be private.\r\n\r\nFixes #27467","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50398","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: improve AOT docs.\" (#50398)"},{"Id":"1718554666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T16:06:41","Actor":"shavidze","Number":"50397","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix code-example header path in dependency-injection-in-action-md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Also consider checking with the library's authors to see if the library is expected to be compatible with Ivy.\r\n\r\n3 export declare class OneiamModule {\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 12.2.18\r\nNode: 12.22.12\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.16\r\nOS: darwin x64\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nthe library project uses Webpack to build.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25244","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\" (#25244)"},{"Id":"1716456807","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-19T00:59:13","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25243","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: minor cleanup of bazel build rules","State":"open","Body":"BUILD files for each package have had outdated glob excludes removed.

If the folder is not present, it will use the declaration files that come with the TypeScript compiler (`/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts`).\r\n\r\nWhen I execute the `ng update` command, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n✔ Packages successfully installed.\r\nUsing package manager: npm\r\nCollecting installed dependencies...\r\nFound 16 dependencies.\r\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\r\n✖ Migration failed: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n  See \".../angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the Angular CLI is trying to fetch `@typescript/lib-dom` but this is not the name of the package, the correct name to fetch is `@types/web`.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have created the following repository that reproduces the issue. \r\n\r\nYou don't need to clone it, you can follow the steps explained in the `README.md`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jordimarimon/angular-cli-update-issue\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] HttpErrorGeneral: 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@typescript%2flib-dom - Not found\r\n    at /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/npm-registry-fetch/lib/check-response.js:95:15\r\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)\r\n    at async RegistryFetcher.packument (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/pacote/lib/registry.js:87:19)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 3)\r\n    at async /tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/update/schematic/index.js:671:36\r\n    at async callRuleAsync (/tmp/angular-cli-packages-Fv6UlW/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/rules/call.js:77:18)\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.2.8\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25224","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`ng update` not resolving the correct NPM package when using `npm:<name>` syntax as version range\" (#25224)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1718503490","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T19:39:28","Actor":"Naaajii","Number":"27134","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): missing positionAtOrigin documentation","State":"closed","Body":"add description for Input('matTooltipPositionAtOrigin')\r\n\r\nfixes #26078","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27134","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tooltip): missing positionAtOrigin documentation\" (#27134)"},{"Id":"1718535410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T15:03:19","Actor":"Naaajii","Number":"27135","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): description for disableRipple","State":"open","Body":"prior this commit on properties table disableRipple had no description showing table cell to be empty","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27135","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material/list): description for disableRipple\" (#27135)"},{"Id":"1715345692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T13:14:18","Actor":"Naaajii","Number":"27117","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): missing positionAtOrigin documentation","State":"closed","Body":"adds description for @Input('matTooltipPositionAtOrigin')\r\n\r\nfixes #26078","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27117","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tooltip): missing positionAtOrigin documentation\" (#27117)"},{"Id":"1718491454","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-21T12:46:49","Actor":"amirheydari9","Number":"27133","RawContent":null,"Title":"jalali calendar","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThe Jalali Angular Material calendar does not work properly and we have to use side packages that are usually compatible with older versions of Angular and we cannot fully use the new features of Angular in our project.

If the corresponding button has the standard-height of `48px` than this is fine. With reducing e.g. the `denisity` the `48px` shrink to e.g. `36px`.

Click on the chip focuses it and doesn't have any other side effects. To begin editing the chip, the user can either press enter or double click on it. Since htis is a butotn interaciton, I would expect enter and click to perform the action of the button. Since click and enter are not consistent, that means that the editable chip doesn't conform to the ARIA button interaciton pattern.\r\n\r\nDouble click is generally not available to Screen Readers and Assistive Technology.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

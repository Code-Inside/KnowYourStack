Hopefully everything is working after this release. I plan to change all platform-specific package names to use the `@esbuild/` scope at some point to avoid this problem in the future.\n\n### [`v0.14.52`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01452)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.51...v0.14.52)\n\n-   Allow binary data as input to the JS `transform` and `build` APIs ([#&#8203;2424](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2424))\n\n    Previously esbuild's `transform` and `build` APIs could only take a string. However, some people want to use esbuild to convert binary data to base64 text. This is problematic because JavaScript strings represent UTF-16 text and esbuild internally operates on arrays of bytes, so all strings coming from JavaScript undergo UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion before use. This meant that using esbuild in this way was doing base64 encoding of the UTF-8 encoding of the text, which was undesired.\n\n    With this release, esbuild now accepts `Uint8Array` in addition to string as an input format for the `transform` and `build` APIs. Now you can use esbuild to convert binary data to base64 text:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import esbuild from 'esbuild'\n    console.log([\n      (await esbuild.transform('\\xFF', { loader: 'base64' })).code,\n      (await esbuild.build({ stdin: { contents: '\\xFF', loader: 'base64' }, write: false })).outputFiles[0].text,\n    ])\n    console.log([\n      (await esbuild.transform(new Uint8Array([0xFF]), { loader: 'base64' })).code,\n      (await esbuild.build({ stdin: { contents: new Uint8Array([0xFF]), loader: 'base64' }, write: false })).outputFiles[0].text,\n    ])\n\n    // Old output\n    [ 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n' ]\n    /* ERROR: The input to \"transform\" must be a string */\n\n    // New output\n    [ 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"w78=\";\\n' ]\n    [ 'module.exports = \"/w==\";\\n', 'module.exports = \"/w==\";\\n' ]\n    ```\n\n-   Update the getter for `text` in build results ([#&#8203;2423](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2423))\n\n    Output files in build results returned from esbuild's JavaScript API have both a `contents` and a `text` property to return the contents of the output file. The `contents` property is a binary UTF-8 Uint8Array and the `text` property is a JavaScript UTF-16 string. The `text` property is a getter that does the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion only if it's needed for better performance.\n\n    Previously if you mutate the build results object, you had to overwrite both `contents` and `text` since the value returned from the `text` getter is the original text returned by esbuild. Some people find this confusing so with this release, the getter for `text` has been updated to do the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion on the current value of the `contents` property instead of the original value.\n\n-   Publish builds for Linux LoongArch 64-bit ([#&#8203;1804](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1804), [#&#8203;2373](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2373))\n\n    This release upgrades to [Go 1.19](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19), which now includes support for LoongArch 64-bit processors. LoongArch 64-bit builds of esbuild will now be published to npm, which means that in theory they can now be installed with `npm install esbuild`.

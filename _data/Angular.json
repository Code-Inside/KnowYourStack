Through the redirection\r\n  of `main` field in `package.json`, it resolves to\r\n  `./bundles/language-service.js`.\r\n- `@angular/language-service/bundles/ivy.js`\r\n  This secondary entry point is for Ivy LS.\r\n\r\nTypeScript recently changed the behavior of tsserver to allow only package\r\nnames as plugin names [1] for security reasons. This means the secondary\r\nentry point for Ivy LS can no longer be used.\r\nWe implemented a quick [hack](https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/pull/1111) in the module resolver (in the extension repo)\r\nto fix this, but the long term fix should be in `@angular/language-service`.\r\n\r\nHere, the `main` field in `package.json` is changed to `index.js`, and in the\r\nindex file we conditionally load View Engine or Ivy based on the input config.\r\nThis eliminates the need for multiple entry points.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR, I also removed all source code for View Engine and Ivy\r\nincluded in the NPM package.

I have not touched any aspect of the usage of these plugins in my code for the past two months, and have not had any unusual Visual Studio Code errors pop up, until now.  I've started to see the following error appear in both the .ts and .html file of the affected components:\r\n\r\n\"**This component uses a directive which requires an inline type constructor, which is not supported by the current environment. (-998901)**\"\r\n\r\nI pinpointed it down to the imask directive I use for my input field (assume **moneyMask** is a valid mask object that has not been changed for the past two months):\r\n\r\n`<input type=\"text\"\r\n              id=\"someId\"\r\n              name=\"someName\"\r\n              ...\r\n              [imask]=\"moneyMask\"\r\n              [unmask]=\"true\"\r\n              >`\r\n\r\nIf I were to remove the [imask] and [unmask] directives from my input tag, the VSC error goes away for both the affected .ts and .html component files.  But now I have effectively eliminated masking from my input fields.\r\n\r\n**Important:** While this error does appear in VSC, I get **no issues** after running ng lint (I am using ESLint instead of TSLint), and my project both runs fine locally via ng serve and can built without any errors too.  So this seems to be centralized with Visual Studio Code and the Angular Language Service, but I know at some point my development team is going to be asking questions soon about this and it could affect any other directive-based plugins I choose to use in my projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.2.1\r\nNode: 12.20.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1102.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1102.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    11.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    11.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             11.2.1\r\n@schematics/update              0.1102.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.1.5\r\n\r\nRunning Visual Studio Code version 1.53.2.\r\nAngular Language Service Extension running version 11.2.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 11.2+ language service error for inline type constructor not supported by current environment (-998901)\" (#40963)"},{"Id":"814291114","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T14:09:04","Actor":"harleenarora","Number":"40961","RawContent":null,"Title":"ANGULAR 11 some items return error Cannot read property 'provide' of undefined","State":"closed","Body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nI have export all service files in one index.ts and import is component and module like that::\r\n\r\n`import { IpAddressServ, LoadrServ, PageTitleServ } from './Services';`\r\n\r\nSome time return error::\r\n\r\n```\r\n`core.js:6150 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'provide' of undefined\r\nat resolveProvider$1 (core.js:20883)\r\nat resolveProvider$1 (core.js:20877)\r\nat providersResolver (core.js:20864)\r\nat Object.definition.providersResolver (core.js:21111)\r\nat instantiateRootComponent (core.js:10071)\r\nat createRootComponent (core.js:12389)\r\nat ComponentFactory$1.create (core.js:25072)\r\nat ViewContainerRef.createComponent (core.js:23112)`\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40961","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ANGULAR 11 some items return error Cannot read property 'provide' of undefined\" (#40961)"},{"Id":"814486404","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T13:54:49","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"40962","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(zone.js): remove onProp eventName array to reduce bundle size","State":"open","Body":"Zone.js supports google closure compiler in advance optimization mode,\r\nto prevent closure compiler modify the `onProperty` name such as `Element.prototype.onclick`,\r\nZone.js implements the `onProperty` patch logic by declaring all the\r\nevent names in source code, this increases the bundle size and also require\r\nupdating the event names array to keep the information updated.\r\n\r\nNow google closure compiler has the required event names defined in the built-in\r\nexterns files, so zone.js can use more simple implementation and decrease the bundle size\r\nof zone.js.

However, if the name is NOT unique, Angular will not complain and simply use one (the last one?) of the NgModels, displaying the same value to the user everywhere even if there are multiple NgModels with different values.\r\n\r\nFor example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-lichgx?file=src/app/app.component.html\r\n\r\nThis has been a problem for us when we create forms dynamically and must take great care to make sure all names are unique.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be very helpful if Angular would show a warning or throw an error/exception if \"name\" is not unique within a form. \r\n\r\nFor example: If \"name\" is missing, TemplateDrivenErrors.missingNameException() shows a helpful Error. It would be great if there was an TemplateDrivenErrors.nameNotUniqueException().\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nOur current workaround is to generate globally unique names for all our NgModels, but we must remember to use them everytime we add a new NgModel.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40960","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Show warning/error if NgModel.name is not unique in form\" (#40960)"},{"Id":"814133789","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T05:48:39","Actor":"solos","Number":"40958","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(common): add params percent encoding encoder","State":"open","Body":"Previously, if a http param's value contains reserved characters such as\r\n\";\", the value is not encoded correctly.

For example, if\r\nthe selector of a directive is changed then all components that have\r\nthat directive in their compilation scope need to be recompiled, as the\r\nchange of selector may affect the directive matching results.\r\n\r\nUntil now, the compiler solved this problem using a single dependency\r\ngraph. The implicit NgModule dependencies were represented in this\r\ngraph, such that a changed file would correctly also cause other files\r\nto be re-emitted. This approach is limited in a few ways:\r\n\r\n1. The file dependency graph is used to determine whether it is safe to\r\n   reuse the analysis data of an Angular decorated class. This analysis\r\n   data is invariant to unrelated changes to the NgModule scope, but\r\n   because the single dependency graph also tracked the implicit\r\n   NgModule dependencies the compiler had to consider analysis data as\r\n   stale far more often than necessary.\r\n2. It is typical for a change to e.g. a directive to not affect its\r\n   public API—its selector, inputs, outputs, or exportAs clause—in which\r\n   case there is no need to re-emit all declarations in scope, as their\r\n   compilation output wouldn't have changed.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements a mechanism by which the compiler is able to\r\ndetermine the impact of a change by comparing it to the prior\r\ncompilation. To achieve this, a new graph is maintained that tracks all\r\npublic API information of all Angular decorated symbols. During an\r\nincremental compilation this information is compared to the information\r\nthat was captured in the most recently succeeded compilation. This\r\ndetermines the exact impact of the changes to the public API, which\r\nis then used to determine which files need to be re-emitted.\r\n\r\nNote that the file dependency graph remains, as it is still used to\r\ntrack the dependencies of analysis data. This graph does no longer track\r\nthe implicit NgModule dependencies, which allows for better reuse of\r\nanalysis data.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes an incorrectness where a change to a declaration\r\nin NgModule `A` would not cause the declarations in NgModules that\r\nimport from NgModule `A` to be re-emitted. This was intentionally\r\nincorrect as otherwise the performance of incremental rebuilds would\r\nhave been far worse. This is no longer a concern, as the compiler is now\r\nable to only re-emit when actually necessary.\r\n\r\nFixes #34867\r\nFixes #40635\r\nCloses #40728","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40947","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(compiler-cli): detect semantic changes and their effect on an incremental rebuilds\" (#40947)"},{"Id":"813793610","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-22T19:26:19","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"40945","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): improve the layout/appearance of the \"Press kit\" page","State":"open","Body":"_**NOTE:**_\r\n_Along with #40427, #40704, #40802, #40881 and #40944, this PR concludes the effort to clean up and bring in the changes from #36045.

  Allows to generate relative URLs from `new URL` (e. g. for SSG/SSR)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fixes for electron target\n    -   electron has importScripts in worker\n    -   only choose a chunkLoading which fits to the chunkFormat\n    -   prefer fetch wasm loading over node wasm loading\n-   fix regression when combining library + runtimeChunk + node target\n\n### Developer Experience\n\n-   export MultiStats type\n\n### [`v5.22.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.22.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.21.2...v5.22.0)\n\n### Features\n\n-   generate shorter output code for JSON data by using a `'...'` string instead of `\"...\"` (only affects output side when not minimized)\n-   the `dependencies` configuration option now works for watch builds too\n    -   It will build compilation when any of `dependencies` has changed\n    -   It will wait for compiling until all of `dependencies` have finished\n-   add `parallelism` config option on the array of configurations to limit the compilers that are running in parallel\n\n### Developer Experience\n\n-   add hints (`Did you mean ...`) to resolve errors when\n    -   resolving fails due to `enforceExtension`\n    -   relative request is missing leading `./`\n-   when all modules of an entrypoint fail resolving and another entrypoints `depend(s)On` it, webpack no longer crashes with a weird error\n-   add hint to stats how to get details about errors/warnings in child compilations\n-   improve error message for lazyCompilation when using IE11\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   async entries e.g. for Workers are now implicitly flagged as \"having side effects\" even if they are affects by `\"sideEffects\": false`\n    -   in future we might add a warning for this\n-   avoid crash when using `this.loadModule` (loader) and the loaded module has errors\n-   refactor libraries to inline exporting code into runtime to allow using with `output.iife: false`\n-   fix invalid code when using `define` for local modules and arrow functions are supported\n-   fix missing runtime requirement for system.js context\n-   fix parsing of `define` function, which missed declarations before\n-   avoid unnecessary calls to loaders when serializer are already registered\n-   fix inner graph analysis for exports when `export { x }` is before pure declaration `const x = /*#__PURE__*/ f()`\n-   fix hashing order of runtime chunks when there are async entries involved\n\n### Contribution\n\n-   CI run tests on node.js 15 too\n-   CI run tests on github actions too\n\n### Experiments\n\n-   improvements on experimental `output.library: { type: \"module\" }` (`experiments.outputModule: true`)\n    -   it can generate `export { ... }` now, but that can't handle live-bindings yet\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Having said that, I merely copied & pasted the code of my simple example app to stackblitz & it doesn't render properly there either.\r\n\r\nIn SharePoint, sometimes I get a 404 error, but not always:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78363807/108604809-2217f100-737e-11eb-8e69-9b24d87dc295.png)\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.0.14\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 88.0.4324.182 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.8\r\nNode: 13.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.8\r\n@angular/cdk                      10.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.8\r\n@angular/material                 10.2.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.8\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.8\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.9\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21973","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-form-field): mat-form-field inputs not rendering properly when deployed\" (#21973)"},{"Id":"813534221","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-22T15:59:16","Actor":"Razgort","Number":"21977","RawContent":null,"Title":"MatDialog: capacity AppendTo like native dialog","State":"closed","Body":"Hello guys,\r\n\r\nSorry to bother you here, but we are facing an issue in our dev team.\r\nWe have a div that can be displayed as a full screen container by the navigator.

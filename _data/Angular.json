I can't reproduce this in StackBlitz after saving ~20 times.\n\n1. Install a new Angular project using the defaults.\n2. Run `ng serve`\n3. Change `app.component.html` to `<p><strong>foo</strong></p>`\n4. Save and watch the dev server reload the page\n5. Change `app.component.html` to `<p>foo</strong></p>`. Save.\n6. Change `app.component.html` to `<p><strong>foo</strong></p>`. Save.\n7. See the error in the browser `ɵgetOrCreateAngularServerApp is not a function`, if it reloads properly, repeat steps 5 and 6 a few times until it doesn't reload.\n\n## Video\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f727797f-721c-4132-bb21-c7f6e7ca4c0c\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nTypeError: ɵgetOrCreateAngularServerApp is not a function\n    at _AngularAppEngine.eval (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/cache/19.2.4/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/vite/deps_ssr/chunk-J6AJWQHP.js:11513:25)\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\n    at fulfilled (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/cache/19.2.4/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/vite/deps_ssr/chunk-YHCV7DAQ.js:72:24)\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invoke (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:369:28)\n    at ZoneImpl.run (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:111:43)\n    at eval (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:1221:40)\n    at _ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:402:33)\n    at ZoneImpl.runTask (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:159:47)\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (/home/exac/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/.angular/vite-root/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function/node_modules/zone.js/fesm2015/zone-node.js:581:35)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nexac@DESKTOP-58AJUTF:~/WebstormProjects/get-or-create-angular-server-app-is-not-a-function$ ng version\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.4\nNode: 20.18.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.3\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.4\n@angular/cli                    19.2.4\n@angular/ssr                    19.2.4\n@schematics/angular             19.2.4\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dev server stops updating if the user saves while the HTML is in an invalid state\" (#29907)"},{"Id":"2937554870","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T13:59:49","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29908","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): handle undefined `getOrCreateAngularServerApp` during error compilation","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nEnhanced error handling to account for cases where `getOrCreateAngularServerApp` is undefined during the compilation process.

This is expected for proper code splitting, and also for our upcoming `rules_js` migration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this highlights an issue with the Angular compiler. We occasionally re-export other entry-point modules from one entry-point module. This is likely done for convenience, but we should stop doing that going forward (and likely will naturally resolve this over time with standalone either way).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the Angular compiler, especially with HMR enabled (i.e. no tree-shaking of imports), will try to generate imports in the user code to symbols that are indirectly re-exported. This worked before because the Angular compiler leveraged the \"best guessed module\", based on the \"last module import\" it saw before e.g. discovering the re-exported `ScrollingModule`; hence it assumed all exports of that module are available from `@angular/cdk/scrolling`. This assumption no longer works because the last module import would be e.g. `cdk/overlay`, which relatively imports from scrolling to re-export the module then.\r\n\r\nThere are a few options:\r\n\r\n- teach the compiler about relative imports inside APF packages with secondary entry-points. Possible, but won't work for users with older compiler versions. Maybe a long-term good thing to do; on the other hand, standalone is the new future.\r\n\r\n- switch back to module imports. Not possible and relative imports should work inside a package IMO.\r\n\r\n- re-export the exposed symbols, under a private name. This is the easiest approach and there also aren't a lot of module re-exports; so this is a viable approach taken by this commit.\r\n\r\nFixes #30663.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30667","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): ensure re-exported module symbols can be imported\" (#30667)"},{"Id":"2935578679","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T15:55:12","Actor":"grichards23","Number":"30669","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE TS-993004: Unable to import directive Dir.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n19.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nAfter updating my npm packages today, seems there is an issue with the Dir directive, which I'm not even leveraging explicitly.\n\nHave virtual scrolling implemented in a number of components in our application.\nAfter upgrading to @angular/cdk 19.2.4, all those components are reporting import issues with the above directive while running the development server (ng serve)\n\nI've attempted to also import the BidiModule to see if that would clear the errors in the console and it does not.\n\n---------\n\n[ERROR] TS-993004: Unable to import directive Dir.\n  The symbol is not exported from C:/....../node_modules/@angular/cdk/scrolling/index.d.ts (module '@angular/cdk/scrolling').

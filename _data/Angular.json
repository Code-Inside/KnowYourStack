guide more generic","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe current guide for structural directive (https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives) is titled \"Writing structural directives\" and revolves around the topic of custom structural directives, in the guide there are also generic structural-directive sections such as [Structural Directive Shorthand](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#structural-directive-shorthand) and [Structural Directive Syntax](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#structural-directive-syntax-reference), but the main focus of the page seems not to be to give a generic explanation of structural directives.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThis should be changed so that this page can be a generic point of reference for structural directives (it actually is already linked in various places as the structural directives guide) and it should have a more generic approach than the current one, describing both generic structural-directive information alongside how to create custom ones.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIt should probably not go much into detail regarding built-in ones as they are already covered here: https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#built-in-structural-directives (of course the page should include a link to this section).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIt also needs to specify clearly that only a single structural directive can be used per element (a fact that is not currently clearly covered in the aio guides).\r\n\r\nAfter adding such section we need to make sure to update all the links pointing to the \"unclear\" explanation (https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#one-per-element) to the

The test passes even before the fix because the `ngc` binary and end-to-end tests [don't request diagnostics unless the configuration is considered valid](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ed21f5c75378e1ce717ee3d76d28c8c994209de1/packages/compiler-cli/src/perform_compile.ts#L292-L293).

In that situation, it might be the case that the chunk of code they are trying to load is no longer present.\r\n\r\nWorking against this is that, while some code was deployed on the day the error below was reported, no changes at all were made to the angular front end that day--it would have recompiled as part of the deploy, but I'm not sure any of the filenames would have changed.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause of the chunk failing to load, it seems that there could be some more graceful way to handle such failures.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel</summary>\n\n### [`v7.16.11`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/releases/v7.16.11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.16.10...v7.16.11)\n\n#### v7.16.11 (2022-01-20)\n\nThis empty releases force-publishes a new version of `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods` (which was not published in v7.16.10 because it didn't have any actual change) and of `@babel/preset-env`.\n\nThis solves [an incompatibility](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/pull/14169#issuecomment-1016948723) between `@babel/preset-env@7.16.10` and `@babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin@7.16.7`, by making sure that `@babel/preset-env` transitively depends on `@babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin@^7.16.10`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v10.2.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1021-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribcopy-webpack-plugincomparev1020v1021-2022-01-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/compare/v10.2.0...v10.2.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.12`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01412)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.11...v0.14.12)\n\n-   Ignore invalid `@import` rules in CSS ([#&#8203;1946](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1946))\n\n    In CSS, `@import` rules must come first before any other kind of rule (except for `@charset` rules). Previously esbuild would warn about incorrectly ordered `@import` rules and then hoist them to the top of the file. This broke people who wrote invalid `@import` rules in the middle of their files and then relied on them being ignored. With this release, esbuild will now ignore invalid `@import` rules and pass them through unmodified. This more accurately follows the CSS specification. Note that this behavior differs from other tools like Parcel, which does hoist CSS `@import` rules.\n\n-   Print invalid CSS differently ([#&#8203;1947](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1947))\n\n    This changes how esbuild prints nested `@import` statements that are missing a trailing `;`, which is invalid CSS. The result is still partially invalid CSS, but now printed in a better-looking way:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .bad { @&#8203;import url(\"other\") }\n    .red { background: red; }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    .bad{@&#8203;import url(other) } .red{background: red;}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    .bad{@&#8203;import url(other);}.red{background:red}\n    ```\n\n-   Warn about CSS nesting syntax ([#&#8203;1945](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1945))\n\n    There's a proposed [CSS syntax for nesting rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/) using the `&` selector, but it's not currently implemented in any browser. Previously esbuild silently passed the syntax through untransformed. With this release, esbuild will now warn when you use nesting syntax with a `--target=` setting that includes a browser.\n\n-   Warn about `}` and `>` inside JSX elements\n\n    The `}` and `>` characters are invalid inside JSX elements according to [the JSX specification](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) because they commonly result from typos like these that are hard to catch in code reviews:\n\n    ```jsx\n    function F() {\n      return <div>></div>;\n    }\n    function G() {\n      return <div>{1}}</div>;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The TypeScript compiler already [treats this as an error](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36341), so esbuild now treats this as an error in TypeScript files too. That looks like this:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] The character \">\" is not valid inside a JSX element\n\n            example.tsx:2:14:\n              2 │   return <div>></div>;\n                │               ^\n                ╵               {'>'}\n\n          Did you mean to escape it as \"{'>'}\" instead?\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] The character \"}\" is not valid inside a JSX element\n\n            example.tsx:5:17:\n              5 │   return <div>{1}}</div>;\n                │                  ^\n                ╵                  {'}'}\n\n          Did you mean to escape it as \"{'}'}\" instead?\n\n    Babel doesn't yet treat this as an error, so esbuild only warns about these characters in JavaScript files for now. Babel 8 [treats this as an error](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/issues/11042) but Babel 8 [hasn't been released yet](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/issues/10746). If you see this warning, I recommend fixing the invalid JSX syntax because it will become an error in the future.\n\n-   Warn about basic CSS property typos\n\n    This release now generates a warning if you use a CSS property that is one character off from a known CSS property:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] \"marign-left\" is not a known CSS property\n\n            example.css:2:2:\n              2 │   marign-left: 12px;\n                │   ~~~~~~~~~~~\n                ╵   margin-left\n\n          Did you mean \"margin-left\" instead?\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>browserify/resolve</summary>\n\n### [`v1.21.1`](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.0...v1.21.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/browserify/resolve/compare/v1.21.0...v1.21.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

There are no build errors in the console, and weirdly after a few incremental rebuilds the problem fixes itself. After some digging I found the root cause was this PR: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22239 If I disable the `NamedChunksPlugin` in the webpack config, then the problem goes away and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproducing this outside of our app is hard. If you're willing to sign an NDA I can just give you access to the repo to debug it yourselves, or if you can give me some instructions on how to debug it my end to find the root cause I'm also happy to do that.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c failed.\r\n(error: http://localhost:4200/default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c.js)\r\nChunkLoadError: Loading chunk default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c failed.\r\n(error: http://localhost:4200/default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c.js)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.15\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.3\r\n@angular/google-maps            12.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.3\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Now we cannot, or the option changed and it is nowhere told how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nScenario is very simple. Application has 15+ languages and I need to serve a specific language, in my example: German. I can't anymore because it says that this is not a valid option.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate an application with two locales and try to launch the one which is not set as default. It seems it's not possible anymore.\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible using this command: `ng serve --configuration=de`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"i18nFile\": \"src/i18n/messages.de.xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nLocale\": \"de\" <-- ERROR since v13\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"browserTarget\": \"frontend:build:de\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre>Data path \"\" must NOT have additional properties(i18nFile)<code>\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBuild fails and application is not served. Since I see squiggly lines over all three options it is clear that all of them are not valid anymore.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1301.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

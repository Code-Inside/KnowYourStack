Not as part of the initial change detection cycle\n2. Inside of a component (later referenced as \"child component\") that uses OnPush change detection \n3. ...which lives inside a parent component that uses the default change detection.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-xnch5wpq?file=src%2Fapp%2Fparent.comoponent.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fchild.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fdata.directive.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nAngular is not refreshing an embedded view even though there are signals in the template that have updated values.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nNot sure how to get this from stackblitz, but here is the relevant package.json:\n\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"^7.8.2\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.8.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.8.3\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"^22.7.2\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^6.0.2\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"^10.9.2\"\n  },\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSorry if this has already been reported, but was not able to find any similar issues.\n\nI have tried to mimize the setup for the bug, but here are a couple of things that make the bug _not_ appear: \n* The parent component uses OnPush change detection\n  * However this is not possible on our legacy apps\n* The child component uses the default change detection\n  * This would reduce performance\n* Triggering mark for check or detect changes on the embedded view after it has been created\n  * Causes unnecessary change detection cycles, the template will be rendered twice\n\nIn the stackblitz I have used the ng.ɵgetSignalGraph on ngDoCheck and ngAfterViewChecked on both the parent and child component. One can then see that the signal graph does not update correctly when the bug occurs. The embedded view is initally added as a node to the _parent_ component with the signal as a dependency, but then the signal dependency is removed on the next change detection cycle.\n\nFurthermore, setting a breakboint during the rendering of the embedded view, one gets this result:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9acc225a-cb95-48c4-b52e-1ac9e9240f0f)\n\nThe `refreshView` function is where the active consumer can be set. If its a component the `viewShouldHaveReactiveConsumer` returns true and sets that component as the active consumer. If not it makes a check if there is already an active consumer, and if not it creates a temporary one that gets added to the current lView later on:\n```ts\n  // part of refreshView before executing templates\n  let context = null;\n  if (viewShouldHaveReactiveConsumer(tView)) {\n    currentConsumer = getOrBorrowReactiveLViewConsumer(lView);\n    prevConsumer = consumerBeforeComputation(currentConsumer);\n  } else if (getActiveConsumer() === null) {\n    // If the current view should not have a reactive consumer but we don't have an active consumer,\n    // we still need to create a temporary consumer to track any signal reads in this template.\n    // This is a rare case that can happen with `viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(...).detectChanges()`.\n    // This temporary consumer marks the first parent that _should_ have a consumer for refresh.\n    // Once that refresh happens, the signals will be tracked in the parent consumer and we can destroy\n    // the temporary one.\n    returnConsumerToPool = false;\n    currentConsumer = getOrCreateTemporaryConsumer(lView);\n    prevConsumer = consumerBeforeComputation(currentConsumer);\n  }\n  ...\n  executeTemplate(tView, lView, templateFn, RenderFlags.Update, context);\n```\n\nAlso relvant code from `detectChangesInView` :\n```ts\n  // part of detectChangesInView\n  if (shouldRefreshView) {\n    refreshView(tView, lView, tView.template, lView[CONTEXT]);\n  } else if (flags & LViewFlags.HasChildViewsToRefresh) {\n    ...\n    detectChangesInEmbeddedViews(lView, ChangeDetectionMode.Targeted);\n    ...\n  }\n```\n\nThen breaking up the timeline, it goes something like this:\n\n* The app is initialized, and the parent, child and the structual directive is created.\n* Some time later the embedded view is created, and on attach runs `markAncestorsForTraversal` on the corresponding lView, and triggering change detection (see the picture of the stacktrace to follow along):\n  1. Runs `detectChangesInView` with root, enters `refreshView` and sets root as active consumer\n  2. Runs `detectChangesInView` with parent component, enters `refreshView` and sets parent component as active consumer\n  3. Runs `detectChangesInView` with child component, does _not_ enter `refreshView` and because of this does _not_ set it as the active consumer. However, It has  been marked with `HasChildViewsToRefresh` (because of the creation of the embedded view) and triggers change detection in its children.\n  4. Runs detectChangesInView on the embedded view, entering `refreshView` (first time it is created). Because it is not a component it does not run `getOrBorrowReactiveLViewConsumer`. There is already an active consumer (the parent component) so it does not hit the `getOrCreateTemporaryConsumer` function either.  No consumer is set, so the root component is still the active consumer\n  5. Because the template relies on a signal, and the active consumer is the parent component, the parent component is added as a live dependency of that signal\n\n* The signal changes value:\n  1. This causes the signal to run `markAncestorsForTraversal` on the _parent_ component\n  2. Runs `detectChangesInView` with root, enters `refreshView`\n  3. Runs `detectChangesInView` with parent component, enters `refreshView` \n  4. Runs `detectChangesInView` with child component, but the component is neither refreshed or has the flag `HasChildViewsToRefresh`, thus skips change detection of this component and the embedded view\n  5. The parent component is then removed as a live consumer of the signal because the signal was not called during this change detection cycle\n\n* The signal changes value again:\n  1. Nothing happens because it has no live consumer\n\nNote: If one stops det debugger at the `refreshView` function of the embedded view and the runs the code as if `getActiveConsumer()` returns null the embedded view will update when the signal changes. This is what happens when the parent component uses OnPush change detection.\n\n\nI have also created a fork of Angular where I have added a unit tests which now fails: [link to repo](https://github.com/angular/angular/compare/main...kristilw:angular-bug:bug-change-detection)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61662","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Template with signal not updating when the value of the signal changes\" (#61662)"},{"Id":"3087368766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T19:41:31","Actor":"coder-ashwin","Number":"61661","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: Migration for ngClass and ngStyle to class and style","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nhttps://next.angular.dev/style-guide#prefer-class-and-style-over-ngclass-and-ngstyle\n\nWith the new style guide informing us to prefer class and style over ngClass and ngStyle, it does make sense and all our developers are now doing it for newer components.\n\nIt would also be great to have a migration which can change it for all the existing places.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61661","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: Migration for ngClass and ngStyle to class and style\" (#61661)"},{"Id":"3086908258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T18:48:37","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61651","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(common): Add circular deps test to 19.2.x","State":"closed","Body":"adds circular deps test for http client to 19.2.x branch\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61651","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(common): Add circular deps test to 19.2.x\" (#61651)"},{"Id":"3087234379","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T18:44:12","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61660","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(upgrade): Make zoneless work with hybrid apps","State":"open","Body":"Hybrid applications trigger a digest when `onMicrotaskEmpty` emits so that the AngularJS app can run its lifecycle when the Angular app does.

What I've observed is that when using `provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true })`, the same event handler on an `<input />` element is triggered both for `(keyup.enter)` and `(blur)`.\n\n```ts\n@if (!isEditMode()) {\n  <span (dblclick)=\"toggleEditMode()\" class=\"counter-text\"\n    >Current Count: <span class=\"counter-value\">{{ count() }}</span>\n  </span>\n} @else {\n  <input\n    type=\"number\"\n    [(ngModel)]=\"count\"\n    (blur)=\"toggleEditMode()\"\n    (keyup.enter)=\"toggleEditMode()\"\n    class=\"input w-32\"\n  />\n}\n\n// in toggleEditMode()\ntoggleEditMode() {\n  this.isEditMode.update((m) => !m);\n}\n```\n\nThis results in a situation where the `<input/>` will not be hidden and replaced by the `<span>` when I press enter.\n\nUpdate: It seems that zone-related config is not a contributing factor here, as using `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` also results in the same behavior. \n\nMaybe related to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57528\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fptmza6m?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nThe input element should be hidden after I press Enter.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.11\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.10.0\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.10\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.10\n@angular/cli                    19.2.11\n@schematics/angular             19.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIf `isEditMode` is a normal boolean variable, the interaction works fine.

Avoiding the need to load and parse a potentially large amount of code to perform the check can improve performance for the cases where no linking is required.

I made a script on the root monorepo level to run the script on all of the child applications. When I do this, it always seems to ADD a fake dependency to each of the app `package.json` files which is the name of that project\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOn the root level package I have this NPM script\n```\n\"update-angular-apps\": \"npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-1 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-2 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-3\",\n```\nAnd here is what the individual app package files look like\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"name-of-app-2\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"author\": \"Me\",\n  \"description\": \"My App #2\",\n  \"homepage\": \"https://company.com/app-2\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/redacted/app-2.git\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"update-angular\": \"ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material --allow-dirty\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint --fix --max-warnings=0\",\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.2.12\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"*\",\n    \"typescript\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the root level I run `npm run update-angular-apps` and it modifies the `package.json` files with all the correct updates, and then after a little bit of time it adds a fake package to `dependencies` as a final step.

All the components are self contained, meaning the <mat-form-field><mat-label><component><mat-error> are inside our custom component, while the form is outside.\nSo ever since the upgrade (jump from 14 to 19) specifically the mat-error does not show until specifically clicked on the input. Regardless of any programmatical approach and actually debugging and seeing the error is present and the hasError returning true, the mat-error won't show unless physically clicked on the input. Additionally, with Autocomplete, label stops the field from being focused. I tried debugging and figuring out what and how happens and it all looks like the binding process can't correctly discern when we have an \"additional layer\" between the form tag and mat-form-field and the binding process fails. \nThe NgValueAccessor and MatFormFieldControl are both implemented and I can clearly see correct states for determining error and other states, however, the error specifically is not applied. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAs in version 14, I expect ALL the mat-form-fields to work properly regardless of how far inside the form they are. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe fields partially work.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19\n- Browser(s): All chromium based\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows/Mac\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): Custom Autocomplete component doesn't bind properly on form and other mat components\" (#31205)"},{"Id":"3085176195","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T05:05:20","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31204","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency karma-jasmine-html-reporter to v2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`~1.7.0` -> `~2.1.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`^1.5.4` -> `^2.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter (karma-jasmine-html-reporter)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0)\n\n-   Add jasmine 5 as a compatible peer dependency\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0\n\n### [`v2.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v1.7.0...v2.0.0)\n\nThis version rewrites the package to use the peer jasmine-core package instead of repackaging the html reporting code.

Although, I'm not sure what other, if any, repercussions of that change would be.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31196","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-form-field): Support nested content projection for _formFieldControl\" (#31196)"},{"Id":"3083115553","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-22T11:54:17","Actor":"jeremyallebe","Number":"31195","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): export MatDatepickerBase in public-api.ts","State":"open","Body":"Export the MatDatepickerBase abstract class to allow extends of MatDatepicker.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31195","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): export MatDatepickerBase in public-api.ts\" (#31195)"},{"Id":"3082967318","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-22T10:58:55","Actor":"DywiTom","Number":"31194","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DragRef): 'released' event not firing if element wasn't moved","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAccording to the [DragRef documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/api#DragRef), the `released` event is described as:\n\n> \"Emits when the user has released a drag item, before any animations have started.\"\n\nHowever, this event is only emitted if the dragged element was actually moved.  \nIf I just press and release the mouse (i.e., `mousedown` followed by `mouseup`) without moving the element, the `released` event does **not** fire.\n\nInterestingly, the `beforeStarted` event **does** fire in this case — even though dragging never really began. This creates an inconsistent event lifecycle.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/dv56brss?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-drag-drop-overview-example.ts\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nClick element, see console.log.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth `beforeStarted` and `released` should behave consistently.  \nIf `beforeStarted` fires, `released` should follow on mouse release — even when the element hasn't been moved.\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. Attach listeners to both `beforeStarted` and `released` on a `DragRef`.\n2. Press (`mousedown`) on the element.\n3. Release (`mouseup`) without moving the pointer.\n4.

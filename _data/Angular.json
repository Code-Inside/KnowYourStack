similar way to DestroyRef","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nI had a case with dynamic forms  that rendered fields based on some conditions. ex: \n\n```html\n@if (condition1) {\n      <field1 />\n      <field2 />\n    }\n\n\n@if (condition2) {\n      <field1 />\n      <field3 />\n    }\n```\n\nand in the component.ts the form looks like this:\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n\n})\nexport class SampleComponent {\n\n  sampleForm = new FormGroup({\n     field1: new FormControl({disabled: true}),\n     field2: new FormControl({disabled: true}),\n     field3: new FormControl({disabled: true}),\n  })\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\nnow these fields have some common configuration that I added in a base class that they can extend from. ex:\n\n```ts\n\n\nexport class BaseField {\n  // Common properties and methods for all form fields\n\n  fieldName: string;\n\n  constructor(\n    public controlContainer: ControlContainer,\n    public destroyRef: DestroyRef,\n\n    fieldName: string\n  ) {\n    this.fieldName = fieldName;\n    this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => this.control.disable());\n\n\n    // my work around for not using onInit to avoid overriding the field's onInit\n    setTimeOut(() => {\n     this.control.enable() \n   }, 0)\n\n\n  }\n\n ngOnInit(){} // this will override the field's on init\n\n  get form() {\n    const form = this.controlContainer?.control;\n    if (!form) {\n      throw new Error('ControlContainer [Base Form] is not available');\n    }\n    return form as FormGroup;\n  }\n\n  get control() {\n    const control = this.form?.get(this.fieldName);\n    if (!control) {\n      throw new Error(`ControlContainer [${this.fieldName}] is not available`);\n    }\n    return control;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdding `initRef` that works in a similar way to the `destroyRef`. ex:\n\n\n```ts\n constructor(\n    public controlContainer: ControlContainer,\n    public destroyRef: DestroyRef,\n    public initRef: InitRef,\n    fieldName: string\n  ) {\n    this.fieldName = fieldName;\n    this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => this.control.disable());\n\n    this.initRef.onInit(() => {this.control.enable() }\n  }\n\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI considered adding an abstract onInit function for other devs to fill in their logic in it.\nI considered using `super.onInit` inside the onInit of each field.\n\n\nbut the main Idea that I do not want to enforce an un-needed line that can be abstracted.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62075","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"(initRef) being able to access the initRef in a similar way to DestroyRef\"

ControlValueAccessor fails to disable a parent FormGroup with a FormArray as sibling","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe App component contains this FormGroup:\n\n```ts\n// main.ts (extract)\n  protected form = new FormGroup({\n    ctl: new FormControl(),\n    arr: new FormArray([]),\n  });\n```\n\nThe `FormArray` is not realized in the template, but the `ctl` has an associated `ControlValueAccessor` implementation in `CustomControlComponent`:\n\n```html\n<!-- app.component.html (extract) -->\n<div [formGroup]=\"form\">\n  <custom-control formControlName=\"ctl\"></custom-control>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `custom-control` is a bare-bone `ControlValueAccessor` that simply wraps a `FormControl`. All the inner `FormControl`’s events are passed through the `CustomControlComponent`, and `ControlValueAccessor` calls on the `CustomControlComponent` are passed through to the wrapped `FormControl`.\n\nThe `CustomControlComponent` implements `setDisabledState`, which calls `disable` viz. `enable` on the wrapped `FormControl`. Notice the `{emitEvent: true}` in the disable call (not passing an argument makes no difference).\n\n```ts\n// custom-control.component.ts (extract)\nexport class CustomControlComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  protected ctl = new FormControl();\n\n  public setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {\n    if (isDisabled) {\n      this.ctl.disable({ emitEvent: true });\n    } else {\n      this.ctl.enable();\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWhen disabling the `FormGroup`, `CustomControlComponent::ctl` gets disabled as expected. However, the `FormGroup` gets re-enabled by the event emission. This is visible via the output\n\n> Status: enabled but should be disabled\n\nin the `AppComponent`’s HTML.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-dkv8xtfe?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo Error\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 20.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.2\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAll of the following lead to the FormGroup’s disabling as expected:\n\n- Removing the `FormArray` from the `FormGroup`\n- Replacing the `CustomFormControl` with a regular `ControlValueAccessor` (i.e., changing app.component.html, l. 4 with `<input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"ctl\">`)\n- Preventing the emission of the event (i.e. replacing custom-control.component.ts, l. 28 with `this.ctl.disable({ emitEvent: true });`)\n\n\n\nThe bug is also reproducible in\n\n```\nAngular CLI: 19.2.15\nNode: 18.20.4\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.14\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.15\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.15\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.15\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.15\n@angular/cli                    19.2.15\n@schematics/angular             19.2.15\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Disabling a FormControl wrapped in a ControlValueAccessor fails to disable a parent FormGroup with a FormArray as sibling\" (#62071)"},{"Id":"3149427657","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-16T10:22:33","Actor":"geromegrignon","Number":"62070","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): migrate @Input examples to Signal inputs","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

components results in the entire component being in the initial bundle","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen configuring default options for mat-components in `ApplicationConfig`, the entire component is being included in the initial bundle rather than being lazy-loaded along with the components that use them.\n\nObviously, you could load the config at every component, but that would be quite annoying.\n\n```typescript\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners(),\n    provideZonelessChangeDetection(),\n    provideRouter(routes),\n    /*{\n      provide: MAT_FORM_FIELD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,\n      useValue: {\n        subscriptSizing: \"dynamic\",\n        appearance: \"outline\",\n        floatLabel: \"always\",\n      } as MatFormFieldDefaultOptions,\n    },*/\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nExample with the app in the Stackblitz with the options commented:\n```\nInitial chunk files | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-UP2ZEWFZ.js   | -              | 136.87 kB |                40.26 kB\nmain-GUD7ZPGJ.js    | main           |  78.08 kB |                19.85 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css | styles         |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                    | Initial total  | 214.96 kB |                60.12 kB\n\nLazy chunk files    | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-5PV7XSBR.js   | test-component |  59.39 kB |                10.30 kB\n```\n\nWithout the comment:\n```\nInitial chunk files | Names          |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nchunk-NOK43ORO.js   | -              | 195.29 kB |                49.77 kB\nmain-EVKXTY5S.js    | main           |  78.18 kB |                19.88 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css | styles         |   0

size\nchunk-IGEEQONQ.js   | test-component | 304 bytes |               304 bytes\n```\n\nIf you happen to configure snack-bar, form-field, and dialog, you already reach a bundle size of 405kB, which is just shy of the 500kB warning for initial bundle size. If you add anything remotely big like a CSS theme, you're easily over that limit. Note that if you add a pre-built Material theme, it adds an extra 7kB.\n\nI'm not sure about the internals of the library, but it seems rather odd. I feel like the injection tokens shouldn't cause the rest of the features to be loaded.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ldgbpznx-ia2hbzsb?file=src%2Ftest.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLoad the actual components lazily.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe components are in the initial bundle.\n\n### Environment\n```\n\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.2\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.3\n... cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms, material\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.2\n@angular/build               20.0.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Configuring default options for different mat components results in the entire component being in the initial bundle\" (#31342)"},{"Id":"3139199565","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-12T07:38:25","Actor":"dinesh250-star","Number":"31341","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(BUTTON): mat-button changed to matButton in angular material 20","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn angular 20, mat-button has been changed to matButton.

This value was added in TypeScript 5.4 and is intended to model the behavior of modern bundlers such as used in the default `application` builder. This option value also has the advantage of automatically enabling `esModuleInterop` and setting `moduleResolution` to `bundler` which are the currently generated values for new projects. This allows explicit use of these options to be removed from the generated file. The `resolveJsonModule` option is also enabled with `preserve` which removes the need for developers to manually add it if JSON files are imported. JSON file imports are fully support including unused property treeshaking with named imports in the `application` builder.\r\nAdditional details on the option can be found here:

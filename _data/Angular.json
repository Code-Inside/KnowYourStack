TMK, all major browsers and Node runtimes support all ES2018 features, or at the very least, the ES2018 features that RxJS uses within the library.\r\n\r\nIdeally, RxJS would be able to publish ES2018 as part of our release _instead_ of ES2015, as it would help with bundle size, and async iterable support.\r\n\r\nI know this is a tall order, but I wanted to create this issue as sort of a sign post to point people towards as issues around this come up on the RxJS repository.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38782","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Moving off of Zones and building to target ES2018.\" (#38782)"},{"Id":"697216027","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-09T22:54:14","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"38779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(dev-infra): include CI status check in the caretaker check","State":"open","Body":"Add a CI status check in the ng-dev caretaker check command.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38779","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(dev-infra): include CI status check in the caretaker check\" (#38779)"},{"Id":"697200302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-09T22:24:02","Actor":"yefim","Number":"38778","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Element is not removed and readded to the DOM properly","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/elements\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen an Angular Element is detached from the DOM and then re-attached, none of the event bindings work (see minimal reproduction for demo). I am a Google engineer and this is causing issues for us (internal bug filed here: http://b/168062117).\r\n\r\nI talked to @kseamon about this and he thinks the issue is located in either of these 2 places:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a69507a0adc0e559d152eb3fb988a410ef9352a7/packages/elements/src/create-custom-element.ts#L219\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a69507a0adc0e559d152eb3fb988a410ef9352a7/packages/elements/src/component-factory-strategy.ts#L109-L125\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `this.scheduledDestroyFn` in not set to `null` in the scheduled destroy and so may be called again upon connect. I'm testing adding one line to see if it fixes the immediate issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, even with this fix, there will still exist a tiny race condition that occurs when an element is scheduled to be destroyed and then connects before the destroy executes.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ovchwr?file=src%2Findex.html\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNo user-visible exception\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n\r\nI'm running it against the latest Angular in google3.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38778","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Element is not removed and readded to the DOM properly\" (#38778)"},{"Id":"697186887","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-09T21:58:06","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"38776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Verify breaking changes note presence before merging a PR","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\nFor PRs that contain the \"breaking changes\" flag, it'd be great to have a check that would make sure that at least one commit has a message that contains the \"BREAKING CHANGE\" note (in a format compatible with the change log generation script). That should make sure that there are no breaking changes merged without adding the necessary note to the change log.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that the \"breaking changes\" flag might be assigned after CI has completed, having the check in the `lint` job might not be sufficient, so it looks like the merge script is the best location.

Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0)\n\n##### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   minimum supported `Node.js` version is `10.13`\n-   minimum supported `webpack` version is `4`\n-   `postcss` was moved to `peerDependencies`, you need to install `postcss`\n-   `PostCSS` (`plugins`/`syntax`/`parser`/`stringifier`) options was moved to the `postcssOptions` option, please look at [docs](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#postcssoptions)\n-   `sourceMap` default value depends on the `compiler.devtool` option\n-   the `inline` value was removed for the `sourceMap` option, please use `{ map: { inline: true, annotation: false } }` to achieve this\n-   source maps contain absolute paths in `sources`\n-   loader output only CSS, so you need to use `css-loader`/`file-loader`/`raw-loader` to inject code inside bundle\n-   `exec` option was renamed to the `execute` option\n-   the `config` option doesn't support `Object` type anymore, `config.path` and `config.ctx` options were removed\n-   argument in the config for `Function` notation (previously `config.ctx`) was changed, now it contains `{ file, mode, webpackLoaderContext }`\n-   loader context in the config was renamed from `webpack` to `webpackLoaderContext`\n\n##### Features\n\n-   message API for emit assets ([#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/443)) ([e966ab9](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/e966ab965132ca812cb50e5eaf7df5fc2ad9c137))\n-   reuse AST from other loaders ([#&#8203;468](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/468)) ([9b75888](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/9b75888dff4957f2ef1e94eca871e329354a9f6d))\n-   allows to use config and loader options together, options from the loader takes precedence over the config, the `plugins` option from the config and options are merged ([0eb5aaf](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/0eb5aaf3d49f6d5e570a3c3fdb6b201487e503c7))\n-   `postcssOptions` options can be `Function`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   compatibility with webpack@5 ([#&#8203;437](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/437)) ([ed50491](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/ed504910b70b4d8b4d77084c19ad92330676433e))\n-   `default` export for plugins ([#&#8203;465](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/465)) ([3d32c35](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/3d32c35c5c911d6bd25dc0c4b5b3cd11408632d7))\n-

We‚Äôre proposing to offer an out-of-the-box solution with little or no configuration needed.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nCSS files are [render-blocking](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css) because the browser must download and parse these files before starting to render the page. This makes CSS files a bottleneck when they are large or when having poor or limited network connectivity. Each of these files will result in a penalty on the Performance Score of your application #17966.\r\n\r\nWe can reduce this render-blocking time and at the same time improve the [first contentful paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/) (FCP) by extracting and inlining the critical CSS and loading the CSS files asynchronously.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n## Load CSS files asynchronously\r\n\r\nIn most cases JavaScript bundles will take a longer time to download, parse than for Angular to bootstrap and start rendering the first component thus the chance of having Flash of unstyled content (FOUC) is relatively low. \r\n\r\nWe are proposing to introduce an experimental async CSS loading use the ‚Äú**media**‚Äù technique which can be opted-in/out via an option angular.json\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" media=\"only x\" onload=\"this.media='all'\">\r\n<noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"></noscript>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CSS files budgets\r\nCSS files are great for code-sharing, but other than that they are a bottleneck to achieving great performance. Two of the main reasons for this is that they are render blocking and might contain dead-rules. \r\n\r\nSince a CSS file is not strictly associated with the components loaded on the page, a number of CSS declarations that get downloaded and parsed will remain unused by the view that was rendered.\r\n\r\nHaving render blocking and/or dead-rules will cause performance score penalties in Lighthouse.\r\n\r\nWe propose to add two new bundle budgets allStyle and anyStyle:\r\n\r\n- **anyStyle**: any given external CSS files\r\n- **allStyle**: cumulative size of all external CSS files.\r\n\r\n## Inline Google Fonts and Icons\r\nWe are proposing to introduce an experimental optimization for fonts which can be opted-in/out via an option in angular.json.\r\n\r\nDuring build time we will parse the index.html, download the content of stylesheets originating from `https://fonts.googleapis.com/‚Ä¶` and inline their content.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the extra round trip that the browser has to make to fetch the font declarations, which improves LCP, reduces FOUC, and also unlike other approaches doesn't prohibit Angular applications from taking full advantage of `font-display: optional`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\">\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  @font-face {\r\n    font-family: 'Material Icons';\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/materialicons/v55/flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-Vdg-IuiaDsNcIhQ8tQ.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .material-icons {\r\n    font-family: 'Material Icons';\r\n    font-weight: normal;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-size: 24px;\r\n    line-height: 1;\r\n    letter-spacing: normal;\r\n    text-transform: none;\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    white-space: nowrap;\r\n    word-wrap: normal;\r\n    direction: ltr;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case the application needs to support Internet Explorer 11 which will be determined via the [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration, the `woff1` definition of the font will also be inlined.\r\n\r\n## Extract Critical CSS\r\nThe most generic which requires zero to no configuration from the developer is to inline critical CSS as a post-rendering step using existing projects such as: [penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse), [critters](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters) and [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical). \r\n\r\nThe above mentioned tools take different approaches to extract critical CSS. The approach that **Critters** uses is the best fit for our use cases. The main reason for this is that Critters doesn‚Äôt use a headless browser but uses a JavaScript DOM (JSDOM) to render the page content which makes it faster compared to the other tools and hence it makes it valuable to be used as a build time and runtime option. The main trade-off of this is that it doesn't predict the viewport and inlines all the CSS declarations used by the document.\r\n\r\n### SSR\r\nIn Angular Universal SSR we cannot use Critters directly because this is a Webpack plugin and rendering of Angular Universal pages for both dynamic and static applications happens outside of the Webpack build. Therefore, a more decoupled version of Critters core functionality would be needed.\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôll run Critters during runtime. When a request hits the server and the Angular SSR page is rendered, we will run Critters as a post-rendering phase to extract the critical CSS and inline in the final HTML response.\r\n\r\n### App-Shell & Pre-rendering\r\nAs a post-rendering phase during build time, we‚Äôll run Critters to extract the critical CSS of the rendered page and inline the contents in the HTML document.\r\n\r\n### CSP\r\nIn Angular CSP, we cannot extract and inline CSS because we are unable to run it in a Node.Js environment, However, it is common for CSP‚Äôs to have a custom loading experience outside of Angular context defined in the index.html file. Therefore, we are proposing to extract and inline CSS for this use case to reduce the risk of FOUC even further.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nBelow are some alternatives that we have considered but deemed less useful / less feasible compared to the main proposal.\r\n\r\n## Annotating critical CSS\r\nAnnotating critical CSS with a comment and tools such as [postcss-critical-split](https://github.com/mrnocreativity/postcss-critical-split#readme) will extract these into a separate file which can later be inlined.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* critical:start */\r\nheader {\r\n  background-color: #1d1d1d;\r\n  font-size: 2em;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.aside {\r\n  text-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n/* critical:end */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe drawback of this is that It will be up to the developer to determine which CSS declarations are critical or not. Developers will also not be able to annotate critical styles which are not part of the application such as when depending on a vendored UI framework library such as Material, Bootstrap etc...\r\n\r\nHence this approach is more complex, has a bigger learning curve and is error prone.\r\n\r\n## Using headless browsers based extractors\r\n[Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse) is a critical CSS extractor and can do so for non SSR‚Äôd applications. This is because under the hood it uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to generate the critical CSS.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this is that this approach will be different from what‚Äôs proposed for Angular Universal and is slower. \r\n\r\n## Include CSS files in app root component\r\nAnother approach would be to include the global styles in the app root component.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n selector: 'app-root',\r\n templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n styleUrls: [\r\n   './styles.css',\r\n   './app.component.css',\r\n ],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this is that the entire contents of **styles.css** will be inlined in the HTML page when using Angular Universal or App shell.\r\n\r\n## DNS-Prefetch and Preconnect Hints\r\nAdd [dns-prefetch and preconnect hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch) for  for `https://fonts.gstatic.com` to initiate DNS resolution and a connection.\r\n\r\n# Additional Resources\r\n- https://web.dev/vitals/\r\n- https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch/\r\n- https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters/\r\n- https://web.dev/preload-optional-fonts/\r\n- https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/\r\n- https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n- Should these features be on opt-in or opt-out bases?\r\n- Should we add the bundle budgets to existing applications?

clone location ","State":"closed","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nWhen dragging an element using cdkDrag, a clone is appended to body [see here](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/f951bf405ca0da9047afe558aaf2c74e5139b87a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L734) \r\n\r\nWhilst end of body is a sensible default location, it'd be great if this were configurable to a DOM Element or ElementRef.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nWe have an Angular component library which is built against a \"global\" CSS package.\r\n\r\nEach selector in the global CSS package is selector scoped against a data attribute describing which brand is belongs to, such as `[data-theme=\"blue\"] .button`\r\n\r\nThis enables a single microfrontend to be easily theme switched based on user / channel context.\r\nOur `<body>` looks something akin to:\r\n```html\r\n...\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n    <div data-theme=\"blue\">\r\n        <app-one-root>\r\n            <button class=\"button\">Button</button>\r\n        </app-one-root>\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\n    <div data-theme=\"red\">\r\n        <app-two-root>\r\n            <button class=\"button\">Button</button>\r\n        </app-two-root>\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nWhen using the Drag and Drop module, the clone is created outside either of the scoped themes so therefore the clone is unstyled so you get something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n...\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n    <div data-theme=\"blue\">\r\n        <app-one-root>\r\n            <button class=\"button\">Button</button>\r\n        </app-one-root>\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\n    <div data-theme=\"red\">\r\n        <app-two-root>\r\n            <button class=\"button\">Button</button>\r\n        </app-two-root>\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\n    <button class=\"button cdk-drag cdk-drag-dragging\">Button</button> <--- Outside of CSS scope\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhilst this problem doesn't happen when using style encapsulated components, we're unable to achieve the desired multi-theming thanks to having to support IE11 and it's lack of support for custom properties.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I can think of is similar to the CDK Portal, being able to control where it embeds.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20536","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue

For accessibility reasons we still want to link the `label` with the underlying `FormControl`. To do so, we need to remove the attribute reflection on the Host element to prevent having multiple Ids on the page.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// This code prevents the attribute reflection of the Id attribute into the DOM\r\n@HostBinding('attr.id') null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that this breaks the lookup via `selector` on the base options. We would need to change the lookup to check the `FormControl` instead of the `Host`.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could provide custom `HarnessFilters`. But then we would need to rename the `options`. It would be nice if we could override or disable the base options. Disabling or overriding the base options would allow us to keep a consistent interface throughout all components in our UI framework. Basically every `Harness` object would always provide the `selector` plus maybe something additional.\r\n\r\n#### Possible solutions / approaches\r\n\r\nPass in custom match function\r\n\r\n*The HarnessPredicate could accept a custom match function*\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  constructor(public harnessType: ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>, \r\n  \t\t     options: BaseHarnessFilters,\r\n                     matchFunction?: ((option: BaseHarnessFilters) => Promise<boolean>) | null) \r\n{  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOption to disable the base functions and then use the addOption to provide them yourself\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  constructor(public harnessType: ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>, \r\n  \t\t      options: BaseHarnessFilters,\r\n                      disableBaseFunctions = false)\r\n  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand then inside our Harness implementation:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n static with(options: BaseHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<CustomHarness> {\r\n    return new HarnessPredicate(CustomHarness, options).addOption(\r\n      'custom selector option',\r\n      options.selector,\r\n      async (harness: CustomHarness, selector: string) => {\r\n        if (selector.startsWith('#')) {\r\n          const inputField = await harness.getInputFieldElement();\r\n          console.log(`#${inputField.getAttribute('id')}` === selector);\r\n          return HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(\r\n            `#${inputField.getAttribute('id')}`,\r\n            selector\r\n          );\r\n        }\r\n        return (await harness.host()).matchesSelector(selector);\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of those proposed solutions.

I have attached animated gif files showing the issue.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a MatDialog is opened it should display at the correct size.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a MatDialog is opened it displays at an unexpected size, refreshing the screen (Ctrl-F5) fixes the issue i.e. if then displays at the expected size.\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\nOur testers have reported a strange issue when we publish our documents to sharepoint. We are using a  third party document viewer. After the document is published to sharepoint we lock the document as read only using the third party document viewer. We have raised the issue with the third party supplier but their document viewer is in an iFrame so they don't think it could be causing our issue.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this the user opens another dialog box and it displays at unexpected dimensions. If I refresh the screen, the dialog box, displays at its expected dimensions. See attached 37221.gif. We are using a MatDialog component.\r\n\r\nThe current width of the dialog box and height is set as a percentage. What I did was to hard code the width, height, min width, max width, min height and max height to be a certain amount of fixed screen pixels like this:\r\n        dialogConfig.width = '1000px';\r\n        dialogConfig.minWidth = '1000px';\r\n        dialogConfig.maxWidth = '1000px';\r\n        dialogConfig.minHeight = '600px';\r\n        dialogConfig.height = '600px';\r\n        dialogConfig.maxHeight = '600px';\r\n\r\nI then emptied the dialog box of all content (html) and formatting (css) and repeated the steps. I have left the typescript code for the MatDialog as is, but none of that does anything to the width or height. These are only set when the dialog opens. The dialog box is now blank but the issue still exists. I have attached the video 37721_blank. So I really don't think this is an issue with our code. As per above we don't think it is anything to do with the document viewer. Could the MatDialog itself be causing this issue? How do we fix this?\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.14\r\n- Material\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System: When I run locally I use windows. The deployed version runs on Azure.

When scrolling through the list you may see that the image above changes, also one of the markers on the map will get a white dot. \r\n\r\nThe \"checkbox\" (\"X\" or checkmark over small image) tells the user whenever it is the one he wanted or not.

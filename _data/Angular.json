In practice, the version is determined by the contents of the ngsw.json file, which includes hashes for all known content. If any of the cached files change, the file's hash changes in ngsw.json. This change causes the Angular service worker to treat the active set of files as a new version.\n\nAssuming that the refered hash is the one included in `VersionReadyEvent.latestVersion.hash`, this is currently not the case. From my testing, each build results in a new version hash even if a) the build hash is the same and b) the `hashTable` of ngsw.json is the same. (So effectively, the only thing that changes in ngsw.json is the `timestamp` property)\n\nThis in turn causes SwUpdate to detect unnecessary updates with no changes.\n\nUpdate:\nAs I suspected it is the `timestamp` in ngsw.json that is affecting the version hash.

I didn't want to bring it up directly after the Resource-RFC and made sure to use Resources in real applications. However, I keep running into cases where lazy-loaded resources would be more appropriate than eager-loaded (is that even a term?) resources.\n\n\nSome concrete example:\nIn our application, a user selects an \"organisation\" (as in a company) When an organisation is selected, all components refer to that specific organisation.\n\nOur application has two types of components.\n- Regular Components\n- Admin Components\n\nMost of the time, regardless of whether you are admin or a regular user, you will be using the regular components.\n\n\nWhenever you enter an Admin Component, we need admin-related data for the currently selected organisation. To simplify the use-case, let's say that that admin-related data comes from an endpoint that is heavy to our API and we want to avoid reloading that data unless it's absolutely required.\n\nWe only want to reload that data if:\n- You are in an Admin Component AND\n- You switch the current organisation to another.\n\n**We don't want to reload the data if you move from Admin Component -> Regular Component -> Admin Component without changing the organisation.**\n\n\n```typescript\n@Injectable({providedIn: \"root\"})\nclass OrgService {\n    public readonly orgId = signal<number>(42);\n\n    // Only needed in admin components\n    public readonly adminData = resource({\n        request: this.orgId,\n        loader: async ({request: orgId}) => {\n            return this.load(orgId);\n        },\n    });\n\n    private load(orgId: number): Promise<Org> {\n        // Heavy request for our API.\n        return Promise.resolve(new Org());\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a flag to the resource API that would make it behave like `computed` rather than `effect`, let's call it `lazy: boolean`.\n\nThis flag would make the resource only run the fetcher if any of the `state`, `value`, or `error` signals is currently being tracked in user-land.\nIf the signals are no longer tracked, the resource should still hold on to its value, in case those signals are tracked again. \nIf the source signal changes, the resource gets cleared and its status goes to Idle if the resource is untracked or to Loading if the resource is tracked.\n\nThis would address the address the main point that was made against my idea of making this behaviour the default behaviour, which was the this might result in potential waterfalling of resources. Since this is opt-in, you'd understand the consequence.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- No lazy loading: The first time, the resource would be loaded when needed, but then, if the user switches organisations, it will reload the resource regardless of needing it or not.\n- Have the service not be `providedIn: \"root\"`, but only in admin components, but then it would trigger the reload whenever you leave and re-enter.\n- Somehow build a source-signal that will be `undefined` under the right circumstances described above, but that is error-prone since it's very hacky.\n- Have the resource be in a `\"providedIn: null\"` and cache responses statically. But this does defeat the purpose of resources and isn't a general-use solution, you'd have to find an appropriate hack for all your use cases.\n\n```typescript\n@Injectable({providedIn: null})\nclass OrgAdminService {\n    private static lastCachedOrgId: number | undefined;\n    private static cachedAdminData: AdminData | undefined;\n\n    public readonly orgId = signal<number>(42);\n\n    // Only needed in admin components\n    public readonly adminData = resource({\n        request: this.orgId,\n        loader: async ({request: orgId, abortSignal}) => {\n            if (orgId === OrgAdminService.lastCachedOrgId) {\n                return OrgAdminService.cachedAdminData;\n            }\n\n            OrgAdminService.lastCachedOrgId = undefined;\n            OrgAdminService.cachedAdminData = undefined;\n\n            const loadedValue = this.loadAdminData(orgId);\n\n            if (!abortSignal.aborted) {\n                OrgAdminService.lastCachedOrgId = orgId;\n                OrgAdminService.cachedAdminData = loadedValue;\n            }\n\n            return loadedValue;\n        },\n    });\n\n    private loadAdminData(orgId: number): Promise<AdminData> {\n        // Heavy request for our API.\n        return Promise.resolve(new AdminData());\n    }\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61296","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Built-in lazy-loading support for resources\" (#61296)"},{"Id":"3059048065","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T08:56:20","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"61295","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable PNPM auto installs (20.0.x)","State":"closed","Body":"Avoid pnpm auto-installing peer dependencies.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.15.6...v9.15.7)\n\n#### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not leave a directory with a broken pnpm installation if the installation fails.\n-   Allow scope registry CLI option without `--config.` prefix such as `--@&#8203;scope:registry=https://scope.example.com/npm` [#&#8203;9089](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9089).\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not read the pnpm settings from the `package.json` file in the current working directory.\n-   `pnpm update -i` should list only packages that have newer versions [#&#8203;9206](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9206).\n-   Fix a bug causing entries in the `catalogs` section of the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to be removed when `dedupe-peer-dependents=false` on a filtered install.

The problem is more general though.\n\nThe logs are far too unprecise to help finding the piece of code at fault. The traceback is not deep enough to recover the call sequence too. Plus, async calls and the observers nature make even more hazardous the use of `console.log` to investigate.\n\nIn my case, I simply got such tracebacks at first :\n```bash\n00:48:54 [vite] Internal server error: undefined\n      at AbortSignal.abortHandler (C:\\Users\\Someone\\WebstormProjects\\my-project\\.angular\\cache\\19.2.10\\my-project\\vite\\deps_ssr\\chunk-ZONHDKL3.js:10329:14)\n      at [nodejs.internal.kHybridDispatch] (node:internal/event_target:827:20)\n      at AbortSignal.dispatchEvent (node:internal/event_target:762:26)\n      at runAbort (node:internal/abort_controller:447:10)\n      at abortSignal (node:internal/abort_controller:433:3)\n      at AbortController.abort (node:internal/abort_controller:466:5)\n      at AbortSignal.abort (node:internal/deps/undici/undici:9536:14)\n      at [nodejs.internal.kHybridDispatch] (node:internal/event_target:827:20)\n      at AbortSignal.dispatchEvent (node:internal/event_target:762:26)\n      at runAbort (node:internal/abort_controller:447:10) (x18)\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"str\" argument must be of type string.

Like in the following:\n```typescript\n  getData(): Observable<any[]> {\n    return this.httpClient.get<any[]>(this.apiUrl).pipe(\n      catchError(() => of(defaultData)),\n      shareReplay(1)\n    );\n  }\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIf you have any way of making the logs or the traceback more explicit when vite fails with `Internal server error: undefined`, it would be of great help !\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf there is some tooling helping the debug of Vite, you may add some documentation or a blog post.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve logs and trace for [vite] Internal server error: undefined\"

When a component's `theme ` mixin was called, those values were used. This indirection is difficult to follow in the code, making it unclear when values were created and how they are pulled, because the theme files were not actually calling the m3 token files.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmat.define-theme() -> m3-badge.get-tokens($system) -> $theme\r\n...\r\nmat.badge-theme($theme) -> map.get($theme, tokens) -> token-utils.create-token-values($tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change makes the flow very clear: a theme config is created with some system values, and then the token file is directly called from the theme config. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmat.define-theme() -> $theme\r\n...\r\nmat.badge-theme($theme) -> m3-badge.get-tokens($theme) -> token-utils.create-token-values($tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also clears up the mapping with variant colors, which were also inserted in the theme config in an unintuitive way. Instead, we can just perform a simple string replacement, e.g. `secondary` instead of `primary`.\r\n\r\nThe change is performed for badge to show how it will be done with the remaining components. Once that is complete, a lot of cleanup can occur to remove unnecessary flows and mixins.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31099","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove badge component token values from theme\" (#31099)"},{"Id":"3056042122","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-12T20:39:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31086","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(material/form-field): split DOM accesses into read and write","State":"closed","Body":"In the outlined appearance we have to check the width of prefixes and suffixes and then write it to the floating label.

`TestBed.tick()` instead.\n-   `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` has several\n    breaking changes:\n    -   It is renamed to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig`\n    -   The behavior applies to *all* checkNoChanges runs\n    -   The `useNgZoneOnStable` option is removed. This wasn't found to be generally\n        more useful than `interval`\n-   afterRender was renamed to afterEveryRender.\n-   This commit deprecates `ng-reflect-*` attributes and updates the runtime to stop producing them by default. Please refactor application and test code to avoid relying on `ng-reflect-*` attributes.\n\n    To enable a more seamless upgrade to v20, we've added the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function (can be imported from the `@angular/core` package), which enables the mode in which Angular would be producing those attribites (in dev mode only). You can add the `provideNgReflectAttributes()` function to the list of providers within the bootstrap call.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [b7d3f3dbfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/b7d3f3dbfcfc40000ca34087d3b8b42319468177) | feat | Allow passing ScrollOptions to ViewportScroller ([#&#8203;61002](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61002)) |\n| [fc4a56d5c5](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/fc4a56d5c5fa270dbb1402c7cafe6d4f2af571eb) | fix | rename httpResource function in factory ([#&#8203;60022](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60022)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c889382a20](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c889382a2044f9a024f475680c8573d0f7112562) | feat | detect missing structural directive imports ([#&#8203;59443](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59443)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d5fd7349fb](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d5fd7349fb8b3942f0727cd7ee62e7a7b231e9e4) | feat | introduce TestBed.tick() ([#&#8203;60993](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60993)) |\n| [e711f99d81](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/e711f99d81ea7dbd4526f859c363244fccdf0626) | feat | move `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug` to `provideCheckNoChangesConfig` ([#&#8203;60906](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60906)) |\n| [d8fbb909ce](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/d8fbb909ce4380c0ea48512cf5d364a2785fd428) | feat | rename afterRender to afterEveryRender and stabilize ([#&#8203;60999](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60999)) |\n| [8d82a39a60](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d82a39a601fbedee58f140a7432c4adf0b054ff) | fix | async EventEmitter error should not prevent stability ([#&#8203;61028](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/61028)) |\n| [624be2ef0c](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/624be2ef0c7255e62082751cc339d2cd618bd633) | fix | prevent stash listener conflicts ([#&#8203;59635](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/59635)) |\n| [c2987d8402](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/c2987d8402b7b03333b0081a7f97750cdf612e99) | refactor | stop producing `ng-reflect` attributes by default ([#&#8203;60973](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60973)) |\n\n##### http\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [ccc5cc068f](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/ccc5cc068f788013c19498c44d13530c1bc98912) | feat | add keepalive support for fetch requests ([#&#8203;60621](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60621)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n### [`v20.0.0-next.8`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2000-next8-2025-04-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.7...20.0.0-next.8)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   'in' in an expression now refers to the operator\n\n##### core\n\n-   `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is\n    renamed to `provideZonelessChangeDetection` as it is now \"Developer\n    Preview\" rather than \"Experimental\".\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `RedirectFn` can now return `Observable` or\n    `Promise`.

In this release, it is now no longer behind a flag on v20.x.\n\nThis feature has been tested on v23.x and v22.x, and we are looking for user feedback from v20.x to make more final tweaks before fully stabilizing it.\nIt now no longer emits a warning unless `--trace-require-module` is explicitly used.\nIf there happens to be any regressions caused by this feature, users can report it to the Node.js issue tracker. Meanwhile this feature can also be disabled using `--no-experimental-require-module` as a workaround.\n\nWith this feature enabled, Node.js will no longer throw `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` if `require()` is used to load a ES module. It can, however, throw `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE` if the ES module being loaded or its dependencies contain top-level `await`. When the ES module is loaded successfully by `require()`, the returned object will either be a ES module namespace object similar to what's returned by `import()`, or what gets exported as `\"module.exports\"` in the ES module.\n\nUsers can check `process.features.require_module` to see whether `require(esm)` is enabled in the current Node.js instance. For packages, the `\"module-sync\"` exports condition can be used as a way to detect `require(esm)` support in the current Node.js instance and allow both `require()` and `import` to load the same native ES module. See [the documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require) for more details about this feature.\n\nContributed by Joyee Cheung in [#&#8203;55085](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/55085)\n\n##### Module syntax detection is now enabled by default\n\nModule syntax detection (the `--experimental-detect-module` flag) is now\nenabled by default. Use `--no-experimental-detect-module` to disable it if\nneeded.\n\nSyntax detection attempts to run ambiguous files as CommonJS, and if the module\nfails to parse as CommonJS due to ES module syntax, Node.js tries again and runs\nthe file as an ES module.\nAmbiguous files are those with a `.js` or no extension, where the nearest parent\n`package.json` has no `\"type\"` field (either `\"type\": \"module\"` or\n`\"type\": \"commonjs\"`).\nSyntax detection should have no performance impact on CommonJS modules, but it\nincurs a slight performance penalty for ES modules; add `\"type\": \"module\"` to\nthe nearest parent `package.json` file to eliminate the performance cost.\nA use case unlocked by this feature is the ability to use ES module syntax in\nextensionless scripts with no nearby `package.json`.\n\nThanks to Geoffrey Booth for making this work on [#&#8203;53619](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53619).\n\n##### Other Notable Changes\n\n-   \\[[`285bb4ee14`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/285bb4ee14)] -

This was a deliberate change to prevent any website you visit from accessing your running esbuild development server. However, this change prevented (by design) certain use cases such as \"debugging in production\" by having your production website load code from `localhost` where the esbuild development server is running.\n\n    To enable this use case, esbuild is adding a feature to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (a.k.a. CORS) for [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests). Specifically, passing your origin to the new `cors` option will now set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header when the request has a matching `Origin` header. Note that this currently only works for requests that don't send a preflight `OPTIONS` request, as esbuild's development server doesn't currently support `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n    Some examples:\n\n    -   **CLI:**\n\n            esbuild --servedir=. --cors-origin=https://example.com\n\n    -   **JS:**\n\n        ```js\n        const ctx = await esbuild.context({})\n        await ctx.serve({\n          servedir: '.',\n          cors: {\n            origin: 'https://example.com',\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   **Go:**\n\n        ```go\n        ctx, _ := api.Context(api.BuildOptions{})\n        ctx.Serve(api.ServeOptions{\n          Servedir: \".\",\n          CORS: api.CORSOptions{\n            Origin: []string{\"https://example.com\"},\n          },\n        })\n        ```\n\n    The special origin `*` can be used to allow any origin to access esbuild's development server. Note that this means any website you visit will be able to read everything served by esbuild.\n\n-   Pass through invalid URLs in source maps unmodified ([#&#8203;4169](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4169))\n\n    This fixes a regression in version 0.25.0 where `sources` in source maps that form invalid URLs were not being passed through to the output. Version 0.25.0 changed the interpretation of `sources` from file paths to URLs, which means that URL parsing can now fail. Previously URLs that couldn't be parsed were replaced with the empty string. With this release, invalid URLs in `sources` should now be passed through unmodified.\n\n-   Handle exports named `__proto__` in ES modules ([#&#8203;4162](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4162), [#&#8203;4163](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4163))\n\n    In JavaScript, the special property name `__proto__` sets the prototype when used inside an object literal. Previously esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS conversion didn't special-case the property name of exports named `__proto__` so the exported getter accidentally became the prototype of the object literal. It's unclear what this affects, if anything, but it's better practice to avoid this by using a computed property name in this case.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n### [`v0.25.3`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0253)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.2...v0.25.3)\n\n-   Fix lowered `async` arrow functions before `super()` ([#&#8203;4141](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4141), [#&#8203;4142](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4142))\n\n    This change makes it possible to call an `async` arrow function in a constructor before calling `super()` when targeting environments without `async` support, as long as the function body doesn't reference `this`. Here's an example (notice the change from `this` to `null`):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (async () => await foo())()\n        super()\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --target=es2016)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (() => __async(this, null, function* () {\n          return yield foo();\n        }))();\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --target=es2016)\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      constructor() {\n        (() => __async(null, null, function* () {\n          return yield foo();\n        }))();\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Some background: Arrow functions with the `async` keyword are transformed into generator functions for older language targets such as `--target=es2016`. Since arrow functions capture `this`, the generated code forwards `this` into the body of the generator function. However, JavaScript class syntax forbids using `this` in a constructor before calling `super()`, and this forwarding was problematic since previously happened even when the function body doesn't use `this`. Starting with this release, esbuild will now only forward `this` if it's used within the function body.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://redirect.github.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Fix memory leak with `--watch=true` ([#&#8203;4131](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4131), [#&#8203;4132](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4132))\n\n    This release fixes a memory leak with esbuild when `--watch=true` is used instead of `--watch`. Previously using `--watch=true` caused esbuild to continue to use more and more memory for every rebuild, but `--watch=true` should now behave like `--watch` and not leak memory.\n\n    This bug happened because esbuild disables the garbage collector when it's not run as a long-lived process for extra speed, but esbuild's checks for which arguments cause esbuild to be a long-lived process weren't updated for the new `--watch=true` style of boolean command-line flags. This has been an issue since this boolean flag syntax was added in version 0.14.24 in 2022. These checks are unfortunately separate from the regular argument parser because of how esbuild's internals are organized (the command-line interface is exposed as a separate [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/cli) so you can build your own custom esbuild CLI).\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;mxschmitt](https://redirect.github.com/mxschmitt).\n\n-   More concise output for repeated legal comments ([#&#8203;4139](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4139))\n\n    Some libraries have many files and also use the same legal comment text in all files. Previously esbuild would copy each legal comment to the output file. Starting with this release, legal comments duplicated across separate files will now be grouped in the output file by unique comment content.\n\n-   Allow a custom host with the development server ([#&#8203;4110](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4110))\n\n    With this release, you can now use a custom non-IP `host` with esbuild's local development server (either with `--serve=` for the CLI or with the `serve()` call for the API). This was previously possible, but was intentionally broken in [version 0.25.0](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.25.0) to fix a security issue. This change adds the functionality back except that it's now opt-in and only for a single domain name that you provide.\n\n    For example, if you add a mapping in your `/etc/hosts` file from `local.example.com` to `127.0.0.1` and then use `esbuild --serve=local.example.com:8000`, you will now be able to visit http://local.example.com:8000/ in your browser and successfully connect to esbuild's development server (doing that would previously have been blocked by the browser). This should also work with HTTPS if it's enabled (see esbuild's documentation for how to do that).\n\n-   Add a limit to CSS nesting expansion ([#&#8203;4114](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4114))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now fail with an error if there is too much CSS nesting expansion. This can happen when nested CSS is converted to CSS without nesting for older browsers as expanding CSS nesting is inherently exponential due to the resulting combinatorial explosion. The expansion limit is currently hard-coded and cannot be changed, but is extremely unlikely to trigger for real code. It exists to prevent esbuild from using too much time and/or memory. Here's an example:\n\n    ```css\n    a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{color:red}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n    ```\n\n    Previously, transforming this file with `--target=safari1` took 5 seconds and generated 40mb of CSS. Trying to do that will now generate the following error instead:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] CSS nesting is causing too much expansion\n\n            example.css:1:60:\n              1 │ a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{a,b{color:red}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n                ╵                                                             ^\n\n          CSS nesting expansion was terminated because a rule was generated with 65536 selectors. This limit\n          exists to prevent esbuild from using too much time and/or memory. Please change your CSS to use\n          fewer levels of nesting.\n\n-   Fix path resolution edge case ([#&#8203;4144](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4144))\n\n    This fixes an edge case where esbuild's path resolution algorithm could deviate from node's path resolution algorithm. It involves a confusing situation where a directory shares the same file name as a file (but without the file extension). See the linked issue for specific details. This appears to be a case where esbuild is correctly following [node's published resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together) but where node itself is doing somethi\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

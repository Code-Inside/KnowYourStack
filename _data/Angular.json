(baseline).\r\n\r\nIf I build the project with `tsconfig.json` target \"es2015\" a few things do not work as I expect:\r\n\r\n1. It builds both es2015 and es5 bundles. Strangely IE11 will load both the es2015 and the es5 bundles, when I expected it to just load the es5 bundle. Chrome correctly loads just the es2015 bundle.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"ie11-loading-both-bundles\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72109101-39b63500-3389-11ea-9c5c-399d3902b68e.png\">\r\n\r\n2. The es5 bundle created when differential loading is enabled is larger than the es5 bundle created when ts.config is set to es5 and differential loading is off. In my small sample app the differences are not that large but in our production app the difference is substantial. I would have thought that the es5 differential loading bundle would be no bigger than the non differential loading use case. \r\n\r\nDifferential loading\r\n<img width=\"1407\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-app-diff-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72110982-a2071580-338d-11ea-8a23-970f84b0264c.png\">\r\n\r\nNo differential loading\r\n<img width=\"1407\" alt=\"ng8-ie11-app-diff-loading\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72110999-ab907d80-338d-11ea-8500-914f5d788afe.png\">\r\n\r\nFrom the above images you can see that the main bundle for the base ES5 scenario is 282 but for the differential loading its 298. Again this is a small sample app, in our production app this is more pronounced.\r\n\r\n3. The bundle created produces errors when running in IE11, loading ESRI maps. Again I find this strange as I would have assumed the es5 differential loading bundle would be equivalent to the bundle created when setting ts.config to es5, which works fine.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"643\" alt=\"ie11-error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441418/72111192-2c4f7980-338e-11ea-9586-b9897893d26a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vespertilian/ng8-ie11\r\n\r\nbuild with npm run build\r\nserve the dist build with ng run serve-dist (might need to install http-server)\r\n\r\nchange ts.config from es5 to es2015 to build the different packages. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust for the third case\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Object expected\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.22\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.21\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.21\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.22\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.22\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.21\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.22\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.22\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This request is a logical extension of the one-time **string** bindings which already exist in the new Angular.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- Regular binding -->\r\n<mat-icon [fontIcon]=\"someIconVariable\"></mat-icon>\r\n\r\n<!-- One-time binding to literal string -->\r\n<mat-icon fontIcon=\"cloud-upload\"></mat-icon>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have found the above feature of Angular to be exceptionally nice (along with many others!) and could not care less that we no longer have explicit one-time bindings to variables as they made it easy to introduce bugs and the performance gains pale in comparison to those netted by AOT compilation anyways.\r\n\r\nHowever, a common pattern in AngularJS material, as well as many of my own components, is to support empty attributes for boolean properties, which would be the same as binding to a literal `true`. I believe empty attributes are not technically valid XML, but it is a common practice in HTML where the presence of an attribute makes it truthy and the absence of the attribute makes it falsy, such as putting `required` on an `<input>`.\r\n\r\nWith my proposed change, the following two examples would be equivalent.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- This works -->\r\n<user-card [userID]=\"selectedUserID\" [showAdminControls]=\"true\"></user-card>\r\n\r\n<!-- This would be nice :^) -->\r\n<user-card [userID]=\"selectedUserID\" showAdminControls></user-card>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSorry, but I am not familiar with the Angular source code, so I have no idea how this would be implemented. The best I can do for now is to write a pretty issue and hope it garners some attention.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTo implement this on my components, I basically just set the initial value of the property to whether the attribute is present and empty.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n// ...\r\nexport class UserCardComponent {\r\n    // ...\r\n    @Input() showAdminControls = hasEmptyAttr(this.host.nativeElement, \"showAdminControls\");\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach is tedious and requires the programmer to keep the property/attribute names in sync. AFAIK the template compiler always reports unrecognized properties it finds in the HTML but a typo in the string in the `hasEmptyAttr(...)` call would result in a subtle bug.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: one-time boolean bindings\" (#34713)"},{"Id":"547694776","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T23:14:04","Actor":"kara","Number":"34709","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(ivy): document breaking change with <select> and binding order","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #34470\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(ivy): document breaking change with <select> and binding order\" (#34709)"},{"Id":"547709713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T21:45:37","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"34711","RawContent":null,"Title":"Windows ci tests","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34711","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Windows ci tests\" (#34711)"},{"Id":"547737812","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T21:37:26","Actor":"mstuartf","Number":"34712","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: correct full stop position in providers section","State":"open","Body":"Correct the position of the full stop at the end of the limiting provider scope with components paragraph.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, there is only a single sentence and that's it. The sentence says:\r\n\r\n> A function that will be executed when an application is initialized.\r\n\r\nBased on many other 3rd part articles (such as Medium, SOF, etc..), everyone talks about the APP_INITIALIZER as the place to put code that you need to be loaded before your application is initialized. However, the sentence in the documentation makes it seem like it's a function that runs when the app is initialized.\r\n\r\nThere are other important parts of information such as what you can put inside the function. Does it have to return anything specific? A Promise? An Observable? Anything?\r\n\r\nI've been working with angular for 6 years now and just ran into this. It's going to solve a lot of my problems if it does what the 3rd party articles say it does. It would be very helpful if more documentation was provided by the Angular team on how to actually use it the right way. This feature is very hidden. It would be nice if this was included in the Tour of Heroes as there is almost always something that needs to be pre-fetched to make the app work. In my case, it's the router configuration.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://angular.io/...\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/APP_INITIALIZER\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

In general, the way we generate completions for this is very hacky (manually parsing the expression in the language service to determine if the user is on the LHS or RHS of an `let ... of ...`). I think we should consider a better way of figuring out which side of the expression the user is on. I will attempt to work on that before moving forward with this PR.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): record correct end of expression\" (#34690)"},{"Id":"547211981","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T03:41:10","Actor":"winterchipmunk","Number":"34689","RawContent":null,"Title":"The Authorization token can not be forwarded into server side in http interceptor.","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\nI implemented AuthTokenInterceptor as below.

This would not have been a problem prior to https://github.com/angular/devkit/pull/692 assuming a private registry was accessible without proxy. It is also relevant to #13166 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNPM natively supports a `noproxy` setting in the `.npmrc` file that will prevent the proxy settings from being used for some specific URLs. This is incredibly useful when you have a private repository that is within your corporate network, but some packages, like `node-sass` will still need to reach to the internet to download binary files through the proxy.\r\n\r\nAssuming that your private registry is at `registry.company.com`, you can add either the full sub-domain, or even just `company.com` to the `noproxy` setting and NPM will go to the registry directly, but all calls to other URLs done by NPM will still go through the proxy.\r\n\r\nWhen using `ng update`, all calls using `npm-registry-client` will go through the proxy, even though they should be blacklisted by the `noproxy` list. This will cause calls to fail when using an enterprise proxy and a private registry that cannot be reached through the proxy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Setup a private npm repository that forwards calls to the official repository\r\n- Setup a proxy so that it is required to go through the proxy to reach the broad internet, but that the private npm repository MUST be reached directly.\r\n- Configure your `.npmrc` file like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproxy: myproxy.company.com\r\nhttps-proxy: myproxy.company.com\r\nnoproxy: company.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Attempt to update an angular project from angular@^6 to angular@^7 using `ng update`.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nAt this point, `ng update` will fail trying to parse the json file that is expected from the registry and print the html error page returned by the proxy instead. Something on the lines of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to parse JSON at column 1, unexpected token < in :\r\n<doctype HTML........\r\n  Cannot reach <insert package url here>.

This will work as long as the first few packages getting installed does not do any network calls in their install script. It is also an incredibly risky workaround and I would recommend anyone attempting this to delete their `node_modules` folders after the update process, set their proxy settings correctly and re-run `npm install` before moving on.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16615","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"noproxy config is not respected when running ng update\" (#16615)"},{"Id":"547216037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T20:02:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"16601","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve source map generation quality","State":"closed","Body":"The `webpack-sources` package provides the `SourceMapSource` class which provides sourcemap merging functionality including identity mapping.

This prevents browsers from sending cookies with requests for these files.  Certain environment require cookies to be sent with all requests.  In production environments, Angular CLI's `ng build` command offers an option `--crossOrigin use-credentials` which applies a `crossorigin=\"use-credentials\"` attribute to the script tag, causing headers to be sent.  In a development environment, though, `ng serve` does not offer the same options, so Angular CLI projects cannot be previewed.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nPlease enable the same `--crossOrigin` functionality for `ng serve` as exists in `ng build`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16602","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng serve --crossOrigin\"

transpilation being the default over full project type checking like `tsc`. Type checking the full project upfront is slower but expected behaviour, so it's the default once again. You can still enable `transpileOnly` or `ts-node/register/transpile-only` for the faster transpiler without type checking.\n\n**Changed**\n\n-   Default behaviour is `typeCheck == true || transpileOnly == false`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

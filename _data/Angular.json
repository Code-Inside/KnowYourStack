This defeat the use of `@Optional` because in the end the injection isn't optional.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement a new `@Required(message: string)` decorator, the framework should be able to print the friendly message instead of the not friendly _\"ERROR NullInjectorError ... No provider for <token>!\"_.\r\n\r\nIf Angular is unable to do the injection, use the friendly message. The use of `@Optional()` is a [common pattern](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2f9a59a24c0464cbed7f54cbeb5cba73e6007715/src/material/sort/sort-header.ts#L202).\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using the proposed decorator is that the production compiling phase could be able to remove these message strings and use the generic message, in order to not add extra messages to the output.

Now, `_r3Injector.resolveInjectorInitializers();` is called instead and the actual creation of the `Router` instance is deferred.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it appears to be deferred to `initComponent` in `createComponent`, which is run inside of a zone with the `isAngularZone` property set to `true`: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8340da92bb75f62961d6cc99bc223a9138929688/packages/core/testing/src/test_bed.ts#L562-L567\r\n\r\nThis ultimately causes `router.isNgZoneEnabled` to evalulate to `true` (here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8340da92bb75f62961d6cc99bc223a9138929688/packages/router/src/router.ts#L582 ), triggering the warning when calling navigate.\r\n\r\nThe reason not including the `Router` as a dependency of the component fixes the problem appears to be because the initialization of the `Router` service is deferred to the `TestBed.inject` call, which is not inside an Angular zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/JoshuaEN/angular-14-router-unit-test-log-warning\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n`console.warn:` Navigation triggered outside Angular zone, did you forget to call 'ngZone.run()'?\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"Navigation triggered outside Angular zone\" warning in unit tests\" (#47236)"},{"Id":"1348393119","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T18:41:49","Actor":"sashaqred","Number":"47234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add possibility to update particular validator","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently in angular is tough to update validators dynamically.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a component with `FromControl` and `@Input()` which contain settings for some validator. The component could update validator settings by combining the cache of validator and manual call of `removeValidators` and `addValidators`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MyCustomComponent {\r\n  @Input() set range(range: null | {min: number, max: number}) {\r\n    this.formControl.removeValidators(this.currentRangeValidator)\r\n    if (range) {\r\n      this.currentRangeValidator = customRangeValidator(range)\r\n      this.formControl.addValidators(this.currentRangeValidator);\r\n    }\r\n    this.formControl.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n  }\r\n  private currentRangeValidator: ValidatorFn | null = null;\r\n\r\n  protected formControl = new FromControl();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor if there are too many such inputs, then it could be extracted to some function with a whole override of validators:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MyCustomComponent {\r\n  @Input() set range(range: null | {min: number, max: number}) {\r\n    this.updateValidators('range', range ? customRangeValidator(range) : null)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input() set required(required: boolean) {\r\n    this.updateValidators('required', required ?

Split up into the following commits:\r\n\r\n## refactor(core): generate initial inputs from inputs map\r\nWe have some logic that generates the `InitialInputs` data structure by taking the static attributes of a node and looking them up in the `DirectiveDef.inputs` map to determine if they correspond to an input.\r\n\r\nThis works fine at the moment, but it will make it trickier to generate the correct `InitialInputs` for host directives, because the `DirectiveDef.inputs` entries might be aliased under a different name.\r\n\r\nThese changes rework the existing `generateInitialInputs` function so that it does its lookup on the remapped inputs that have accounted for the aliasing process already.\r\n\r\n\r\n## refactor(core): reshuffle directive resolution logic\r\nThese changes don't have any functional impact on the `resolveDirectives` function, but they will make implementing host directives easier and will allow us to save some memory.\r\n\r\nCurrently `resolveDirectives` can be split up into two parts: directive matching (implemented in `findDirectiveDefMatches`) and directive application (implemented inline inside `resolveDirectives`). This will be problematic for host directives, because the logic from `findDirectiveDefMatches` will have to return two pieces of information instead of one: the list of matched directives and the host directive input/output mapping. We could make it work with the current code structure, but we'd have to return a tuple type from `findDirectiveDefMatches` which will consume more memory.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by moving the logic from `findDirectiveDefMatches` into `resolveDirectives`, while the directive application logic that was previously inline inside `resolveDirectives` has now been moved out into a new `applyDirectives` function.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47228","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Host directives runtime refactors\" (#47228)"},{"Id":"1347355941","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T07:41:01","Actor":"Dev-ashraf-ali","Number":"47224","RawContent":null,"Title":"string type variable asking for initialize.

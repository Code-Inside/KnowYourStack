In general, one of the common places used to achieve this goal is the life cycle hook ngOnChange. \r\n\r\nTypically, something like: \r\n``` typescript\r\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\r\n\r\n   // a preliminary \"if\" lets you target only the input named value\r\n    if (changes['value']) {\r\n        // whenever value changes, do something\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, it seems to me the way to achieve the same goal with signals is using effects. So something like: \r\n``` typescript\r\nvalueEffect = effect(() => {\r\n\r\n    // the initial assignment makes sure the effect tracks value changes,\r\n    //\r\n    // even if test might not be needed in the untracked func (if you call \r\n    // a component method using directly this.value()).\r\n    // \r\n    // Using untracked makes sure nothing else will be tracked except for value. \r\n    // Moreover, I can set other signals within untracked. \r\n    const test = this.value();\r\n\r\n    untracked(() => {\r\n       // whenever value changes, do something\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming the considerations above are correct (otherwise sorry for having missed some important points), I have the feeling the signal alternative is a bit strange. Say: effects have a wider scope compared to ngOnChange, but less intuitive to use for a very common thing like \"react to an input change\". \r\n\r\nI'd personally like to have a more clean approach where (possibly) I clearly state that \"an effect should only track this specific signal(s) changes and react only to that\". \r\n\r\nRecently, I've noticed there've been some tickets around the same topic: #54985 and #54372. \r\n\r\nHere is a not trivial example to illustrate the differences: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ey1c9p\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI'd personally like to have a more clean approach where (possibly) I clearly state that \"an effect should only track one(many) specific signal(s) changes and react only to that\". \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIt's mostly a matter of making the intention \"react to a specific input change\" more clear... no other thing. And again: if I missed some important points, sorry!

this._http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts').subscribe({\r\n      next: (items: any) => {\r\n        this.items = items\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n// post.component.html\r\n<p>post-list works!</p>\r\n<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;\" *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        {{item.title}}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        {{item.body}}\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the following command I run the project:\r\n`npm run ssr`  // **in package.json  =>** `\"ssr\": \"npm run build && node

With the ongoing enhancements in Angular, such as the introduction of signals in Angular 17, the framework continues to improve both performance and developer experience. This feature request proposes adding a concise syntax for defining template variables directly within Angular templates, aiming to simplify the referencing of complex expressions, reactive states, and asynchronous data streams.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to introduce a `@define` syntax that allows developers to create aliases or shorthand notations for complex expressions directly within templates:\r\n```\r\n@defined(\r\n  some.component.long.object.path as foo,\r\n  some.component.signal() as bar,\r\n  some.component.async/observable() | async as baz\r\n  ) {\r\n   {{ foo }}\r\n   {{ bar }}\r\n   {{ baz }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new syntax would bring several benefits:\r\n- **Readability**: By replacing complex expressions with descriptive aliases, templates become easier to read and understand.\r\n- **Maintainability**: Centralizes complex expressions, making templates easier to maintain and refactor.\r\n- **Performance**: Minimizes the re-evaluation of expressions, potentially improving change detection performance.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n- **Using Existing Pipes**: Continue using pipes like `async` for asynchronous data. However, this does not address the verbosity of complex expressions or improve template readability.\r\n- **Component Methods**: Implementing methods in component classes that return the required data. While this approach can encapsulate complex logic, it separates the template logic from its context, potentially making templates harder to understand at a glance.\r\n\r\nThis feature request aims to complement the existing mechanisms in Angular by providing a more integrated and intuitive way to handle complex expressions within templates, further enhancing Angular's developer experience.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feature Request: Introduce Concise Syntax for Defining Template Variables in Angular Templates\" (#55004)"},{"Id":"2203545065","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-23T00:08:59","Actor":"Ahmed-Hakeem","Number":"55006","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs: add a note about adding other provider configurations as options to @Injectable","State":"open","Body":"Adding this note to expose that user can explicitly define how the service can be called using hooks = or provider configurations that are defined by InjectableProvider type","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55006","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Docs: add a note about adding other provider configurations as options to @Injectable\" (#55006)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2205059026","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-25T19:37:48","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27348","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I want to deploy an angular ssr app under a subpath of a domain, for example https://example.org/myapp. This subpath is handled by an nginx reverse proxy. So far so good.\r\n\r\nNow I'm adding baseHref to the angular.json. It gets added to the index.html, everything fine. But if I'm looking to the `server.ts` I see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the baseUrl is always empty. Because the baseUrl can only be set if the code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nserver.use('/myapp', router);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout using .use() the baseUrl MUST be empty. So I don't understand the whole purpose behind the default code? And of course it's not working with the default code, otherwise I wouldn't write.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this scenario is not possible without changing the server.ts fundamentally. And it would be nice, if this changes are described in the docs.\r\n\r\nOr if they were the default and changes to the baseHref option in the angular.json would also affect the server.ts. That I don't have to change the server.use() part manually.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17.3.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27356","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 17 SSR baseHref / baseUrl is not respected\" (#27356)"},{"Id":"2203699853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-25T10:17:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27346","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.24.9","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.24.8` -> `v3.24.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.24.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.8...v3.24.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

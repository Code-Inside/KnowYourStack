I think there is a slight inaccuracy on the Directives overview page.\nAt the top of the page, the table lists “different types of Angular directives,” including components and attributive directives. Structural directives are missing from the list.\n\nBelow, the guide describes how to work with attributive directives, but this list is in the “overview” section and, in my opinion, would be better to contain all types of directives. It is a little bit confusing that this type is not listed.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/directives\n\n### Describe what you

Service Workers, improving error detection and debugging capabilities for corrupted or unsupported message formats.\r\n\r\n## The change includes:\r\n\r\n- Added `messageerror` event listener to the Driver class\r\n- Implemented `onMessageError` method for handling message deserialization errors\r\n- Added comprehensive unit tests to verify the new functionality\r\n- Updated test harness to support messageerror event simulation\r\n- Enhanced error logging with origin information for better debugging\r\n\r\n## Motivation/Use Cases\r\n\r\nThe `messageerror` event handling is particularly useful for:\r\n\r\n- **Error Detection**: Identifying when messages cannot be deserialized due to corrupted data\r\n- **Debugging Support**: Providing detailed logging information about message errors\r\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handling unsupported message formats without breaking the service worker\r\n- **Compliance with Service Worker Standards**: Implementing the full

When closing the dialog, we clean up the effect by calling `.destroy()` on the effectRef, however we still get an error that `view[EFFECTS]` is not iterable.\n\nThis error originates from `runEffectsInView`:\n```typescript\nfunction runEffectsInView(view) {\n    if (view[EFFECTS] === null) {\n        return;\n    }\n    // Since effects can make other effects dirty, we flush them in a loop until there are no more to\n    // flush.\n    let tryFlushEffects = true;\n    while (tryFlushEffects) {\n        let foundDirtyEffect = false;\n        for (const effect of view[EFFECTS]) { // <-- ERROR IS THROWN HERE\n            if (!effect.dirty) {\n                continue;\n            }\n            foundDirtyEffect = true;\n            // `runEffectsInView` is called during change detection, and therefore runs\n            // in the Angular zone if it's available.\n            if (effect.zone === null || Zone.current === effect.zone) {\n                effect.run();\n            }\n            else {\n                effect.zone.run(() => effect.run());\n            }\n        }\n        // Check if we need to continue flushing. If we didn't find any dirty effects, then there's\n        // no need to loop back. Otherwise, check the view to see if it was marked for traversal\n        // again. If so, there's a chance that one of the effects we ran caused another effect to\n        // become dirty.\n        tryFlushEffects = foundDirtyEffect && !!(view[FLAGS] & 8192 /* LViewFlags.HasChildViewsToRefresh */);\n    }\n}\n```\nWithin the `for`-loop, the effect that closes the dialog is run, causing `view[EFFECTS]` to become null. The `tryFlushEffects` assignment doesn't take this into account, meaning that it is `true` and runs the `while`-loop again. Because the `while`-loop is entered again, the `for`-loop is invoked again, but `view[EFFECTS]` now gives us `null`, raising the error.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nroot_effect_scheduler.mjs:3583 ERROR TypeError: view[EFFECTS] is not iterable\n    at runEffectsInView (debug_node.mjs:8819:30)\n    at detectChangesInView (debug_node.mjs:9186:17)\n    at detectChangesInViewIfAttached (debug_node.mjs:9139:5)\n    at detectChangesInEmbeddedViews (debug_node.mjs:9096:13)\n    at refreshView (debug_node.mjs:8988:9)\n    at detectChangesInView (debug_node.mjs:9179:9)\n    at detectChangesInViewIfAttached (debug_node.mjs:9139:5)\n    at detectChangesInComponent (debug_node.mjs:9127:5)\n    at detectChangesInChildComponents (debug_node.mjs:9205:9)\n    at refreshView (debug_node.mjs:9014:13)\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.1\nNode: 22.13.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.1\n... animations, build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router, service-worker\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.1\n@angular/cdk                 20.1.2\n@schematics/angular          20.1.1\nng-packagr                   20.1.0\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nChanging the `tryFlushEffects` assignment to the following (including an extra check for `view[EFFECTS]`) resolves the issue.\n\n```typescript\ntryFlushEffects = foundDirtyEffect && !!(view[FLAGS] & 8192 /* LViewFlags.HasChildViewsToRefresh */) && view[EFFECTS] !== null;\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62822","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"TypeError: view[EFFECTS] is not iterable\" when effect causes a component to no longer exist\" (#62822)"},{"Id":"3263268162","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-25T13:58:18","Actor":"maran-t","Number":"62821","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): handle escaped interpolation markers in templates","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #62174\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, after upgrading to Angular v18, the build now produces a large number of small initial chunks. This was not an issue before, and seems to significantly affect performance due to increased number of HTTP requests and potential blocking.\n\nThis issue is not related to lazy-loaded modules — these are initial (eager) chunks that should ideally be bundled more efficiently.\n\n<img width=\"1466\" height=\"649\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf7303cc-4a8a-48db-8b40-038194dc247a\" />\n\n\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nAngular should produce a smaller number of optimized initial chunks, similar to how it behaved in Angular 14\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Start with an Angular 14 project with default configuration.\n2. Upgrade to Angular 18 and switch to the ESBuild-based application builder (default in v18).\n3. Run ng build in production mode.\n4. Observe the number of initial chunks generated.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.19\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.13\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.19\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.19\n@angular/cdk                    18.2.14\n@angular/cli                    18.2.19\n@angular/google-maps            18.2.14\n@angular/material               18.2.14\n@schematics/angular             18.2.19\nng-packagr                      18.2.1\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n- Angular version: 18\n- CLI builder: @angular-devkit/build-angular using ESBuild\n- Target: Production\n- Browser builder previously used: Webpack (v14)\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a documented or supported way to merge or reduce these chunks in the ESBuild configuration.\nThis could impact app performance and scalability, especially on mobile or low-bandwidth networks.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30778","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 18 build with ESBuild generates excessive number of initial chunks after migration from v14\" (#30778)"},{"Id":"3257933568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T22:57:25","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-next.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-next.1\" with changelog.\" (#30775)"},{"Id":"3257134809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T17:20:51","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30773","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30773","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.2 release\" (#30773)"},{"Id":"3257058394","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T17:13:24","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"30772","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30772","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.2\" with changelog.\" (#30772)"},{"Id":"3257163375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-23T16:46:41","Actor":"RaederDev","Number":"30774","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve (@angular/build:dev-server) provides broken chunk files","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nThis is only an issue with the dev server as far as I can tell.

*/\n```\n\nAs you can see `userRoutes` depends on `authGuard` to be set however it's declared later in the chunk file leading to the angular router throwing an Exception because undefined was passed instead of a canActivate guard.\n\nThis is an abbreviated version of the original source file:\n```ts\nimport { Routes as NgRoutes } from '@angular/router';\nimport { authGuard } from '../../shared/guards/auth-guard';\n\nexport const USER_ROUTES_PREFIX = 'user';\n\nexport const UserRoutes = {\n  PROFILE: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'profile'],\n  SETTINGS: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'settings'],\n};\n\nexport const userRoutes: NgRoutes = [\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.PROFILE.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-profile-page/user-profile-page').then(m => m.UserProfilePage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.SETTINGS.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-settings-page/user-settings-page').then(m => m.UserSettingsPage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nAs you can see it's being imported correctly and should therefore be declared before the user routes in the chunk file.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

It leads to the sub-menu being triggered while the menu system is in the process of shutting down.\n\nI have attached a GIF demonstrating the issue:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09f42468-e200-4de6-9a0c-82ea03cdaf0b)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen the parent menu is closed, no sub-menus should open or remain open, and re-opening the menu should start cleanly without previously open overlay artifacts.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- The sub-menu opens even though the root menu has already been closed.\n- The sub-menu persists on screen and behaves incorrectly when the main menu is opened again.\n- This creates confusing UI behavior and leaves orphaned overlays until another menu interaction occurs.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.15\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\nBrowser: Chrome (others not tested, but likely reproducible there as well)\n\nPackage                            Version\n------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1902.15\n@angular-devkit/core               19.2.15\n@angular-devkit/schematics         19.2.15\n@angular/cdk                       19.2.19\n@angular/cli                       19.2.15\n@angular/fire                      19.2.0\n@angular/material                  19.2.19\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   19.2.19\n@schematics/angular                19.2.15\nrxjs                               7.8.2\ntypescript                         5.8.3\nzone.js                            0.15.1","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31598","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-menu): sub-menu opens even after root menu is closed due to fast mouse movement\" (#31598)"},{"Id":"3258509960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-25T08:20:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31589","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.29.4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.29.3` -> `v3.29.4` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.29.4`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.29.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.29.3...v3.29.4)\n\n### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n#### 3.29.4 - 23 Jul 2025\n\nNo user facing changes.\n\nSee the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/v3.29.4/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The fix changes that case name from `UNKNOWN` to `_UNKNOWN`. If you have existing generated enums, you may need to rebuild your project.\n  - \\[fixed] Kotlin codegen: Add `value` property to the `EnumValue` base interface.\n  - \\[fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where nullable enum fields weren't setting the field itself as nullable.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

          provideHttpClientTesting(),\n            ]\n        }).compileComponents();\n    }));\n```\n\nIt would be better if members were not reordered, but I could live with it, but the indentation causes more time waste trying to fix it.\n\nIn the case of this migration, it only needed to touch the **contents** of `providers` and `imports`, not the rest of the TestBed configuration nor the top-level entries themselves.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNone\n```\n\n###

and they are in some situations completely different approaches how to solve them - e.g. using computed vs using input setter - and while this isn't a temporary situation as Angular team promised to keep the support for zone.js for a long future\nthis will mean as an Angular developer I will have to deal with both signal based and non-signal based way of doing things, and from the ngPoland I understand that there will be even more changes coming to Forms, Routing and HttpClient to be built with signals in mind\nthat will make Angular projects in the future become completely different flavor of being signal/zoneless or zoned/non-signal\nthat leaves a big problem in the long term documentation, of course they will be updated to match the new signal flavor, but when developers want to go to to the docs to find how to do things in a non-signal project they will not find any\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nthe angular.dev should have where it make sense a tab/toggle to show the content that is related to signal or non-signal\nit should behave similar to https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs/#projects-without-type-checking where you switch between flat config and legacy config but between signal/non-signal way, it could be even called signal/legacy to show people that they are using an old API and encourage them to update\nI understand that will make the angular.dev more complicated but it's useful for developers who started their career and learning Angular with Signals with mind, then go to work on a company where they have still some code using the non-signal way\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\ntwo alternatives\n1. that when people want to see the other way to do things to go to old docs https://v17.angular.io/docs\n  this approach have a problem about changes that were made to these things, let's imagine in the future there is a new method added to the non-signal route service, now these old docs won't have it, that's especially useful for scenarios where Angular team might have added this method to make it easier to switch to the signal-based route\n2. to have seperate pages for signal and non-signals things that are significantly different and different sections or a note for the other pages that have small yet important change between them\n  this approach is less complicated from technical perspective, but less user friendly since users will be seeing pages/sections unrelated to what they are looking for","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58825","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"in angular.dev add

I will describe the high level conditions here, and go into more detail in the 'Minimal Reproduction' below.\n- The Angular build is triggered via the .NET build system. An `.esproj` project is used for the Angular application.\n- The issue happens in the Azure Pipelines CI/CD pipeline, but only on a Ubuntu runner, not on a Windows runner.\n- Executing the same command on my development PC under WSL Ubuntu works fine.\n\nThe baffling thing for me is that the exception mentions a '.NET build system specific'-folder: `PROJECT_NAME/obj/Debug` while I verified that the current working directory in which the `npm run build` command is executed is actually the `PROJECT_NAME` folder.\nSo where is the Angular build system getting this folder from? And why is it using that folder instead of the current working directory?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new Angular application `ng new repro-app`.\n2. Create a project file in the root of the application directory: `application.esproj` with the following contents:\n    ```xml\n   <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.JavaScript.Sdk/1.0.2039730\">\n     <PropertyGroup>\n       <BuildCommand>echo \"$PWD\" &amp;&amp; npm run version &amp;&amp; npm run build</BuildCommand>\n       <StartupCommand>npm start</StartupCommand>\n       <TestCommand>npm run test</TestCommand>\n       <JavaScriptTestFramework>Jasmine</JavaScriptTestFramework>\n       <BuildOutputFolder>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\dist\\browser\\</BuildOutputFolder>\n     </PropertyGroup>\n   </Project>\n    ```\n3. Reference this project from a normal .NET project file.\n4.

For now, I only need the SSR part, not making use of any other `RenderMode`, but I want to keep the doors open for later.\n\nDuring the bootstrap of the application I'm using an app initializer to get some data via HTTP. The website cannot run without it (think of getting different configurations from an API depending on the hostname), so it makes sense to get the data as soon as possible and assume the website always runs with a preloaded configuration. \n\nWhen I use [Angular SSR](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr) my builds works as expected.\nWhen I sure [Angular Hybrid SSR](https://angular.dev/guide/hybrid-rendering) my build hangs because it tries to make a request to the API which is not available on the build server. \n\nThe configuration for Hybrid SSR is:\n\n```\n// angular.json\n\"outputMode\": \"server\"\n\n// app.routes.server.ts\nexport const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [\n  {\n    path: '**',\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n  }\n];\n```\n\nAs you can see, there's no pre-rendering involved. \n\nI want to use Hybrid SSR because it makes use of the same request handler during development where the normal SSR uses its own internal SSR middleware. Using the same handler seems more error-proof to me.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nFor both examples make sure to have Angular 19 installed.\n\n#### Example with Angular SSR\n\n1. `ng new v19ssr --ssr`\n2. In `app.config.ts` add an app initializer: `provideAppInitializer(() => console.log('Hello'))`\n3. In `angular.json` change the existing `prerender` to `false`.\n4. Run `ng build`\n\nObserve, that there is no `Hello` in your console.\nThis is as it should be.\n\n#### Example with Angular Hybrid SSR\n\n1. `ng new v19ssrSR --ssr --server-routing`\n2. In `app.config.ts` add an app initializer: `provideAppInitializer(() => console.log('Hello'))`\n3. In `app.routes.server.ts` switch the render mode to `Server`\n4. In `angular.json` change the `outputMode` to `server`\n5. Run `ng build`\n\nObserve, that there is `Hello` in your console, so the whole app has been boostrapped even when there is no route to prerender.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28921","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Hybrid rendering without any pre-rendered routes should not execute application bootstrapping\" (#28921)"},{"Id":"2678916333","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T13:57:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28918","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): adjust code to propagate errors from Piscina","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure that errors occurring during initialization are properly propagated, as Piscina currently swallows errors during worker initialization.

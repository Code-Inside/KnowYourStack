If you are using the \"ng add @angular/localize\" command, then I guess it does all the necessary steps. Though, the command did not add anything to polyfills, it just added types to \"tsconfig.app.json\" and \"tsconfig.spec.json\" file.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that, if you want to migrate your existing Angular 14 project to Angular 15 and remove \"polyfills.ts\" file, there is no info, how I should add localize package to project. I tried to run \"ng add @angular/localize\"  but I just got message \"Skipping installation: Package already installed. Nothing to be done.\" I tried to uninstall the package first and then add it, but that did no help. I guess it's because I have dependency that needs this package and has it already installed.\r\n\r\nI tried to consult first page https://angular.io/api/localize but it also just says to use same command.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-add-package\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n1.

Cause i got nothing about this from the Doc.\r\n\r\nI aslo reproduce the mental model from my [repo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rgv5yv?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponents%2Finspector.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcomponents%2Fapp-child.component.ts,src%2Findex.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts). > Since 🐳 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it should be invisible to the projected content?\r\n\r\n```\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\"🐳\")>\r\n    <app-child>\r\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\"🐶\")>\r\n        <div class=\"container\">\r\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\r\n          <app-inspector @Inject animal=>\"🐳\">\r\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\r\n          </app-inspector>\r\n        </div>\r\n  \r\n      </#VIEW>\r\n      <app-inspector>\r\n        <#VIEW>\r\n          <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\r\n        </#VIEW>\r\n      </app-inspector>\r\n    </app-child>\r\n  </#VIEW>\r\n</app-root>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter this, i read the [code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/74258f3652eff268c7599c0f71baf929ed5b244b/packages/core/src/render3/di.ts#L529), `canAccessViewProviders` is false when DI process in `ChildComponent` while true in `AppComponent`.\r\n\r\nSo, at least, the doc should say that `the dog 🐶 is only invisible to its own projected content` like this. \r\n\r\nIt's really fuzzy to me to make a clear understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#providers-vs-viewproviders\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nHow `viewProviders` dealing with this projected content?\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n- There is a lack of clear definition and demos about how `viewProviders` worked with `ng-content` in different circumstances\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\n- Make a specific defination about how `viewProviders` dealing with projected content.\r\n- Supply more examples to demonstrate them in kinds of circumstances.\r\n- Make a specific answer about whether it is reasonable that the children projected content should access the parent `viewProviders`. \r\n\r\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\r\n\r\n```true\r\nno\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49202","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unclear demonstration about viewProviders dealing with projected content\" (#49202)"},{"Id":"1599447533","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-25T00:39:01","Actor":"tanoabeleyra","Number":"49201","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): invalid ImageKit transformation","State":"open","Body":"`q-auto` is an invalid/unsupported transformation and should not be used\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is probably a little tricky, since this is exactly what should happen from within the same library, so we don't end up with the library importing itself.\r\n- The migration seems to break as soon as a library is added to the projects folder via `ng add` (so inside a non NX workspace)\r\n\r\nI've created a repo reflecting all the mentioned issues above.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/TomTomB/ng-sa-migration-issues\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n(none)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.0.5\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    15.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.5\r\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49193","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Standalone migration fails in various cases\" (#49193)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1600141156","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-26T17:50:55","Actor":"ciriousjoker","Number":"24784","RawContent":null,"Title":"`ng add @nguniversal/express-engine` fails in a project without an `app.module.ts`","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nadd\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTried to set up a fully standalone project with ssr, but `ng add` fails.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. `ng new repro-angular-ssr --minimal --skip-tests --strict --style css --inline-template --inline-style`\r\n2. `ng generate @angular/core:standalone` (selected bootstrap at path `./`)\r\n\r\n**This now fails:**\r\n\r\n`ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --verbose`\r\n\r\n**Repo:**\r\nhttps://github.com/ciriousjoker/repro-angular-ssr\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nℹ Using package manager: npm\r\n⠋ Searching for compatible package version...Locating potential npmrc files:\r\n✔ Found compatible package version: @nguniversal/express-engine@15.2.0.\r\n✔ Package information loaded.\r\n\r\nThe package @nguniversal/express-engine@15.2.0 will be installed and executed.\r\nWould you like to proceed?

I don't understand why these warnings are different.**\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.10\r\nNode: 16.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.10\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24783","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"There are inconsistent and confusing postcss/autoprefixer warnings from \"styles\" in angular.json\" (#24783)"},{"Id":"1599591741","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-25T07:13:14","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24782","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.2.5","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.2.4` -> `v2.2.5` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.5`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.5)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The unit tests run can run in either Chrome or jsdom. I need jsdom because my CI environment doesn't have Chrome (org policy: no browsers on servers).\r\n\r\nAngular CLI 15.1.4 introduced a change in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24620 wherein Javascript bundles are loaded as modules. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, jsdom doesn't support <script type=\"module\">; it simply doesn't load the module scripts. This is a known issue in jsdom - https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2475\r\n\r\nIdeally jsdom would add module support; but since that ticket has been open for four years, I'm not holding out much hope. So instead, here's my request:\r\n\r\n**REQUEST:** Could Angular CLI add a flag to add/omit type=\"module\" ?\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is patching jsdom (using patch-package) to ignore the type attribute on <script type=\"module\">.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nClone my git repo: https://github.com/andrewpmontgomery/angular-15-jsdom\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n2. Run `npm run test:chrome` and all three tests should pass.\r\n3. Run `npm run test:jsdom` and it should time-out.\r\n4. Run `npm run patch-package`\r\n5. Run `npm run test:jsdom` again and now it works.\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.2.0\r\nNode: 16.19.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24778","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI 15.1.4 breaks ng test with jsdom because CLI is loading JavaScript bundles as module\" (#24778)"},{"Id":"1598710153","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T14:43:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24777","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: refactor circular-deps-test.conf to use package.js file","State":"closed","Body":"This ensures that all packages are picked up.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24777","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: refactor circular-deps-test.conf to use package.js file\" (#24777)"},{"Id":"1598471575","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T11:46:35","Actor":"ziedzayani","Number":"24775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standalone migration failed with basic application","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI created a new application with Angular CLI 15.2.0.

Under the hood, this mostly rerenders the Angular application from scratch, which is better than a full page reload, but could definitely be improved. @alan-agius4 has suggested a number of opportunities for improving HMR. Most importantly, our strategy here should be to optimize the turnaround time for any given change _scaled_ with the frequency of that kind of change. For example, it is very common to make numerous tiny adjustments to CSS in quick succession while finding the precise styling needed for a page. This is a very hot path to optimize and even marginal improvements here can have a bit impact due to how frequently CSS-only changes are made during development.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSome ideas to improve HMR include (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n* Fast track CSS-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * This should be relatively straightforward since we mostly need to correlate a component class with its `<style />` tag on the page, then delete and recreate that tag with the new CSS content. This would be very fast and maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline styles is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Fast track Angular template-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * In theory, we just need to delete the generated JavaScript render functions for a component and overwrite them with the new render functions from the modified template, then re-apply the DOM.\r\n    * In practice, I think this is a challenge as Angular templates aren't completely stateless (ex. `async` pipe). But this is likely achievable in some capacity. Should be pretty quick and mostly maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline templates is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Re-render only the currently displayed Angular route, rather than the full application.\r\n    * Statistically speaking, most code changes will be within the currently displayed Angular route and won't impact anything outside the route. In many cases, it would be sufficient to just rerender that one route.\r\n\r\nAngular template and CSS changes in particular are two areas where users frequently make a large number of small changes in quick succession and in a manner which is easy for tooling to reason about. These are two spaces where we can have a huge impact on developer's quality of life.\r\n\r\nIf we can get this good enough, I'd love to get to a place where we could turn `--hmr` on by default in `ng serve`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHMR is mostly one facet of the larger problem around \"How do we make the time between editing a file and reloading its changes in the browser as quick as possible?\" (edit/refresh time). HMR is one means of getting built changes into the running browser faster and maintain the application's current state. We should (and are) investigating ways to improve the overall edit/refresh experience independent of HMR.\r\n\r\nMore related to HMR, the focus on Angular template and CSS changes does highlight a lack of focus on TypeScript changes. This is somewhat intentional. Angular has strong separation of concerns between Angular templates (for HTML/DOM rendering), CSS (for styling), and TypeScript (for component functionality). While this isn't absolute and TypeScript can often containing rendering or styling functionality (ex. list filters or conditional CSS classes), the vast majority of DOM and CSS changes made by a developer will be done by editing a template or a stylesheet, not TypeScript.\r\n\r\nTypeScript changes are also very tricky to apply consistently with HMR. As one example, renaming a class field in TypeScript _can_ be HMR'd, however doing so often leads to inconsistencies and confusing behavior. HMR is intended to maintain the current user state, but it is effectively impossible for the build process to understand that deleting a `foo` field and creating a `bar` field as intended as a rename and state should be transferred from one property to the other during HMR. At runtime, it looks like this renamed field just \"forgot\" all its state, which can easily break the component and cause errors which require a full page reload to fix. That's one example, but the sheer variety of possible changes a user can make to TypeScript code means it can never be totally consistent or reliable.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely be open to improvements here where we can take advantage of them, and we should make sure not to let \"perfect\" be the enemy of \"good enough\". The key takeaway here is that HMR of TypeScript-only changes in Angular is simultaneously the hardest to do right, and also the least impactful. Again, _scaling_ the impact of optimizing a particular change with the _frequency_ that kind of change occurs is where we can find the most value for users.\r\n\r\n/cc @alan-agius4 for other ideas around improving HMR, definitely lots of cool stuff we're hoping to do here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Hot Module Replacement (HMR)\" (#24755)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1600134272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-26T17:26:48","Actor":"oleal","Number":"26695","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(slider): vertical slider","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nslider seems to be only horizontal\r\n\r\nfor material for angular js, a \"vertical\" property existed for mat-slider\n\n### Use Case\n\nchose orientation for mat-slider","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26695","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(slider): vertical slider\" (#26695)"},{"Id":"1599966335","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-26T10:22:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26694","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to Angular 16","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps up the dev dependencies to Angular 16.0.0-next.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26694","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to Angular 16\" (#26694)"},{"Id":"1596681649","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-26T10:21:55","Actor":"RobinBomkamp","Number":"26685","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-snackbar): Snackbar line breaks are not alligned correctly (only Safari)","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1301\" alt=\"test\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49171265/220893651-9d74938b-e6de-42e8-9a35-bf4f47733e70.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis image shows that the second line of the snackbar is misaligned.

We'd like to upgrade to Angular v15 without migrating to the latest Angular Material MDC components at this time. When using the legacy imports on V15, the spinner animation doesn't activate. If I use the latest imports in Material v15, the spinner animation works ok. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. I've created a project on GitHub to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/fearghalom/angular15_material_issue.git\r\n2. I've defined a custom theme\r\n3. I've created a simple app with two buttons. One is a mat-raised-button (legacy) and the other is a simple HTML button. \r\n4.  Clicking on a button should show the spinner animation but it only works on the simple HTML button. \r\n5. If i change from the legacy Material imports to the latest, the spinner on the mat button works ok. \r\n6. I did some investigation and found that commenting out a line in _node_modules/@angular/material/core/focus-indicators/_private.scss_ , resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use 'sass:meta';\r\n@use '@angular/cdk';\r\n@use '../style/layout-common';\r\n@use '../theming/theming';\r\n\r\n// Private sass variables that will be used as reference throughout component stylesheets.\r\n$default-border-width: 3px;\r\n$default-border-style: solid;\r\n$default-border-color: transparent;\r\n$default-border-radius: 4px;\r\n\r\n// Mixin that renders the focus indicator structural styles.\r\n@mixin structural-styling($prefix) {\r\n  .#{$prefix}-focus-indicator {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n\r\n    &::before {\r\n      @include layout-common.fill();\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n      pointer-events: none;\r\n      //display: var(--#{$prefix}-focus-indicator-display, none);  !!!!

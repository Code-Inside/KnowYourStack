`CommonEngine` causes an error `ENOENT: no such file or directory ... vite-root/<project>/index.server.html`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nThe scaffolding for Angular 19's `server.ts` uses the new `AngularNodeAppEngine`  which unlike `CommonEngine`, does not expose a way to add `providers` albeit not working as intended on Angular 18 for `ng serve` (Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26323)).\n\nI have modified the new default `server.ts` to retain the new more \"modular\" approach and still use the the `createNodeRequestHandler` which I believe is required for the `dev-server` to pass the `isSsrNodeRequestHandler(reqHandler)` condition. \n\nHere is the `server.ts` with the rest of the project built with the default/scaffolding of `ng new`:\n```typescript\nimport { APP_BASE_HREF } from '@angular/common';\nimport { CommonEngine, createNodeRequestHandler, isMainModule } from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport { REQUEST as SSR_REQUEST } from 'ngx-cookie-service-ssr';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport { dirname, join, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport bootstrap from './src/main.server';\n\nconsole.log('RUNNING server.ts')\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\nconst indexHtml = join(serverDistFolder, 'index.server.html');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst commonEngine = new CommonEngine();\n\n/**\n * Example Express Rest API endpoints can be defined here.\n * Uncomment and define endpoints as necessary.\n *\n * Example:\n * ```ts\n * app.get('/api/**', (req, res) => {\n *   // Handle API request\n * });\n * ```\n */\n\napp.get('/api/**', (req, res) => {\n  console.log('API CALLED', req.originalUrl);\n  res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }));\n});\n\n/**\n * Serve static files from /browser\n */\napp.get(\n  '**',\n  express.static(browserDistFolder, {\n    maxAge: '1y',\n    index: 'index.html'\n  }),\n);\n\n/**\n * Handle all other requests by rendering the Angular application.\n */\napp.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\n  const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\n\n  commonEngine\n    .render({\n      bootstrap,\n      documentFilePath: indexHtml,\n      url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\n      publicPath: browserDistFolder,\n      providers: [\n        { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl },\n        // BUG: https://github.com/stevermeister/ngx-cookie-service/issues/326\n        // https://github.com/stevermeister/ngx-cookie-service?tab=readme-ov-file#server-side-rendering\n        { provide: SSR_REQUEST, useValue: req },\n        { provide: 'REQUEST', useValue: req },\n        { provide: 'RESPONSE', useValue: res },\n        { provide: 'TEST', useValue: 'TEST VALUE' },\n      ],\n    })\n    .then((html) => res.send(html))\n    .catch((err) => next(err));\n});\n\n/**\n * Start the server if this module is the main entry point.\n * The server listens on the port defined by the `PORT` environment variable, or defaults to 4000.\n */\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n  const port = process.env['PORT'] || 4000;\n  app.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n  });\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n```\n\n### Why?\nI need to add custom providers from express server downstream to the angular app. I also believe there is an [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79246059/angular-19-request-is-null-on-server-runtime-even-with-rendermode-server-and?noredirect=1#comment139740641_79246059) with new `REQUEST` injection in Angular 19 so I had to do it myself.\n\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open

Let me know, if that's good. Currently, all `{@example}`-s are being targeted by the script and then replaced with the respective code example wrapped in a Markdown code block.\r\n\r\nThe extractor/parser supports various `#docregion` use variations that can be checked in the unit tests. It is still possible that I missed a use case but these are based on the different examples that I explored during the implementation.\r\n\r\nIt is _**important**_ to note that there are about half a dozen examples that are still missing because of the `<code-example>` usage. Some of the instances have already been replaced with `{@example}` – those that have only a `region` parameter (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59004/commits/a63b52477af5f3d3adf0b3a8bec2a91db99ca6e2). The remaining instances are left because they contain a `header` param. All that being said, I want to start a discussion in that regard – should we get rid of `<code-example>` completely in favor of `{@example}` or vice versa? Obviously, there are other details that have to be taken into account like whether the output of this interpolation mechanism should produce Markdown or HTML but this is something that can be decided as a secondary thing.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59004","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): fix missing code examples in the API reference\" (#59004)"},{"Id":"2710951935","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-02T10:33:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58997","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(platform-server): remove peer dependency on animations","State":"closed","Body":"The `@angular/platform-server` package had a peer dependency on `@angular/animations` which wasn't being used anywhere.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58997","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(platform-server): remove peer dependency on animations\" (#58997)"},{"Id":"2711385599","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-02T10:31:59","Actor":"SashaKumeiko","Number":"59003","RawContent":null,"Title":"Styles for a css chunk applied with delay.

resolve of data","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nrouter\n\n### Description\n\nFor my app I need to fetch data and I like to do this in my Router config, using Route Resolver functions.\nI prefer to load my core data via a resolver in the root, in a blocking way because it is required to render the home page.\nHowever, some other data may be resolved in a lazy fashion.\nCurrently, I can't do that in a Route resolver, I have to load it as part of a (container/page) component (either via effects or in the ngOninit).\n\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCan we expand on the resolver config to allow for an Options object to be added so we can tell the Router to load the data blocking or non blocking?\n```\n{\n    path: '',\n    component: AuthenticatedLayoutComponent,\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard],\n    data: {\n      resolveAsync: ['tvs']\n    },\n    resolve: {\n      facility: facilityResolver,\n      resident: residentResolver,\n      calenderEvents: CalendarEventsResolver,\n      tvs: tvsResolver({ runAsync: true } ),                <======== Change\n      homeCards: HomeCardsResolver,\n      whoIsListening: whoIsListeningResolver,\n    },\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nSo I did a little work around, so I can configure my resolver to load async or sync:\n```\n// ROUTE SEGMENT\n{\n    path: '',\n    component: AuthenticatedLayoutComponent,\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard],\n    data: {\n      resolveAsync: ['tvs']\n    },\n    resolve: {\n      facility: facilityResolver,\n      resident: residentResolver,\n      calenderEvents: CalendarEventsResolver,\n      tvs: tvsResolver,\n      homeCards: HomeCardsResolver,\n      whoIsListening: whoIsListeningResolver,\n    },\n```\nI used `data` to pass in a variable to tell my `tvsResolver` if it should load sync or async.\n\nThen in the resolver:\n```\nexport const tvsResolver: ResolveFn<any> =\n  // (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => {\n  (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => {\n    const loadAsync = Array.isArray(route.data.resolveAsync) && route.data.resolveAsync.includes('tvs');\n\n   ....\n  if (loadAsync) {\n     // load Non Blocking\n      const sub: Subscription = deviceService.getTvs().subscribe(() => sub.unsubscribe());\n  } else {\n     // load Blocking\n     return deviceService.getTvs();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever I think this could be done in a better way configuring this in the Router segment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58987","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Route Resolvers: allow for async (non blocking) resolve of data\"

URL segments with i18n","State":"open","Body":"Previously, the `baseHref` option under each locale allowed for generating a unique base href for specific locales. However, users were still required to handle file organization manually, and `baseHref` appeared to be primarily designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new `urlSegment` option, which simplifies the i18n process, particularly in static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR). When the `urlSegment` option is used, the `baseHref` is ignored. Instead, the `urlSegment` serves as both the base href and the name of the directory containing the localized version of the app.\r\n\r\n### Configuration Example\r\n\r\nBelow is an example configuration showcasing the use of `urlSegment`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"i18n\": {\r\n  \"sourceLocale\": {\r\n    \"code\": \"en-US\",\r\n    \"urlSegment\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"locales\": {\r\n

\"src/i18n/messages.de-BE.xlf\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Directory Structure\r\n\r\nThe following tree structure demonstrates how the `urlSegment` organizes localized build output:\r\n```\r\ndist/\r\n├── app/\r\n│   └── browser/  # Default locale, accessible at `/`\r\n│       ├── fr/  # Locale for `fr-BE`, accessible at `/fr`\r\n│       └── de/  # Locale for `de-BE`,

Except if that request happens to respond with a 204 and no body.\n\nCURLing to the backend directly delivers the following:\n```\n[...request omitted...]\n> content-length: 23\n>\n* We are completely uploaded and fine\n* [CONN-0-0][CF-SSL] TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\n* [CONN-0-0][CF-SSL] TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\n* old SSL session ID is stale, removing\n* Connection state changed (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS == 128)!\n< HTTP/2 204 \n< date: Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:52:15 GMT\n< vary: Accept-Language, Cookie\n< content-language: de\n< x-content-type-options: nosniff\n< referrer-policy: same-origin\n< x-frame-options: DENY\n< set-cookie: language=de; Path=/; Secure\n< set-cookie: ###REDACTED###\n< strict-transport-security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains\n<\n* Connection #0 to host ###REDACTED### left intact\n```\n\nThe same request to the angular proxy on localhost:\n```\n[...request omitted...same as above]\n> Content-Length: 23\n>\n```\n\n...and that's it. i do control the backend somewhat, so i changed my response to a 200 with json encoded \"OK\" as answer. That works with the proxy:\n```\n[...request omitted...same as above]\n> Content-Length: 23\n>\n* [CONN-0-0][CF-SSL] TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\n* [CONN-0-0][CF-SSL] TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\n* old SSL session ID is stale, removing\n* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< X-Powered-By: Express\n< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n< date: Fri, 29 Nov 2024 14:06:47 GMT\n< content-type: application/json\n< content-length: 4\n< connection: close\n< vary: Accept-Language, Cookie\n< content-language: de\n< x-content-type-options: nosniff\n< referrer-policy: same-origin\n< x-frame-options: DENY\n< set-cookie: language=de; Path=/; Secure\n< set-cookie: ###REDACTED###\n< strict-transport-security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains\n<\n\"OK\"* Closing connection 0\n```\n\njust for completeness, the only difference i see in the server response for the 200 are these 4 headers:\n```\n< content-type: application/json\n< content-length: 4\n< vary: Accept-Language, Cookie\n< content-language: de\n```\nthese are present in the 200 answer, but not the 204 answer (which makes sense, because there is no body). Apparently, the angular proxy is waiting for these headers to be sent, but never receives them and is thus stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nSince 204s are rather common for DELETE statements (in this case it's a POST, but the same happens with DELETE and any other method), it would be nice if this issue could be addressed.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker, upgrade\n\nPackage                            Version\n------------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core               18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics         18.2.12\n@angular/cdk                       18.2.14\n@angular/cli                       18.2.12\n@angular/flex-layout               15.0.0-beta.42\n@angular/material                  18.2.14\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   18.2.14\n@schematics/angular                18.2.12\nrxjs                               7.8.1\ntypescript                         5.5.4\nzone.js                            0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI Can't really pinpoint which update introduced this issue, we recently updated from angular-16 to 18.

With Angular v 18.0.4, all worked fine.\n\nI updated to Angular 19.0.x. Everything works fine in local environment. But when deployed, I can access to the root page (probably served by Nginx or Apache) and I can navigate to other pages in client side. But I get a timeout when requesting another page from server side. The node application is not listening for incoming requests.\n\nThe problem comes from the `isMainModule(url)` function, that test the first argument on the command line. I do not launch myself the node server, it is launch with Phusion Passenger. Perhaps it adds some other arguments to the command line.\n\nI bypassed the test `argv[1] === fileURLToPath(url)` with a local variable `process.env['RUN']` set in dev and production environnements. It allow to build without error (because I do not pass this variable when building) and when executing the server it now listen for requests.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular v19 project, with SSR, and a route to a component (/ssr for example).\nDeploy to a server with Phusion Passenger configurated to launch a node application.\nGo to the route /ssr and wait for the timeout to occur.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.2\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.2\n@schematics/angular             19.0.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28993","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SSR isMainModule function return false when node app server is launched by Phusion Passenger\" (#28993)"},{"Id":"2703163068","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T20:28:20","Actor":"sedghi","Number":"28994","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebWorkers problem in Angular related to Vite `optimizeDeps`","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe have a [library](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/) that utilizes web workers.

I tried customizing Vite but faced a limitation, as there is no way to override `optimizeDeps` in Angular, as noted [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26859).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b101e1de-a645-4248-9e89-196cd3a04aa7)\nIn some threads, I see that setting \n\n```\n\"cli\": {\n    \"cache\": {\n      \"enabled\": false\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nremoves the warning above, but then the worker is requested from an incorrect path.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22786cdf-ae02-4c19-9a6a-c0fed89da210)\n\nI also have tried the following \n\n```js\n\"development\": {\n        \"buildTarget\": \"angular-vite-6:build:development\",\n        \"prebundle\": false\n}\n```\n\nstill no success\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nThis is basically minimal repo for reproduction \n- https://github.com/cornerstonejs/angular-cornerstone3d\n\n\ncommands to run \n\n```\nnpm i \n\nnpm run start\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nWith the cache enabled, the Vite warning appears, and disabling the cache loads the worker from the wrong path.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 18.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.1\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.2\n@schematics/angular             19.0.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI want to emphasize that other Vite-based implementations for [Vue](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vue-cornerstone3d), [React](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/vite-react-cornerstone3d), and [Quasar](https://github.com/sedghi/quasar-cornerstone3D) work, so it's only Angular that's not working.\n\nIn addition, the `npm run build` also does not work and tries to load the worker from a wrong path (Again the build with vite, and webpack works)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bd562aa-a0bf-46cf-ac49-0146c67c769d)\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebWorkers problem in Angular related to Vite `optimizeDeps`\" (#28994)"},{"Id":"2700777179","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T07:39:08","Actor":"saikatmahapatra","Number":"28988","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI is hiding files from system but codebase is running","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ngenerate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhile I was creating a new module with routing, noticed that existing modules are vanished from file explorer and VS code also.

They only show up when I scroll, and even then, the dropdown does not disappear properly.\n\nAs you can see in the video below, there's a white vertical bar at the top of the page, and I believe the issue is related to the cdk-overlay-container.

I'm not sure if StackBlitz would support all the dependencies and configurations I've used in this project. However, I can provide any additional details or code snippets to help the team reliably reproduce the issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected the mat-select options to appear correctly when an item is selected. The dropdown should display the mat-options immediately without the need for scrolling, and the dropdown should close properly once an option is selected. There should be no unexpected visual artifacts, such as the white vertical bar at the top of the page.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen selecting an item from the mat-select, the mat-options do not appear immediately. They only become visible after scrolling, and even then, the dropdown does not close properly. Additionally, a white vertical bar appears at the top of the page, which I believe is related to the cdk-overlay-container.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: **18.2.0**\n- CDK/Material: **18.2.14**\n- Browser(s): \n   - **Brave** _Version 1.73.91 Chromium: 131.0.6778.85 (64-bit)_\n   - **Chrome** _Version 131.0.6778.85 (Official Build) (64-bit)_\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): **Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS**\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30112","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Problem with mat-select in MFE: Options not displaying correctly inside cdk-overlay-container\" (#30112)"},{"Id":"2708941881","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-01T10:38:18","Actor":"xylplm","Number":"30111","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): cdkDragHandle not work in mat-table td","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nMy table rows can be dragged.

On iOS, the thumb position is not updated when the finger touches down on the screen (i.e. \"touchstart\" event) if the track is touched. To move the thumb, a drag must start on the thumb itself. This makes it hard for users to drag the slider since they need to very precisely touch the thumb. However, if a pointer drag event starts on slider track (from a mouse or touchpad), then the thumb moves appropriately (i.e. mousedown or pointerdown event).\n\nWe've had several complains from our users on this topic and this is becoming a major issue for us. The sliders worked perfectly in version 15.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nA specific StackBlitz is not necessary as the behavor can be reproduced from https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use Safari or Chrome on iOS and go to: https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview\n2. Using finger on touchscreen, drag the track of any of the sliders. The thumb does not move despite the ripple effect being triggered.\n3. Use a mouse or a touchpad to drag the track of any slider. The thumb moves with the drag.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe thumb position should update on touchstart event on the track. If you use v15.2.9 of the Angular material components (https://v15.material.angular.io/components/slider/overview), the dragging behavior works perfectly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iOS, the thumb position is not updated on touchstart event if the track is touched. To move the thumb, a drag must start on the thumb itself. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.0 to 19.0.0\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.0 to 19.0.0\n- Browser(s): Safari or Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): iOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30102","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-slider): Slider thumb cannot be moved by dragging the track on iOS\" (#30102)"},{"Id":"2701213492","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T12:06:25","Actor":"tjaz-brelih","Number":"30098","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Ripple): Styling documentation tab doesn't load","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nWhen navigating to the Styling tab for Ripple component the tab content only says Loading.\nHTTP request for URL `https://material.angular.io/docs-content/tokens/material/ripple/ripple.json` returns a generic Firebase \"Page Not Found\" page with HTTP status 404.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/ripple/styling","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30098","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Ripple): Styling documentation tab doesn't load\" (#30098)"},{"Id":"2701771848","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T11:00:10","Actor":"endlacer","Number":"30101","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(drag-drop): New Optional Input [cdkDragStartPredicate]","State":"open","Body":"## Feature Request\n### Problem Statement\nCurrently, the CdkDrag directive doesn't provide a way to conditionally prevent drag operations from starting based on the initial mouse/touch event.

One has to specifically search for it, but when using Angular it's not clear that the patched (standard) APIs may be incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the linked issues it has been asked already why the patch is not included by default, but no answer has been given before the issues were locked automatically, hence I'm trying to reach out again to find some insights on this. The only hint I find in the docs are these lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2fc5b70fcedb8ac35b825b245c0ae394dc125244/packages/zone.js/NON-STANDARD-APIS.md?plain=1#L239-L242\r\n\r\nHowever these are clearly outdated, as all major browsers [support the API](https://caniuse.com/resizeobserver) nowadays. In fact, with the `resize` event potentially [not firing anymore for arbitrary elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event), the `ResizeObserver` is essential for responding to size changes, and I'd thus expect it to be quite common in use.\r\n\r\nWith the available information from the linked issues and the existing patch it should be fairly simple to enable this by default, and I can create a PR if desired. But I also wanted to verify if there is a reason for leaving it out intentionally before putting any work into it, or if it's just an oversight?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nzone-js 0.12.0, 0.11.8\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48890","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ResizeObserver should be patched automatically by zone.js\" (#48890)"},{"Id":"1563714458","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-31T06:06:25","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"48889","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.2.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | minor | `v2.1.39` -> `v2.2.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.1`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1)\n\n### [`v2.2.0`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.39...v2.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.39...v2.2.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After the upgrade, I noticed that 'ng serve' incremental build times had increased from around (15s - 25s) on Angular v12 to (115s - 130s) on Angular v15. This kind of degradation in build performance was not expected.  Here are my settings in the angular.json file for our 'development' config. \r\n\r\n  \"development\": {\r\n              \"buildOptimizer\": false,\r\n              \"optimization\": false,\r\n              \"vendorChunk\": true,\r\n              \"extractLicenses\": false,\r\n              \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n              \"namedChunks\": true,\r\n              \"aot\": false,\r\n              \"progress\": true\r\n            }\r\n\r\nI tried a number of thing to see if I could bring down the time. One that gave a limited improvement was to move the entries from the \"scripts\" section in the angular.json file and directly reference them in the index.html file via script tags instead.

You can now add the `const` modifier on a type parameter of a function, method, or class like this:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <const T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] });\n    ```\n\n    The type of `names` in the above example is `readonly [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"]`. Marking the type parameter as `const` behaves as if you had written `as const` at every use instead. The above code is equivalent to the following TypeScript, which was the only option before TypeScript 5.0:\n\n    ```ts\n    type HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };\n    const getNamesExactly = <T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T[\"names\"] => arg.names;\n    const names = getNamesExactly({ names: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Eve\"] } as const);\n    ```\n\n    You can read [the announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/#const-type-parameters) for more information.\n\n-   Make parsing generic `async` arrow functions more strict in `.tsx` files\n\n    Previously esbuild's TypeScript parser incorrectly accepted the following code as valid:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T> () => {};\n    ```\n\n    The official TypeScript parser rejects this code because it thinks it's the identifier `async` followed by a JSX element starting with `<T>`. So with this release, esbuild will now reject this syntax in `.tsx` files too. You'll now have to add a comma after the type parameter to get generic arrow functions like this to parse in `.tsx` files:\n\n    ```tsx\n    let fn = async <T,> () => {};\n    ```\n\n-   Allow the `in` and `out` type parameter modifiers on class expressions\n\n    TypeScript 4.7 added the `in` and `out` modifiers on the type parameters of classes, interfaces, and type aliases. However, while TypeScript supported them on both class expressions and class statements, previously esbuild only supported them on class statements due to an oversight. This release now allows these modifiers on class expressions too:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare let Foo: any;\n    Foo = class <in T> { };\n    Foo = class <out T> { };\n    ```\n\n-   Update `enum` constant folding for TypeScript 5.0\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 contains an [updated definition of what it considers a constant expression](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/50528):\n\n    > An expression is considered a *constant expression* if it is\n    >\n    > -   a number or string literal,\n    > -   a unary `+`, `-`, or `~` applied to a numeric constant expression,\n    > -   a binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `|`, `&`, `^` applied to two numeric constant expressions,\n    > -   a binary `+` applied to two constant expressions whereof at least one is a string,\n    > -   a template expression where each substitution expression is a constant expression,\n    > -   a parenthesized constant expression,\n    > -   a dotted name (e.g. `x.y.z`) that references a `const` variable with a constant expression initializer and no type annotation,\n    > -   a dotted name that references an enum member with an enum literal type, or\n    > -   a dotted name indexed by a string literal (e.g. `x.y[\"z\"]`) that references an enum member with an enum literal type.\n\n    This impacts esbuild's implementation of TypeScript's `const enum` feature. With this release, esbuild will now attempt to follow these new rules. For example, you can now initialize an `enum` member with a template literal expression that contains a numeric constant:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original input\n    const enum Example {\n      COUNT = 100,\n      ERROR = `Expected ${COUNT} items`,\n    }\n    console.log(\n      Example.COUNT,\n      Example.ERROR,\n    )\n\n    // Old output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    var Example = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Example2) => {\n      Example2[Example2[\"COUNT\"] = 100] = \"COUNT\";\n      Example2[Example2[\"ERROR\"] = `Expected ${100 /* COUNT */} items`] = \"ERROR\";\n      return Example2;\n    })(Example || {});\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      Example.ERROR\n    );\n\n    // New output (with --tree-shaking=true)\n    console.log(\n      100 /* COUNT */,\n      \"Expected 100 items\" /* ERROR */\n    );\n    ```\n\n    These rules are not followed exactly due to esbuild's limitations. The rule about dotted references to `const` variables is not followed both because esbuild's enum processing is done in an isolated module setting and because doing so would potentially require esbuild to use a type system, which it doesn't have. For example:\n\n    ```ts\n    // The TypeScript compiler inlines this but esbuild doesn't:\n    declare const x = 'foo'\n    const enum Foo { X = x }\n    console.log(Foo.X)\n    ```\n\n    Also, the rule that requires converting numbers to a string currently only followed for 32-bit signed integers and non-finite numbers. This is done to avoid accidentally introducing a bug if esbuild's number-to-string operation doesn't exactly match the behavior of a real JavaScript VM. Currently esbuild's number-to-string constant folding is conservative for safety.\n\n-   Forbid definite assignment assertion operators on class methods\n\n    In TypeScript, class methods can use the `?` optional property operator but not the `!` definite assignment assertion operator (while class fields can use both):\n\n    ```ts\n    class Foo {\n      // These are valid TypeScript\n      a?\n      b!\n      x?() {}\n\n      // This is invalid TypeScript\n      y!() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild incorrectly allowed the definite assignment assertion operator with class methods. This will no longer be allowed starting with this release.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.33.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.33.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.32.0...v8.33.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`2cc7954`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2cc7954cdb1fed44e8a5d3c9b3ea1deceadb5e00) feat: add `restrictDefaultExports` option to no-restricted-exports rule ([#&#8203;16785](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16785)) (Nitin Kumar)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`17f4be2`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/17f4be2b66deb81f4e9ffb3d6bdfb79f3fcf85a2) docs: Fix examples in no-multiple-empty-lines rule ([#&#8203;16835](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16835)) (jonz94)\n-   [`9c7cfe3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9c7cfe33c4a39cf2c23529afe02030ea7f8acf70) docs: 'Source Code' content in 'Set up Development Environment' page ([#&#8203;16780](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16780)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ede5c64`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ede5c6475469a905da4f559ab55f0ee73168a9d7) docs: Custom processors page ([#&#8203;16802](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16802)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`2620614`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2620614f525de13f2e3ab0a7cd92abe89dae4897) docs: Code of Conduct page ([#&#8203;16781](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16781)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`50a8efd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/50a8efd957c70c9978a8ed25744a24193b00e078) docs: report a sec vulnerability page ([#&#8203;16808](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16808)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`ed60afd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ed60afd4450e769a975447178299446f4439d926) docs: Update page titles, section landing pages, and side TOC ([#&#8203;16760](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16760)) (Ben Perlmutter)\n-   [`333c712`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/333c71243537966930e9ab8178bc98c37949b5f2) docs: add background to code-path-diagrams for dark-mode ([#&#8203;16822](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16822)) (Tanuj Kanti)\n-   [`f5f7b9b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f5f7b9b8b512f5c6a5b4a1037f81bb3f5a7311e0) docs: Update README (GitHub Actions Bot)\n-   [`2aa4f5f`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2aa4f5fb2fdb1c4a1734093c225e5c6251b0ee0f) docs: no-constant-condition: Add multi-comparison example ([#&#8203;16776](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16776)) (Sebastian Simon)\n-   [`40287db`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/40287dbe7407934a69805f02ece07491778c3694) docs: Remove Google Group icon ([#&#8203;16779](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16779)) (Nicholas C.

See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+import.meta.url+\r\n\r\nThis issue, which describes the problem well: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388 was closed bcause it's actually Webpack's fault and Webpack *used* to unconditionally rewrite `import.meta.url` to something useless in the absence of a loader.  But now we can stop Webpack from doing that, using the `parser.javascript.importMeta` option: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/15246\r\n\r\n... except that to do this in Angular requires a custom webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nSince we are not supposed to have webpack-specific configuration in the angular config, it would be nice if the default behaviour of Angular was non-broken.  Obviously it would have to be done while conserving the (arguably broken and inconsistent) policy of *sometimes* using loaders and *sometimes* not using them.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSomething about not being able to access local content\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.1.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\nwebpack                         5.75.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24616","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular should disable webpack's import.meta.url parsing by default\" (#24616)"},{"Id":"1559195931","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-27T05:22:47","Actor":"dhdaines","Number":"24617","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular should *not* disable Webpack's import.meta.url parsing (for WebAssembly files, at least)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nActually, Angular should just make up its h*cking mind (see #24616).\r\n\r\nCurrently, its mysterious and ephemeral built-in webpack configuration *disables* [module.parser.javascript.url](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascripturl), so assets imported with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` do not get packaged by default.\r\n\r\nOkay, that's fine, if you're into that kind of thing, but at the same time it keeps [module.parser.java.importmeta](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascriptimportmeta) enabled, leading webpack to output entirely useless `file://` URLs instead of doing any packaging.\r\n\r\nEnd result is that you just can't use any ES6 module (such as *anything* compiled with Emscripten's `EXPORT_ES6` option) that tries to load some possibly really important asset, like, say, a WebAssembly file.  You are damned if you do and damned if you don't!  If you do what is suggested in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22351 and try to use the `assets` option, the actually generated code will *not* reference this asset because `import.meta.url` got rewritten to some path on your build filesystem.\r\n\r\nBut if you then disable `module.parser.java.importmeta` manually in a custom webpack config, then you end up with `import.meta.url` in the output code, which utterly breaks testing with karma (since karma does not do ES6 modules, because that's like not groovy, man) and of course also any possibility of targeting a non-ES6-aware browser.\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of webpack's perfectly good and sane defaults.  A reasonable workaround is to create a custom webpack config which *enables* `module.parser.java.url`, like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  module: {\r\n    parser: {\r\n      javascript: {\r\n        url: true,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nFrom an Angular app, try to load an ES6 module (like https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundswallower?activeTab=explore) that has an accompanying WASM file, or any kind of asset that is loaded with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`.  The relevant code output by Emscripten is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n wasmBinaryFile = new URL(\"soundswallower.web.wasm\", import.meta.url).href;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No

doesn't seem to be the case. I was merging several observables together and making a query to my backend, and wanted to only reset the paginator's index to 0 only after my data had returned as long as the paginator did not trigger the query. I figured I could easily check if the emitted value was an `instanceof PageEvent` or not, but that doesn't seem to be the case. \r\n\r\nIs there a reason why this behavior is occurring other than being a possible bug? `PageEvent` is a `class` type, so I would have expected it to have been instantiated as such.\r\n\r\nI may also be fundamentally misunderstanding something, so please forgive me.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59396813/216065996-5841f94f-1592-4de5-a9ff-23628ebbe176.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is shown in this StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-9svfyb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpaginator-overview-example.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'paginator-overview-example',\r\n  templateUrl: 'paginator-overview-example.html',\r\n})\r\nexport class PaginatorOverviewExample implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  @ViewChild(MatPaginator) paginator: MatPaginator;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    this.paginator.page.subscribe((pageEvent: PageEvent) =>\r\n      console.log(\r\n        'pageEvent instanceof PageEvent',\r\n        pageEvent instanceof PageEvent // this returns false\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFor the page event to be an `instanceof PageEvent`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt is not an `instanceof PageEvent`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n(from stackblitz)\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"example-app\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"watch\": \"ng build --watch --configuration development\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"15.1.2\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"15.1.2\",\r\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"15.1.2\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"moment\": \"^2.18.1\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~7.4.0\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.11.5\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~15.0.0\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.10.0\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~3.10.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~6.3.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"~1.7.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.8.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26546","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatPaginator): page observable parameter is not an instanceof PageEvent\" (#26546)"},{"Id":"1566150186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-01T13:49:32","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26545","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/checkbox): focus not moved to input when clicking on touch target","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that while we were toggling the checked state of a checkbox when its touch target is clicked, we weren't moving focus to the internal `input`.\r\n\r\nFixes #26486.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26545","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/checkbox): focus not moved to input when clicking on touch target\" (#26545)"},{"Id":"1566131639","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-01T13:37:00","Actor":"sfinoteffy","Number":"26544","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(mat-select): Can't apply theme color because of MDC","State":"open","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\n\nTrying to apply theme color to the label of mat-select, but the color that is always applied is `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`\n\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\n\nI applied my color with a palette, following what the documentation says:\r\n`$theme: mat.define-light-theme((\r\n  color: (\r\n    primary: $app-primary,\r\n    accent: $app-accent,\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n`\r\nBut it doesn't seem to have any effect on the color of mat-select label which is always `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`.

The `CdkTable` calls the [updateStickyColumns()](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/sticky-styler.ts#L104) method of the `StickyStyler` correctly.\r\n2. The `StickyStyler` adds the task to the `CoalescedStyleReducer` [here](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/sticky-styler.ts#L134).\r\n3. In the `CoalescedStyleReducer` the [this._getScheduleObservable()](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/coalesced-style-scheduler.ts#L75) event is not emitted until I trigger the next change detection cycle, e.g. by clicking on the table.

content of the header tag in the HTML file is placed on a new line.\r\n\r\nWhen using a header tag that contains a long expression, the default formatting (by Prettier, for example) puts the content of the header tag on the next line (as header tags are block elements), like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<h2 mat-dialog-title>\r\n  {{ getTitleThisFunctionHasAVeryLongNameSoPrettierPutsItOnANewLine() }}\r\n</h2>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in a space being inserted in the HTML. However, since the browser ignores whitespace at the beginning of the element, the space is not visible (cf. HTML spec).\r\n\r\nSinde Material 15 however, elements containing `mat-dialog-title` have a `::before` element. This element causes the browser to render the whitespace, which is inconsistent with default browser behavior and default formatting for block elements.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

I was looking at ways to rework this and came to the conclusion that it would fit well within the `cdk/layout`.\r\n\r\nThe api for the `angular-container-media-query` library requires you to \"register\" a resize service:\r\n```\r\nimport {MediaQuery, ObserveResizeService} from 'angular-container-media-query';\r\n\r\n@Component({})\r\nexport class Component {\r\n  @MediaQuery('(max-width: 400px)') @HostBinding('class.small') small = false;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    resize: ObserveResizeService,\r\n    elementRef: ElementRef,\r\n    changeDetector: ChangeDetectorRef\r\n  ) {\r\n    resize.register(this, elementRef, changeDetector);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe api could more closely resemble the `BreakpointObserver`, but I'm not sure if that's possible:\r\n```\r\nimport {ComponentBreakpointObserver} from '@angular/cdk/layout';\r\n\r\n@Component({})\r\nexport class Component implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  @HostBinding('class.small') small = false;\r\n\r\n  small$ = this._componentBreakpointObserver.observe('(max-width: 400px)').pipe(\r\n    map(({matches}) => matches)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _componentBreakpointObserver: ComponentBreakpointObserver,\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.small$.pipe(takeUntil(this.destroyed)).subscribe((small) => this.small = small);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.destroyed.next();\r\n    this.destroyed.complete();\r\n  }\r\n```\n\n### Use Case\n\nWhen you use for example a sidenav the content area resizes based on the sidenav being open or closed. A component within that content will better respond to size changes based on the content area size (or its own size) instead of listening to the breakpoints on the viewport.\r\n\r\nI reused the dynamic sidenav example to show how the ContainerBreakpointObserver could work (and how it currently works with the `angular-container-media-query` library):\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-59mxnc\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7734728/216007576-83e7492b-a39d-488f-a34a-6a8a3707a886.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7734728/216007633-b87dbaa5-8737-4ee5-aeb4-861d3d13dd43.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26537","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdk/layout): Container breakpoint observer\" (#26537)"},{"Id":"1565277386","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-01T01:44:19","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26535","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): make valueChange emit only on change and not on…","State":"open","Body":"… input\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26496","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26535","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): make valueChange emit only on change and not on…\" (#26535)"},{"Id":"1564879723","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-31T21:17:10","Actor":"devversion","Number":"26530","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the dev-infra packages and accounts for breaking changes to stamping, linker/optimization.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26530","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update angular shared dev-infra code\" (#26530)"},{"Id":"1564955488","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-31T20:28:06","Actor":"pgschwendtner","Number":"26534","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update bazel setup [test3]","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@bazel/buildifier](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) | devDependencies | major | [`5.1.0` -> `6.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fbuildifier/5.1.0/6.0.1) |\n| [@bazel/concatjs](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fconcatjs/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/esbuild](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fesbuild/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fjasmine/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/protractor](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fprotractor/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/rollup](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2frollup/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/runfiles](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2frunfiles/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/terser](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fterser/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n| [@bazel/worker](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.7.2` -> `5.7.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fworker/5.7.2/5.7.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/buildtools</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases/tag/6.0.1): (2023-01-31)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/compare/6.0.0...6.0.1)\n\n-   `.buildifier.json` config file\n    -

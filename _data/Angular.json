Depending on the\r\n  specifics of application/test setup, this can result in them executing\r\n  earlier or later (or requiring additional test steps to trigger; see below\r\n  examples).\r\n\r\n* effects which are triggered during change detection (e.g. by input signals) run _earlier_, before the component's template.\r\n\r\nWe've seen a few common failure cases:\r\n\r\n* Tests which used to rely on the `Promise` timing of effects now need to `await whenStable()` or call `.detectChanges()` in order for effects to run.\r\n\r\n* Tests which use faked clocks may need to fast-forward/flush the clock to cause effects to run.\r\n\r\n* `effect()`s triggered during CD could rely on the application being fully rendered (for example, they could easily read computed styles, etc). With the change, they run before the component's updates and can get incorrect answers. The recent `afterRenderEffect()` API is a natural replacement for this style of effect.\r\n\r\n* `effect()`s which synchronize with the forms system are particularly timing-sensitive and might need to adjust their initialization timing.\r\n\r\nFixes #55311\r\nFixes #55808\r\nFixes #55644\r\nFixes #56863","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57874","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(core): change effect() execution timing & no-op `allowSignalWrites`\" (#57874)"},{"Id":"2537383684","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-19T21:17:19","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"57890","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57890","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#57890)"},{"Id":"2537374047","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-19T21:10:51","Actor":"Schneewittche7","Number":"57889","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename style-guide.md to style-guide.mdx","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It's nice to try to guarantee that it can't be null (or undefined). But in fact, you just can't guarantee that: **so please remove `viewChild.required()`** as it tricks developers into falsely thinking that the ViewChild is there and accessible while in fact it's not (and it can't be guaranteed). There's still time to do so because `viewChild.required()` is still in developer preview!\r\n\r\nAfter all, the TypeScript type should reflect the reality and not something along the lines \"it's not correct now, but will be in the future when the necessary lifecycle has finished\". \r\n\r\nSo please: consider removing `viewChild.required()`. It's much better to be honest about the type and let the developers use optional chaining. Because of the Signal based nature I suppose everybody can live with an initial `null` (or `undefined`) value and wait a little bit until the viewChild arrives. Especially because this is how `@ViewChild()` works and everybody was fine with it. It's far better to expect the `undefined` (or `null` value) than to spam NG0951 exceptions into the application.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57879","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"viewChild.required() is lying about its type - please remove this API while it's still in developer preview!\" (#57879)"},{"Id":"2536563395","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-19T14:41:29","Actor":"ChinoUkaegbu","Number":"57878","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): update wording in ComponentDecorator","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

All of the existing JS code is currently in the main `public` assets folder so is copied verbatim into the `dist` folder.   All of the code is ESM format .mjs files.\r\n\r\nMuch of the code is generic JS  and not components, etc.   I wish to gradually rewrite these into TypeScript, so that they can be imported by both the existing code and new Angular components with full type checking and intellisense.\r\n\r\nThis implies a transpiling step, and I would dearly love for this to be automated via the `watch` system so that `ng serve` notices changes and automatically reloads the code on edit.    While a `tsc && ng build` process might work, it would be very tedious to have to manually rebuild after every edit.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI had hoped that the `scripts` setting would work, but alas no.

This discrepancy between my development environment and my production application is jarring, is backwards-incompatible with existing Angular behavior from 2-17, and is even against Vite's guidance about routing when doing SSR -- see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Use vite's connect instance as middleware. If you use your own\r\n  // express router (express.Router()), you should use router.use\r\n  // When the server restarts (for example after the user modifies\r\n  // vite.config.js), `vite.middlewares` is still going to be the same\r\n  // reference (with a new internal stack of Vite and plugin-injected\r\n  // middlewares). The following is valid even after restarts.\r\n  app.use(vite.middlewares)\r\n\r\n  app.use('*', async (req, res) => {\r\n    // serve index.html - we will tackle this next\r\n  })\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe solutions proposed by @alan-agius4 are not helpful. The first isn't a solution, it is just the problem restated. The second isn't a solution, it's a \"do this other thing instead\".\r\n\r\n> Make no changes, but be aware that refreshing the page will not work when using ng serve.\r\n> Remove .html extensions from URLs. To avoid affecting SEO, you can create a server rule that redirects .html URLs to the corresponding pages without extensions using a 301 redirect. This is the recommended long-term approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commentary here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27905#issuecomment-2185785230 is widely applicable to \"non-html\" routes like `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc. Unfortunately, however, we're not talking about those, we're talking about `.html`, the **type of document that Angular is returning**.\r\n\r\n> This is expected, since the extensions matches a mime type, Including file extensions in routes is often due to legacy systems or a desire for clarity. However, this practice isn't ideal for SPAs as modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs. They enhance user experience, aid SEO, and ensure consistency across routes.\r\n\r\nThis is irrelevant fluff. \"Modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs\" is an arbitrary take on the web's current state ignoring the history of browsers as document renderers.

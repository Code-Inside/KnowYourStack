It's hard to understand (from the warning alone, and even after looking at #47988) in what way this is an issue\r\n- if the warning is necessary and something needs to be fixed for an upcoming change, maybe the warning could include a bit more information on how to do so? I suppose that most developers that are going to run into it will ask the same question. I'll gladly submit a PR to improve it if I get some guidance on what would need to be changed\r\n- if the warning is necessary, could it be displayed less often? because it is outputted dozens of times on some applications where I tested the RC\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/node-1bky4j?file=repro/src/app\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.0-rc.0\r\nNode: 16.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.0-rc.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.0-rc.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    15.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.0-rc.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49116","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"router: `The ActivatedRoute has an invalid structure` warning improvements\" (#49116)"},{"Id":"1588404072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-16T23:53:35","Actor":"atscott","Number":"49117","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(router): Remove warning for an invalid ActivatedRoute","State":"closed","Body":"This warning was put in place to surface an error when developers use an ActivatedRoute with an invalid structure in tests.

These forms are all the same, they have almost the same way functioning but there is some differences between these forms in functionally part and in template part.\r\n\r\nI need some better way of inheriting components, something like where I can define the base component with his functionality and his template, but in that template I can set some ng-template elements which I will change in child component of this parent.\r\n\r\nI found way of doing this with extending base component and in template of child component adding parent element and with nested content changing the way of parent component. Code is on SandBox (https://codesandbox.io/s/github/dsavke/inheratance-test), this is just dummy example of this situation.\r\n\r\nBaseFormComponent code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'base-form',\r\n    templateUrl: './base-form.component.html'\r\n})\r\nexport class BaseFormComponent {\r\n    private counter: number = 0;\r\n\r\n    @ContentChild('content') content!: TemplateRef<any>;\r\n\r\n    public editUrl: string = '';\r\n\r\n    public onEdit(): void {\r\n        //some logic\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public onSave(): string {\r\n        if (!this.canSave())\r\n            return 'Not saved';\r\n\r\n        return 'Saved';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public canSave(): boolean {\r\n        return true || true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private updateCounter(): void {\r\n        this.counter++;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBaseFormComponent template code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<h2>Base component</h2>\r\n<p>Can save form? {{canSave()}}</p>\r\n\r\n<ng-container\r\n    style=\"border: 1px solid red;\"\r\n    *ngIf=\"content\"\r\n    [ngTemplateOutlet]=\"content\"\r\n></ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUserFormComponent ts code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'user-form',\r\n    templateUrl: './user-form.component.html'\r\n})\r\nexport class UserFormComponent extends BaseFormComponent {\r\n    public override canSave(): boolean {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUserFormComponent template code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<base-form>\r\n\r\n    <ng-template #content>\r\n\r\n        <h5>This is from USER FORM!</h5>\r\n\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n\r\n</base-form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the only way I have found component inheritance to work in Angular, but there is several problems: \r\n\r\n1.  In this situation I am duplicating instances of BaseFormComponent, one is created when I have extended mine UserFormComponent and the other one is created in template where I put element of BaseFormComponent so I could get the UI of that component;\r\n2.  Overriding methods in UserFormComponent here is useless because instance of parent (mine extended component) is never visible (because of decorators, but I need to have two templates, one for base component who will showed and the other one for my component which I will change some structure using ng-template), it just show an instance from template;\r\n\r\nIs there some other way to do inhertance, but I need template and functionallity from parent component and I also need template and functionallity in child component, something like you get the all template from parent component, but you can change these elements in some way in child component, and this would be a real inheritance, is that even possible in Angular?\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49099","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"There is problem with Angular inheritance\" (#49099)"},{"Id":"1587133615","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-16T06:57:32","Actor":"Harpush","Number":"49098","RawContent":null,"Title":"Introduce addControls and removeControls to reactive forms","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently the only way to add or remove multiple controls or clear all controls from form group is through iterating.

This appears to be only in the 'flex' mat-table approach and not when using a native `<table>`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a mat-table without scoped CSS styles => row height is not 52px\r\n- Must use the 'flex' table approach and not native tables with directives\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSee this line from the [v15 migration docs](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-flex-basic-example.ts) under the `Table` component:\r\n\r\n    Row height is 52px instead of 48px.\r\n\r\nThat is the desired behavior for a table row per spec. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n#### Example from Angular docs (no scoped styles)\r\nIf you look at this stackblitz example from the docs [Basic use of `<mat-table>` (uses display flex)](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-basic) you will see an example which does not use [Scoped style customizations](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#scoping-style-customizations). \r\n\r\nThat particular example defines the mat styling (no wrapping selector) like this:\r\n\r\n     @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n\r\nThis mixin does indeed generate a `height:52px` selector as per spec, but it is overridden by a higher precedence selector - resulting in `height: unset`. The rows just end up at their 'natural' height. You can see that in this devtools screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"421\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219161097-fc0ed586-e074-4d29-90cf-1693c016f089.png\">\r\n\r\nThe higher precedence style appears to be coming from the [embedded scss styles in the Angular matTable component itself.](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/table/table.scss) \r\n\r\n#### Forked version with scoped styles\r\nNext I tried creating a [fork with scoped styles](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ohqraz-kxbm3v?file=src%2Ftheme.scss,src%2Findex.html) for the stackblitz page (which is how my own application is configured).\r\n\r\n    .my-styles \r\n    {\r\n       @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the scoped selector has a higher precedence resulting in a row height of 52px as per spec.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"416\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219168579-cdf1c48b-f842-4ac2-819c-6dde65b79a9a.png\">\r\n\r\nSo **without** scoped styles (as in the example stackblitz) the behavior is not to spec.\r\n\r\n#### Another mat-table example in the docs\r\nAnother example on the same page [Flex table where one column's cells has a greater height than others](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-flex-large-row) suggests using the following css to set the height of a column (the 'name' column).\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-column-name {\r\n  height: 100px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"389\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3656278/219173091-19f6ac49-9b9d-4524-af82-4eb2c68720fc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThat works in the stackblitz, but as soon as you add scoped styles it fails spectacularly because the cells are of height 100px and the containing row is of height 52px!\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nFor my own needs I actually **want** the unset behavior, with perhaps a min-height because my rows need to grow with their content. I can figure out a workaround for now.\r\n\r\nI wanted to raise this since I can't find any other issues mentioning it and the current examples are not to spec since they don't use scoped styles.\r\n\r\nNote: I've only observed this with mat-table-row heights (I only updated to v15 yesterday), but it is potentially a wider issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0 / 15.1.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Any\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Any\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Non scoped style customizations behave differently from Scoped style customizations (css precedence conflict)\" (#26628)"},{"Id":"1586073189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T15:38:49","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26627","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26627","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/core): add MatLazyOption to lazily render options\" (#26627)"},{"Id":"1585853109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-15T13:21:37","Actor":"marcramser","Number":"26626","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: Datepicker outside visible area when opened in dialog","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the mat-datepicker is opened in a component shown with the MatDialogRef on a small screen, the calendar picker is shown outside the visible area.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

checking for CdkVirtualForOf Directive","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\n### Feature Description\r\nThe CdkVirtualForOf Directive in the \"@angular/cdk/scrolling\" module does not implement the ng-template context guard, as it is done at the *ngFor Structual Directive in the Angular Common package. \r\nThus, when using the *cdkVirtualFor Structual Directive in an HTML Template, the type of the item is \"any\". \r\n\r\nExpample: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport itemSize=\"50\" class=\"example-viewport\">\r\n  <div *cdkVirtualFor=\"let item of items\" class=\"example-item\">{{ item }}</div>\r\n</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the type of the property \"items\" is \"string[]\", the type of \"item\" is \"any\".\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe type of the property \"item\" should be \"string\" when the type of \"items\" is \"string[]\".\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\nImplement the static method \"ngTemplateContextGuard\" for the CdkVirtualForOf Directive.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static ngTemplateContextGuard<T>(\r\n    directive: CdkVirtualForOf<T>,\r\n    context: unknown,\r\n  ): context is

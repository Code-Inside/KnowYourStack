The migration went well - no errors, no warnings.\r\n\r\nSo I hade to update the main.ts in my app where I previously used platformBrowserDynamic into usage of bootstrapApplication. At least I though that's the problem - anyway main.ts, AppComponent, app-routing.module has been change for standalone usage (so no modules and everything according to docs)\r\n\r\nAnyway I am still facing this issue and I don't have any clue why. Previously there was somee issues with tslib (almost identical error message but it has dissapeared after updatint the mian.ts). I tried npm cache clean -f, delete node_modules and install all deps again. Even running nx migrate multiple times - everyting is updated to latest stable. \r\n\r\nI also tried [offical doc](https://angular.io/guide/esbuild#vite-as-a-development-server) steps for changing the builder just to \"esbuild\" - but absolutely the same issue (so I don't think so, it's related to Nx).\r\n\r\n**main.ts**\r\n```\r\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from

The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to import a *.css file inside a *.ts with the following syntax:\r\n```ts\r\nimport './my-styles.css\";\r\n```\r\nThe built css file is never loaded into the application.\r\nI was pointed out in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27414 that I should use the new `loader` however that does not seem to work.\r\n\r\n`angular.json`:\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": {\r\n  \".css\": \"file\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ng serve` output:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/9380964/f30a200b-9d1b-44b3-a3d3-93f39688d10d)\r\n\r\nThis would be useful in order to support third party libraries that use this kind of imports like `monaco-editor`.\r\n\r\nVite already handles this when we run `ng serve --prebundle=true` and it works when a library uses this imports, but it does not work with `ng build` or `ng serve --prebundle=false`.\r\nAlso esbuild is able to handle the import (https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css-from-js) and generate a css bundle for all the css imports that it finds in a entry point, for example I can see it generating a `main.css` file:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/9380964/1eb57b73-9526-4792-8086-73fbfed60fa2)\r\nHowever, the css bundle outputted to the ./dist/** folder it is never loaded onto the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nng new my-app\r\ncd ./my-app\r\n\r\nCreate a *.css file called \"import-styles.css\"\r\nImport the file above into the main.ts or other *.ts file of the app.\r\n\r\nng serve\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your

User Experience\r\n1) for **shared hosts** unable to switch on new HTTP, the user experience is slow choppy\r\n2) for host <--> endpoint browsers that pass through **legacy HTTP proxies,** the user experience is slow and choppy\r\n3) for **mobile clients with intermittent connectivity,** there are multiple points of failure in downloading application code, creating cases extremely hard to debug when 234 tiny files loaded fine, but 2 silently failed\r\n\r\nB. Deployment process\r\n1) Having to deploy and account for multiple files **slows down** some forms of deployment quite significantly. In one case we use remote distributed filesystem, where change from 5 files to hundreds means standard `rsync` command turns from 3-4 minutes to 30-40 minutes\r\n2) **Partial deployment failures are hard to spot.** With 3-4 files you can see incomplete deployment vividly when you inspect the target directory; with hundreds there is no practical way to see if all files are deployed.\r\n3) **Partial deployment failures may pass sanity test** and only show in PROD after user stumbles upon edge case. In unlucky case, the chunk that's failed to deploy may not be part of core functionality, and only be noticed as missing long time after.\r\n4) **Partial deployment failures are harder to cleanup.** Deleting hundreds of files take 100x times longer than deleting a couple of them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, dealing with hundreds of build artifacts instead of handful **increases operational costs and operational risks** proportionally.\r\n\r\nIf we can get a path forward within Angular+ESBuild pipeline, even building necessary extension ourselves — that would be much appreciated.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nFriction and risks of partial failure during development lifecycle\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.0\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.1.2\r\n@angular/material               17.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nwebpack                         5.90.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nWe are using ESBuild with React in other projects within the same department, and never had **any** problems with chunks.\r\n\r\nESBuild itself can absolutely bundle code without generation of hundreds of tiny files.\r\n\r\nThe bug is not with ESBuild, but with however Angular is using ESBuild.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27418","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular with ESBuild produces massive number of tiny chunks\" (#27418)"},{"Id":"2226699423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-08T05:36:20","Actor":"Carlosamouco","Number":"27414","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support *.css file imports from *.ts using `application` builder","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we import import a css file from a typescript/javascript file, esbuild will bundle all the *.css imports for each entry point.

(ex: Whenever a docker dev environment is running on a windows host.) This is solved by adding poll option to the webpack dev server configuration. By default when no poll interval is set watchpack will use native file system change detection. This change allows for setting the poll interval which will turn on polling.

However, now I want to use the `--poll` with `ng build` for a library and this doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe only workarounds I'm left are: \r\n\r\n> For some reason nodemon and webpack-dev-server hot reload does not work in WSL2.

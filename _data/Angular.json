But no request appears in my browser's network inspector.\r\n\r\nHowever if I call this method of my service in a method of my component triggered when a button is clicked, the request works fine, but the request appears in the browser inspector\r\n\r\nThere is no error\r\n\r\non MacOs and windows\r\n\r\n\r\nservice.ts\r\n``` \r\n  get(): Observable<any> {\r\n    return this.http.get<any>(`${this.uri}`, {});\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\ncomponent.ts\r\n```\r\n    constructor(private readonly service: Service) {\r\n     service.get().subscribe((data) => { // I don't see request in inspector\r\n       console.log(data); // data is present\r\n     });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  clickGet(): void { // I see request in inspector when I click on button\r\n    this.service.get().subscribe(data) => {\r\n       console.log(data); // data is present\r\n     });\r\n  }\r\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nNode: 20.12.2\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55843","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Request with HttpClient not displayed in browser inspector but works\" (#55843)"},{"Id":"2301594886","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T00:34:22","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"55846","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(zone.js): update release guide for zone.js","State":"open","Body":"Update the releasing guide for zone.js, because one of the release commands was outdated.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55846","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(zone.js): update release guide for zone.js\" (#55846)"},{"Id":"2301081322","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T00:33:52","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"55835","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): fix type narrowing of `@if` with aliases","State":"closed","Body":"When an `@if` expression has an alias, only the type of the alias is currently narrowed. So for example, suppose `value` is `string|undefined`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (value; as alias) {\r\n  {{ value.length }} <!-- error, value may be undefined -->\r\n  {{ alias.length }} <!-- no error, alias is narrowed -->\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is especially noticeable when the expression contains guards which are preconditions for the aliased expression:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (a && b; as alias) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `a` would not be narrowed within the body, even though the `@if` condition forces it to be truthy. This is a bug.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that aliased expressions were previously type-checked as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // nothing other than alias is narrowed\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne option considered was to emit `const alias` instead of `var alias`. TypeScript _does_ trace `const` expressions and narrow their individual components when the overall expression is guarded:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst alias = a && b;\r\nif (alias) {\r\n  // a, b are also narrowed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this narrowing has different semantics than if `a && b` appeared directly in the guard expression. For example, object properties aren't narrowed with this approach, so component properties (which are referenced as e.g. `this.a`) would not be narrowed.\r\n\r\nInstead, a different technique is used: an alias variable is declared inside the `if` guard, capturing the inferred type.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (a && b) {\r\n  var alias = a && b;\r\n  // a, b, and alias all narrowed correctly.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis form ensures all conditions within the guard expression get narrowed while also narrowing the alias variable type, and works for property narrowing as well. It also allows renaming to rename the alias variable, since all references to that variable are generated with correct source mapping.\r\n\r\nFixes #52855\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler-cli): fix type narrowing of `@if` with aliases\" (#55835)"},{"Id":"2301547883","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T00:32:17","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"55845","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55845","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: cut the zone.js-0.14.6 release\" (#55845)"},{"Id":"2301545860","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T00:18:37","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"55844","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-infra: update DEVELOPER.md release instructions for zone.js","State":"closed","Body":"The previous instructions were stale.

The site has three routes, a \"home\" page listing the posts on the blog, a \"contact\" page with some simple contact details and a \"post\" page for showing a specific post.\r\n\r\nWhen loading the home page for the first time, the posts are loaded and links are shown to the relevant pages. Clicking on a post will correctly navigate to the post page and the post is shown. However, if I then navigate back to the home page, the posts are still loaded, however the links do not direct me to the post page anymore despite the url showing the correct link in the bottom left of the browser.\r\n\r\nI can also recreate the problem if I refresh on a post page, and then navigate to the home page, where again, none of the links are working.\r\n\r\nThere are no errors that I can see in the console and I have tried everything that I can think of to debug this issue but to no avail. I am wondering if this is an issue with a recent version of the framework as it doesn't seem like a particularly difficult thing to do.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

I have my project running, with no console errors / warnings, but I am struggling to get my tests to work.\r\n\r\nI am running my tests using the fakeAsync wrapper, but am getting an issue where some of the async tasks within aren't ran (Service calls, event emitters, etc.) until after any of my `expect(...)` checks fail and Angular's `resetFakeAsyncZone()` runs, despite having all the necessary `flush` / `tick` calls (`flush()` doesn't even cause `comp.ngOnInit()` to run) (this test passed before and breakpoints can show that it is still getting the same data but just not until after the expect call).\r\n\r\nIt just seems very odd that the service call will get hit after the expect fails.\r\n\r\n##### One of my failing tests\r\n```\r\nit('should call Update on submit if shouldUpdate is true', fakeAsync(() => {\r\n  // arrange\r\n  comp.shouldUpdate = true;\r\n  comp.CanAlter = true;\r\n  jest.spyOn(connectionResource, 'Update').mockImplementation((c) => {\r\n     return Promise.resolve({ ...c, Id: connection.Id, Children: [] } as ApiConnection);\r\n  });\r\n  let onSubSpy = jest.spyOn(comp.onSubmit, 'emit');\r\n\r\n  // act\r\n  comp.ngOnChanges();\r\n  flush();\r\n  fixture.detectChanges();\r\n\r\n  let result = { ...comp.form.getRawValue(), ParentId: probe.Id };\r\n  let submitButton = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('button[type=\"submit\"]'));\r\n  submitButton.nativeElement.click();\r\n  flush();\r\n\r\n  // assert\r\n  expect(connectionResource.Update).toHaveBeenCalledWith(result, connection.Id);\r\n  let cached = coreCache.SearchMonitorableTree(coreCache.PayloadCache.Monitorables[0], 'Id', connection.Id)[0];\r\n  expect(onSubSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cached); // This expect fails, and the the spied function is hit directly after\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### What I have tried so far\r\n- I have tried changing the expect to `toHaveBeenCalled()` to double check that there wasn't some small change to the model somewhere, it insisted that it wasn't called, then called it right after (same problem)\r\n\r\n- I tried using `jest.useFakeTimers()` (there were many changes to fakeTimers in the last couple Jest updates), this did not fix.\r\n\r\n- I tried adding `tick()` and `flushMicrotasks()` to see if those would have any affect, they did not.\r\n\r\n- I tried using `runInInjectionContext(fixture.debugElement.injector, () => {...});` to wrap all my inject statements to see if those were somehow injected into the Zone incorrectly.\r\n\r\n- I tried calling `resetFakeAsyncZone()` to see if that had any affect as that is what seems to cause it to work at the end, that did not work.\r\n- I tried importing `zone.js` and `zone.js/testing` in many places, but wasn't able to find any place that would fix this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nsd wan edit create form › edit connection › should call Update on submit if shouldUpdate is true\r\n    expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expected)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.4\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.4\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.4\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.4\r\nng-packagr                      17.3.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n- Here is a gif of what the bug looks like in action (Note that it starts in the expect statement, I continue and hit the breakpoint in the fakeAsync cleanup, then after cleanup happens and the fakeAsyncZone is reset, I hit the breakpoint in the service that was meant to be called before the expect statement): [![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/f5wgtsY6.gif)](https://i.sstatic.net/f5wgtsY6.gif)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55832","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 17 fakeAsync tasks not running until test is cleaned up with 'resetFakeAsyncZone()'\" (#55832)"},{"Id":"2300967180","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T17:52:40","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"55833","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): Add documentation for event replay","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'm reaching out to request a feature enhancement regarding the recent changes in the Angular framework.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the @ContentChildren decorator provided a QueryList which included a useful reset() function. This function allowed developers to modify the order of elements within the QueryList. However, with the introduction of the new Signal API contentChildren(), the returned result is now a read-only array, devoid of the reset() functionality.\r\n\r\nI understand that the Signal API offers advantages, but the absence of the reset() function has caused inconvenience in scenarios where dynamic manipulation of the query list order is required.\r\n\r\nHence, I kindly request considering the restoration of the reset() functionality for the contentChildren() Signal API in future Angular releases. This feature would greatly enhance the flexibility and usability of the framework for developers.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request. I appreciate your ongoing efforts to improve Angular and look forward to seeing its continued evolution.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nChristian\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPossibility to change order of query-result\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n---","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55823","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Subject: Feature Request: Restore Reset Functionality for contentChildren Signal API\" (#55823)"},{"Id":"2299291729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T08:05:27","Actor":"satheshsat","Number":"55822","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular localstorage not working with SSR inside Authguard","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAngular using SSR localstorage is not defined inside authguard\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nERROR ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nsample code\r\nhttps://github.com/satheshsat/angularssr","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55822","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular localstorage not working with SSR inside Authguard\" (#55822)"},{"Id":"2299018066","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T23:27:42","Actor":"garrettld","Number":"55821","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(common): fix FormatWidth.Short description","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nThe formatting for `FormatWidth.Short` is messed up:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/12160067/cb0deb48-cb23-4904-95ca-b8980eb7b13b)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThe formatting for `FormatWidth.Short` is consistent with other `FormatWidth` descriptions:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/12160067/2aac9743-732c-4d1b-9bbb-b7b941f3b656)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55821","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(common): fix FormatWidth.Short description\" (#55821)"},{"Id":"2298986914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T23:04:23","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55820","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.2 release\" (#55820)"},{"Id":"2298961542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T22:50:11","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55819","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55819","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.2\" with changelog.\" (#55819)"},{"Id":"2298863217","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T21:18:53","Actor":"leonsenft","Number":"55818","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): treat reads/exceptions in `equal` as part of computation","State":"open","Body":"Prevent leaking signal reads and exceptions from a custom `equal` function of a producer `computed()` to a consumer.\r\n\r\nUpstream https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/pull/90.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55818","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): treat reads/exceptions in `equal` as part of computation\" (#55818)"},{"Id":"2298811675","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-15T20:55:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55817","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.3.9 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.3.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55817","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.3.9 release\" (#55817)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2298840354","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T23:15:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27648","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): cleanup persistent JS transformer cache on plugin dispose","State":"closed","Body":"Close and allow the persistent JS transformer cache to cleanup open lock files when the Angular compiler plugin is disposed.

[`v0.21.3`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0213)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.21.2...v0.21.3)\n\n-   Implement the decorator metadata proposal ([#&#8203;3760](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3760))\n\n    This release implements the [decorator metadata proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorator-metadata), which is a sub-proposal of the [decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). Microsoft shipped the decorators proposal in [TypeScript 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) and the decorator metadata proposal in [TypeScript 5.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2/#decorator-metadata), so it's important that esbuild also supports both of these features. Here's a quick example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Shim the \"Symbol.metadata\" symbol\n    Symbol.metadata ??= Symbol('Symbol.metadata')\n\n    const track = (_, context) => {\n      (context.metadata.names ||= []).push(context.name)\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;track foo = 1\n      @&#8203;track bar = 2\n    }\n\n    // Prints [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n    console.log(Foo[Symbol.metadata].names)\n    ```\n\n    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**\n\n    This proposal has been marked as \"stage 3\" which means \"recommended for implementation\". However, it's still a work in progress and isn't a part of JavaScript yet, so keep in mind that any code that uses JavaScript decorator metadata may need to be updated as the feature continues to evolve. If/when that happens, I will update esbuild's implementation to match the specification. I will not be supporting old versions of the specification.\n\n-   Fix bundled decorators in derived classes ([#&#8203;3768](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3768))\n\n    In certain cases, bundling code that uses decorators in a derived class with a class body that references its own class name could previously generate code that crashes at run-time due to an incorrect variable name. This problem has been fixed. Here is an example of code that was compiled incorrectly before this fix:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo extends Object {\n      @&#8203;(x => x) foo() {\n        return Foo\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(new Foo().foo())\n    ```\n\n-   Fix `tsconfig.json` files inside symlinked directories ([#&#8203;3767](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3767))\n\n    This release fixes an issue with a scenario involving a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file from within a symlinked directory that uses the `paths` feature. In that case, the implicit `baseURL` value should be based on the real path (i.e. after expanding all symbolic links) instead of the original path. This was already done for other files that esbuild resolves but was not yet done for `tsconfig.json` because it's special-cased (the regular path resolver can't be used because the information inside `tsconfig.json` is involved in path resolution). Note that this fix no longer applies if the `--preserve-symlinks` setting is enabled.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.77.2`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1772)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.77.1...1.77.2)\n\n-   Don't emit deprecation warnings for functions and mixins beginning with `__`.\n\n-   Allow user-defined functions whose names begin with `_` and otherwise look\n    like vendor-prefixed functions with special CSS syntax.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Properly handle the `--silence-deprecation` flag.\n\n-   Handle the `--fatal-deprecation` and `--future-deprecation` flags for\n    `--interactive` mode.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Check that the production builder is using an esbuild-based script (either `application` or `browser-esbuild`)\r\n4. add an Adobe/typekit css import to your `src/styles.scss`\r\n5. `npm run build`\r\n\r\nFYI: This seems to only be an issue with builders using esbuild. The webpack-based `browser` script still works fine, but doesn't actually inline the CSS file; it just passes through the CSS `@import`, verbatim.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n![Failed to inline external stylesheet](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/545605/d5bd62fc-fea8-45d5-966e-cf873e07a393)\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ npm run build -- --verbose\r\n\r\n> ngapp17@0.0.0 build\r\n> ng build --verbose\r\n\r\n⠋ Building...\r\n\r\n  polyfills-S3BTP7ME.js  33.2kb\r\n\r\n⠏ Building...\r\n\r\n  main-LRVPNULS.js  193.2kb\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation failed.

It was previously incorrect due to lack of test coverage. Here's an example of a decorator that doesn't work without this change:\n\n    ```js\n    const dec = () => function() { this.bar = true }\n    class Foo { @&#8203;dec static foo }\n    console.log(Foo.bar) // Should be \"true\"\n    ```\n\n-   Allow `es2023` as a target environment ([#&#8203;3762](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3762))\n\n    TypeScript recently [added `es2023`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58140) as a compilation target, so esbuild now supports this too. There is no difference between a target of `es2022` and `es2023` as far as esbuild is concerned since the 2023 edition of JavaScript doesn't introduce any new syntax features.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n###

this)\n\nℹ️ Important changes added to the `.verdaccio-db.json` and token signature for users that run on Node.js 22 or higher (in the future 🙃 ) please read\nhttps://verdaccio.org/docs/configuration/#.verdaccio-db\n\nTLDR:\n\n-   Enforced for users that runs verdaccio **via npmjs**, for all Docker image isuers, verdaccio uses Node.js LTS 21 and the secret migration is **voluntary** until next major release.\n-   For **Node.js 21** or lower a new *deprecation* will appear `  [VERWAR007] VerdaccioDeprecation: the secret length is too lon... ` to remove it please read the link above\n-   For **Node.js 22** if you have already a storage with `.verdaccio-db.json` and the token inside does not complies with the length (read link above) **the application startup will fail with fatal error (`Error: Invalid storage secret key length, must be 32 characters long but is....`)**\n\nIn both cases by updating the *secret* all previously tokens will get invalid, in your benefit a new legacy signature will be applied and is more secure than the old one (generating tokens with salt).\n\nFor existing installations that have no issues by invalidating tokens is recommended to add to the `config.yaml` the following setup, this will automatically generate a new the secret once is started, could be removed aftewards, if all went succesfull the `[VERWAR007]` deprecation will not be displayed anymore.\n\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n  api:\n    migrateToSecureLegacySignature: true\n```\n\nAny new installation should not worry about this, new token signature and secret (32 characters) is applied by default.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add property forceMigrateToSecureLegacySignature

","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDate picker form control validation presents different behaviours depending on the wrong dates inputed from keyboard. Seems like the date picker only shows error for day values above 31, not taking into consideration the month.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-jh9zom?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\nReproduction is based on the values inputted from keyboard.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behaviour would be that the user would be prompted with error message everytime the keyboard value is not a valid date. Therefore the following example would trigger an error message: 2/29/2023, 4/31/2024, 5/32/2024, whereas these would be valid: 2/29/2024, 30/4/2024, 5/31/2024. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe actual behaviour is that day values above 31 will throw an error, while day values below 31 and not valid (30 days months/ february) will automatically switch the date to the next date. Therefore '4/32/2033' will trigger and error, while '4/31/2033' will swtich into '5/1/2033'. Same applies for leap years, '2/29/2023' turns into '3/1/2023'.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29057","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatDatePicker/DateRangePicker): Date picker validation seems to be missing some cases. \" (#29057)"},{"Id":"2300632035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-16T18:57:52","Actor":"poveu","Number":"29058","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): alignment issue with width 100% (TS) & default max-width (CSS)","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n16\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using MatDialog's `open` method with `{ width: 100% }` and default `max-width` (set in the styles), the dialog is not centered (because `.cdk-global-overlay-wrapper` receives `justify-content: flex-start`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/32791888/5ac3a0a2-869e-40fa-9108-377ce9be9461)\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/32791888/80042525-0418-44d7-bfc3-e02d98b433c6)\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems to be caused by `global-position-strategy` file that contains `shouldBeFlushHorizontally` check that doesn't know that the dialog has `max-width` set in the CSS.\r\n\r\nIt works fine with, for example, `maxWidth: '80vw'` set in the `open` method's config (MatDialogConfig) OR if we `open` the dialog with `{ width: '99%' }`.\r\n\r\nIt worked fine in v16.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/kmkyqc?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdialog-content-example-dialog.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Thank you very much in advance.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n I did drag&drop based on the code from this page:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dragdrop-grid?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nAnd that's what happened:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5mctqa?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations%2C%20@angular/common%2C%20@angular/compiler%2C%20@angular/core%2C%20@angular/forms%2C%20@angular/platform-browser%2C%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic%2C%20@angular/router%2C%20core-js%2C%20rxjs%2C%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fapp%2Fdashboard%2Fdashboard.component.html&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI need to implement drag and drop very similar to the first option.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe elements do not shift after the first drag, there are also a lot of errors in the ClientRect console when dragging to a cell or very often through a cell. There is no error on ClientRect if we dragged the cell, then moved it again on the spot and dropped it. And we start moving one cell at a time, the error sometimes goes away. But after 1 cell it always appears immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.3.1\r\n- CDK/Material 17.3.1:\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chorme\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):

menu, the `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` should be updated  correctly, \r\nFrom the example above, NVDA should read item2 with menu being collapsed\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs shown in the screenshot, when we click on the item2, NVDA is reading item1 with the menu being expanded\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 17.3.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.3.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n-

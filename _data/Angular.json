This is solved by adding `import 'zone.js';` at the top of `server.ts`; I'm not sure if this is expected or not.\n2. After fixing the `NG0908` error as above, `zone.js` is not being compiled to replace `async`/`await` with `Promise`s. \n\nThis is causing an issue when `withFetch()` is enabled where the Angular zone is exited during the request and never re-entered, causing errors to not be caught by the global error handler (and causing the app to crash if the request fails.)\n\nIt seems like `#2` may be caused by `#1` but the production codebase where I originally encountered this issue had `import 'zone.js'` added to the `server.ts` file way back in 2022 (possibly to resolve a similar issue, I wasn't there at the time), so I'm not sure if `#1` is unexpected or not. I'm considering `#2` to be the main issue but I can update the title if the root issue is `#1`. Thanks!\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have a fairly-minimal repro in this repository: https://github.com/w-biggs/angular-downlevel-async-withfetch-minimal-repro\n\nThe issue can be seen simply by building the app and viewing the compiled code. However, the withFetch crash errors that the issue causes can be reproduced by running the app and the static server and visiting `localhost:3000`.\n\nThe issue occurs since at least Angular v19.2.4, but the minimal repro has been updated to v20 to make sure this isn't a v19 issue.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/w-biggs/777facc0291bffdd51e85ce7d5a50ac7\n\nThis is what's printed when the app crashes, though I don't think it'll be very helpful for solving this issue (but who knows)\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.3.1\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.1\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.1 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.1\n@angular/build               20.3.1\n@angular/cli                 20.3.1\n@angular/ssr                 20.3.1\n@schematics/angular          20.3.1\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.9.2\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31213","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"async / await not being compiled for zone.js compatibility when `\"outputMode\":\"server\"`\" (#31213)"},{"Id":"3419294203","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T21:02:48","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31211","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): allow options for unit test reporters","State":"closed","Body":"This change enhances the `reporters` option in the unit-test builder to support passing an options object, similar to the existing `codeCoverageReporters` option.

The use of spread syntax and optional chaining in the source code caused build problems in older versions of Node.js (spread syntax in <8.3.0 and optional chaining in 14.0.0), so the build targets for `baseline-browser-mapping` have been changed to ES2017 to ensure compatibility.\n- This release also changes the location of `main` in `package.json` to the CommonJS export, which should only be used in older versions of node.  Any version of node using that supports ESM build should use the default location(s) in the `exports` property.\n\nA big thank you to [@&#8203;BrightTan](https://redirect.github.com/BrightTan) for

(These are from the [Pointer Lock](https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/) specification, the rest of which is not implemented.)\n- Added `customElements.getName()`. (mash-graz)\n- Updated the [virtual console](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/ab384d4e381eb6bb99ade4146698d35167b54837/README.md#virtual-consoles):\n  - `\"jsdomError\"` events are now documented, with specific `type` properties and other properties that depend on the type.\n  - `sendTo()` was renamed to `forwardTo()`.\n  - The `jsdomErrors` option to `forwardTo()` can be used to control which errors are sent to the Node.js console. This replaces the previous `omitJSDOMErrors` boolean option.\n  - `\"jsdomError\"`s for failed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches are no longer emitted.\n  - The values that are printed when forwarding `\"jsdomError\"`s to the Node.js console are streamlined.\n- Switched our CSS selector engine from [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/nwsapi) to [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector), closing over 20 selector-related bugs.\n- Upgraded [`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie), which now considers URLs like `http://localhost/` to be secure contexts (per [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy)), and thus will return `Secure`-flagged cookies for such URLs. (colincasey)\n- Upgraded [`cssstyle`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/cssstyle), which brings along many improvements and fixes to the `CSSStyleDeclaration` object and its properties.\n- Updated the user agent stylesheet to be derived from the HTML Standard, instead of from an old revision of Chromium.\n- Changed `element.click()` to fire a `PointerEvent` instead of a `MouseEvent`.\n- Changed certain events to be passive by default.\n- Changed the `<input>` element's `pattern=\"\"` attribute to use the `v` regular expression flag, instead of `u`.\n- Fixed many specification conformance issues with the `Window` object, including named properties and changing various data properties to accessor properties.\n- Fixed `document.createEvent()` to accept a more correct set of event names.\n- Fixed the `ElementInternals` accessibility getters and setters. (They were introduced in v23.1.0, but due to inadequate test coverage never actually worked.)\n- Fixed using `Object.defineProperty()` on certain objects, such as `HTMLSelectElement` instances.\n- Fixed `jsdom.reconfigure({ url })` not updating `document.baseURI` or properties derived from it. (This regressed in v26.1.0.)\n- Fixed CSS system colors, as well as the `initial`, `inherit`, and `unset` keywords, to resolve correctly. (asamuzaK)\n- Fixed CSS `display` style resolution. (asamuzaK)\n\n##### Changes since 27.0.0-beta.3\n\n- Upgraded `cssstyle`, which brings along various CSS parsing fixes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A zoneless builder option would remove friction and help teams migrate off Zone.js cleanly. 👍\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUse the builder’s providersFile hook so the internal init module applies zoneless before tests:\n\n1. angular.json\n```\n  \"test\": {\n    \"builder\": \"@angular/build:unit-test\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\n      \"runner\": \"vitest\",\n      \"buildTarget\": \"::development\",\n      \"providersFile\": \"src/test-providers.ts\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n2. src/test-providers.ts\n```\n  import { provideZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';\n  export default [provideZonelessChangeDetection()];\n```\n3. tsconfig.spec.json (ensure the file is compiled):\n```\n  \"files\": [\"src/test-setup.ts\", \"src/test-providers.ts\"]\n```\n\n...this works but is not discoverable and requires extra wiring that could be automated by the builder.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31195","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request: First-class zoneless support in @angular/build:unit-test (Vitest)\" (#31195)"},{"Id":"3409116928","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T16:12:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31190","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: use static target: automation label in renovate config","State":"closed","Body":"The `target: automation` label is used by the Angular team to identify PRs that are created by automation.

In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n### [`v10.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.0...v10.15.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `.pnp.cjs` crash when importing subpath [#&#8203;9904](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9904).\n- When resolving peer dependencies, pnpm looks whether the peer dependency is present in the root workspace project's dependencies. This change makes it so that the peer dependency is correctly resolved even from aliased npm-hosted dependencies or other types of dependencies [#&#8203;9913](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9913).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This makes the textarea very difficult to use.\n\nThe problem occurs on Google Chrome (but not in Firefox).\n\nIt appeared starting from Angular Material v19.\n\nIn v18, the behavior was correct: https://v18.material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nFrom v19 up to the current version, the bug is reproducible in Chrome: https://material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nThank you for your help and clarification.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ozyjlswf?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftext-field-autosize-textarea-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\nUsing google Chrome:\n1. start typing in the textarea (add lines pressing enter)\n2. when more that 5 lines are added, cursor deapear and we are typing in the hidden part of the textarea (we don't see what we are typing anymore)\n\nDo the same on Firefox:\n- the textarea scrolls automatically to active line\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe textarea does not scroll automatically to the active line on google chrome\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe textarea should scroll automatically to the active line on all nagigators\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20\n- CDK/Material: 20\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkTextareaAutosize): Textarea does not scroll to active line\" (#31871)"},{"Id":"3418122357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T14:04:01","Actor":"rsi21","Number":"31870","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): For some locales, the format used on display is not matching the short date format","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello, \n\nWe use the Material date picker to fill several dates and then display them with 'shortDate' pipe.\nWe also work/switch with from several locales, and we notice some inconsistencies for some of them:\n\n- de-DE\n\n<img width=\"348\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccd7f65-e399-489b-b76a-c95f998d76f5\" />\n\n- nl-NL\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69962e5-701e-495a-8564-83ab62439a29\" />\n\nIf we look at fr-FR for example, the display is correct and consistent:\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1462c799-e111-403b-8519-88ad1f84a061\" />\n\nI know CDRL is used behind the scene for locale management here, but as datePicker and shortDate are both provided by Angular, i suspect more an inconstentcy between both components.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use a sample angular 20 application, and declare provideNativeDateAdapter()\n2. Use natively the DatePicker component to select the date\n3.

columns: displayedColumns;\"></tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nThen use the parent component to project the additional content as needed for example:\n\n```\n<app-projected-table [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" [displayedColumns]=\"displayedColumns\">\n@if(staffListType === StaffType.IC) {\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"review_done\">\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Review Done </th>\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.review_done}} </td>\n  </ng-container>\n}\n@ else if(staffListType === StaffType.Leader) {\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"team_reviewed\">\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Team Reviewed </th>\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.team_reviewed}} </td>\n  </ng-container>\n\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"pip_count\">\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> PIP Count </th>\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.pip_count}} </td>\n  </ng-container>\n}\n</app-projected-table>\n```\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n1. Avoids duplication of markup and logic across components. You maintain one table shell and inject only what's unique.\n2. Promotes better collaboration and encapsulation. The table component handles layout and styling; consumers handle data logic for common patterns\n3.

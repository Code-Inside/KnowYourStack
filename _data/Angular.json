The TP compiler has changed the output of\r\n\r\n```html\r\nif (false) { <div class=\"test\"></div> }\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndefineComponent({\r\n  consts: [['class', 'test'], [AttributeMarker.Classes, 'test']],\r\n  template: function(rf) {\r\n    if (rf & 1) {\r\n      ɵɵtemplate(0, App_Conditional_0_Template, 2, 0, \"div\", 0)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndefineComponent({\r\n  consts: [[AttributeMarker.Classes, 'test']],\r\n  template: function(rf) {\r\n    if (rf & 1) {\r\n      ɵɵtemplate(0, App_Conditional_0_Template, 2, 0, \"div\", 0)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last argument to the `ɵɵtemplate` instruction (0 in both compilation outputs) corresponds with the index in `consts` of the element's attribute's, and we observe how TP has allocated only a single attribute array for the `div`, where there used to be two `consts` entries with TDB. Consequently, the `ɵɵtemplate` instruction is now effectively referencing a different attributes array, where the distinction between the `\"class\"` attribute vs. the `AttributeMarker.Classes` distinction affects the behavior: TP's emit causes the runtime to incorrectly match a directive with `selector: '.foo'` to be instantiated on the `ɵɵtemplate` instruction as if it corresponds with a structural directive!\r\n\r\nInstead of changing TP to align with TDB's emit, this commit updates the runtime instead. This uncovered an inconsistency in selector matching for class names, where there used to be two paths dealing with class matching:\r\n\r\n1. The first check was commented to be a special-case for class matching, implemented in `isCssClassMatching`.\r\n2. The second path was part of the main class matching algorithm, where `findAttrIndexInNode` was being used to find the start position in `tNode.attrs` to match the selector's value against.\r\n\r\nThe second path only considers `AttributeMarker.Classes` values if matching for content projection, OR of the `TNode` is not an inline template. The special-case in 1. however does not make that distinction, so it would consider the `AttributeMarker.Classes` binding as a selector match, incorrectly causing a directive to match on the `ɵɵtemplate` itself.\r\n\r\nThe second path was also buggy for class bindings, as the return value of `classIndexOf` was incorrectly negated: it considered a matching class attribute as non-matching and vice-versa.

Referencing fonts with caret inside path no longer possible \r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nWe have a angular libary which includes the Roboto fonts and the necessary font-face definition:\r\n// folder structure:\r\n```\r\n|── lib-name\r\n│   ├── assets\r\n│   ├──   ├── fonts\r\n│   ├──   ├──  ├── ...font-files\r\n```\r\n\r\n// fonts.scss\r\n```\r\n  @font-face {\r\n    font-family: Roboto;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    src: local('Roboto-Regular'), local('RobotoRegular'), url('**^**./assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular');\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n  \r\nWe have this caret for a reason: teams consuming the library do deploy their applications sometime into subdirectories, so this caret was needed to resolve the path correctly.\r\n\r\n// angular.json\r\n  ````\r\n{\r\n    aplication: {\r\n    architect: {\r\n       \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n

below). \r\n\r\nThis leads to the issue that angular trys to load the fonts from **http://servername/assets/fonts** with the **base href value** being \"/subfolder/smth/\". \r\nAll the necessary JS files are being loaded from the correct path: \r\nhttp://servername/subfolder/smth/main.hash.js \r\nbut the font path does not change accordingly: \r\nhttp://servername/assets/fonts\r\n\r\nThese are the options I tried when going through a lot of issues & posts:\r\n\r\n- **only tilde** in front of the path                       => url(\"~assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular\");\r\n- **tilde with slash** in front of the path              =>url(\"~/assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular\");\r\n- **dots** in front of the path                               => url(\"./assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular\");\r\n- **caret with absolute path in SCSS variable**    => url($varName + \"/Roboto-Regular\");       varName: '^./assets/fonts'\r\n- wanted to write the baseHref value into a CSS-variable and use this inside the path: https://angular.io/api/common/LocationStrategy#getBaseHref\r\n\r\nSo my questions are: \r\nHow can fonts be referenced, when the angular app is inside subdirectories?\r\nWhere can i find the  `externalDependencies` option the error message is pointing out?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\n\r\nP.S. i will try to provide a link to a repo, where this error occurs - but sadly i do have issues with my local right now which im trying to solve at the moment\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

But if the user goes to the browser chrome, like the URL bar, and then navigates with the keyboard to the page content, the focus is transferred to elements behind the dialog, making the dialog ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the dialog implementation because I display another kind of dialogs, using a custom CDK's Overlay and ConfigurableFocusTrapFactory and it can capture this kind of navigation, so this bug doesn't look like part of the focus trap implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is what I do that works fine on my custom dialog based on CDK's Overlay:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nconst focusTrap = this.focusTrapFactory.create(containerElem);\r\nfocusTrap.focusInitialElementWhenReady();\r\noverlayRef.detachments().subscribe(() => focusTrap.destroy());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Maybe start implementing the dialog component on top of the dialog element could help avoid having to use focus traps, when browser compatibility requirements allows for it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://material.angular.io/cdk/dialog/overview or https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview\r\n2. Open the first dialog example you find on the page.\r\n3. Click on the browser URL bar.\r\n4. Navigate to the page content using the Tab key.\r\n5. The focus is finally transferred to the web site top bar below the dialog's backdrop.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe focus should be transferred to the dialog elements without traversing the elements behind the dialog.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe focus is transferred the elements behind the dialog and not to the dialog elements.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox and Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Tested on Windows and Linux (Fedora)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28686","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdk-dialog): Focus trap is defeated if the user navigates to the browser chrome\" (#28686)"},{"Id":"2168323208","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-05T16:13:38","Actor":"Sonupro1997","Number":"28685","RawContent":null,"Title":"Datepicker design breaks Angular 13 ","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am using Angular Material 13.3.9 with a template-driven form that includes both a datetime picker (**@angular-material-components/datetime-picker\r\n)** and a simple material date picker.

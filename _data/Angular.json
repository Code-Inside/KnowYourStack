In the former case, we would complete creation\r\nmode for all components in the tree before beginning update mode for\r\nany component. In the latter case, we would run creation mode and\r\nupdate mode together for each component individually.\r\n\r\nMaintaining code to support these two different execution orders was\r\nunnecessarily complex, so this commit aligns the two bootstrapping\r\nmechanisms to execute in the same order. Now creation mode always\r\nruns for all components before update mode begins.\r\n\r\nThis change also simplifies our rendering logic so that we use\r\n`LView` flags as the source of truth for rendering mode instead of\r\n`rf` function arguments. This fixed some related bugs (e.g. calling\r\n`ViewRef.detectChanges` synchronously after the view's creation\r\nwould create view nodes twice, view queries would execute twice, etc).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27744","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): process creation mode deeply before running update mode\" (#27744)"},{"Id":"392400511","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T01:10:37","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"27743","RawContent":null,"Title":"FW-517 & FW-536: private directive issues","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27743","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"FW-517 & FW-536: private directive issues\" (#27743)"},{"Id":"392387775","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:07:04","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"27742","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix our copy of Array#find typing","State":"open","Body":"It should be nullable, matching the lib.es2015.d.ts from TypeScript\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27742","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: fix our copy of Array#find typing\" (#27742)"},{"Id":"392384041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T23:50:52","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"27741","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(bazel): Make sure CLI project created with Bazel works with orig…","State":"open","Body":"…inal workflow\r\n\r\nBazel bits added to a CLI project should not be destructive.\r\nThe project should still work under the original CLI workflow.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [x] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This update changes the logic to keep all overrides defined in a given test for a Type (i.e. `Type<->Override[]` map) and applies them one by one at resolution phase. This behavior is more inline with the previous TestBed.\r\n\r\nAn example test case (from `packages/platform-browser/test/testing_public_spec.ts`) that was failing is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    TestBed\r\n        .overridePipe(SomePipe, {set: {name: 'somePipe'}})\r\n        .overridePipe(SomePipe, {add: {pure: false}});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `pure` flag was changed, but the `name` remained the same, because the name-related override was replaced by the second one that sets the `pure` flag.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-852.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27734","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): apply all overrides from TestBed, not the last one only\" (#27734)"},{"Id":"392273540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T18:15:12","Actor":"benlesh","Number":"27733","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(bazel): Update VSCode config","State":"closed","Body":"What was there didn't work at all, and resulted in an error `Error processing \"attach\": Error: Both localRoot and remoteRoot must be specified`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27733","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(bazel): Update VSCode config\" (#27733)"},{"Id":"391964802","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T17:29:33","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"27719","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(bazel): devserver entry_module should have underscore name","State":"closed","Body":"This commit fixes a bug whereby the path of the entry_module is not\r\nconsistent with the workspace name, which does not permit dashes\r\nin the name.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Most users suggest to set the `Authorization` HTTP header manually. However setting this request header and passing `username`/`password` arguments to `xhr.open()` are two different things, although it will work for most environments and noone will even experience different behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever in my case there is a difference. I'm writing a Cordova app for iOS which uses WKWebView. XHRs don't work at all (!) as soon as I pass the `Authorization` header. But they work if I pass the `username` and `password` arguments to `xhr.open()`.\r\n\r\nI guess the problem arises from the pre-flight `OPTIONS` request which is sent before the actual `GET` request due to CORS. Notice that the HTTP server ignores the `Authorization` header for `OPTION` requests. It seems to be a problem of the WKWebView itself.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\n\r\nProvide new options `username` and `password` for `HttpClient.request()`s `option`-argument. Pass these values to `xhr.open` here, if set:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e98c57a404040c4e9841d5d65f99207444f16ae5/packages/common/http/src/xhr.ts#L85\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment I plan to provide a custom `XhrFactory` which returns a patched `XMLHttpRequest` object.

Let's say I have feature-module-1 and feature-module-2 - the former integrates the application with one external system and the latter with another. These two modules can't (or shouldn't) exists in my bundle together.  I want to create different bundles that contain specific integration with these two different external systems so I have a bundle with \"feature-module-1\" and another one with \"feature-module-2\" (but avoiding the burden of the router - I don't even use it). I am trying to use Angular CLI projects feature (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-multiple-apps).\r\nSample configuration:\r\nFull list of modules in a sample application:\r\nfeature-module-1\r\nfeature-module-2\r\napp.module.ts importing feature-module-1 and declaring AppComponent\r\napp2.module.ts importing feature-module-2 and declaring AppComponent\r\n\r\nNow I want to create bundles with the following components:\r\nFirst bundle:\r\nfeature-module-1\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\nSecond bundle:\r\nfeature-module-2\r\napp2.module.ts\r\n\r\nBoth bundles will use the shared AppComponent to show content on the screen.\r\n\r\nI was hoping Angular CLI \"multiple apps\" feature (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-multiple-apps) is for exactly such scenarios but even if I create new entry like explained in the above link (changing ```architect.build.options.main``` to point to different main.ts / main2.ts that import modules from app.module.ts and app2.module.ts), it still fails with \"...is part of the declarations of 2 modules...\" error.

These changes fix the issue by re-using an earlier fix that blocks interactions with the panel while it's animating.\r\n\r\nNote: an alternate approach can be to do something something similar to what we did with the ripples where we block `mouseenter` for a period after the last `touchstart` event.

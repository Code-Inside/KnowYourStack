When applying this version of the pseudo-selector to `:host` inside an Angular component with `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`, the generated CSS contains a superfluous `[_ngcontent-ng-...]` selector and does not match the expected elements.\r\n\r\n**Example:** Selecting `:host:not(.foo):not(.bar)` and `:host:not(.foo, .bar)` should be equivalent. However, the generated CSS differs like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n    [_nghost-ng-c123]:not(.foo):not(.bar) {\r\n      /* generated by :host:not(.foo):not(.bar) */\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    [_nghost-ng-c123]:not(.foo, .bar)[_ngcontent-ng-c123] {\r\n      /* generated by :host:not(.foo, .bar)  */\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the attached Stackblitz for a live demo of the issue.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fbu7bj?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.6\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.13.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.3.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.11\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.11\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.11\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.6\r\n@angular/material               14.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.11\r\nng-packagr                      14.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CSS4 :not() does not work on :host\" (#51273)"},{"Id":"1837268638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T19:56:54","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"51276","RawContent":null,"Title":"[16.2.x] refactor(core): throw an error when hydration marker is missing from DOM","State":"open","Body":"Backport of  #51170 for 16.2.x","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51276","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[16.2.x] refactor(core): throw an error when hydration marker is missing from DOM\" (#51276)"},{"Id":"1837229824","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T19:19:08","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"51275","RawContent":null,"Title":"Package Style with Directives","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore, elements\n\n### Description\n\nIt would be nice to have the ability to package style with `@Directives` as well as with `@Components`.\r\n\r\nWe can create directives that alter the structure of components and sometimes we use CSS as part of the alteration ...\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd something to `@Directives` that allows the style to be packaged with the directive ...\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently I just put styles associated with directives in the structure mixin for the theme...like this....\r\n\r\n```\r\n@mixin structure($theme) {\r\n    .el-RoundedSelect\r\n        .mat-mdc-form-field-flex\r\n        .mdc-notched-outline\r\n        .mdc-notched-outline__notch\r\n        label.mdc-floating-label--float-above {\r\n        top: 28px !important;\r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see it does not really depend on the theme, but it just ended up being a logical place to put it since directives can't include the style directly ...\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Package Style with Directives\" (#51275)"},{"Id":"1837159267","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T18:15:09","Actor":"delbertooo","Number":"51274","RawContent":null,"Title":"Long numeric HTML Entities in templates are compiled wrong","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIn HTML you can use numeric HTML Entities (hex or decimal) to represent characters (e.g. emojis and other symbols).

From my observations my blind guess would be, that Angular tries to simply translate these into old-style JS Unicode escapes. These old style escapes support 4 hexadecimal chars only (`\"\\u0000\"` to `\"\\uFFFF\"`). So these longer Strings get simply chopped of after the 4 right-most hexadecimal chars.\r\n\r\nI guess Angular would compile HTML `&#x1FFFF;` into JS `\"\\uFFFF\"` (missing `1`).\r\n\r\n## Why do I think so?\r\n\r\nIt just looks like it in the compiled templates of my example. See the comments in the compiled templates below.\r\n\r\nProduction build:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst compiled = {\r\n    // ...\r\n    template: function (n, r) {\r\n        if (1 & n && (gt(0,

Effectively, we need to serialize 2 pieces of info: (1) hydration info for the root component itself and (2) hydration info for the ViewContainerRef instance (an LContainer). Each piece of information is included into the hydration data (in the TransferState object) separately, thus we end up with 2 ids. Since we only have 1 root element, we encode both bits of info into a single string: ids are separated by the `|` char (e.g. `10|25`, where `10` is the `ngh` for a component view and 25 is the `ngh` for a root view which holds LContainer).\r\n\r\nPreviously, we were only including component-related information, thus all the views in the view container remained dehydrated and duplicated (client-rendered from scratch) on the client.\r\n\r\nResolves #51157.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51247","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): handle hydration of view containers for root components\" (#51247)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1837317597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-04T20:44:15","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25640","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): move TypeScript diagnostic conversion into compilation base","State":"open","Body":"When using the esbuild-based browser application builder, TypeScript diagnostics are now converted into esbuild messages within the compilation base class instead of the plugin.

When I type in a date that is after the max date, and then open the calendar, a marker appears on both the date I typed in and the max date. This behaviour could arguably be slightly confusing to the user but it is particularly misleading in the instance that the highlighted max date is actually disabled due to custom validation. The same issue can be seen for the minimum date.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/71448881/a2f4c43d-61f4-4ee1-be13-9cd381d7e33f)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=package.json (an example from the docs)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In datepicker-min-max-example.ts, adjust the max date so that it is not the last day of the month (so that the issue can be seen) e.g. change it to the 15th\r\n2. In the input, type in a date which is after the max date - e.g. the 18th\r\n3. Open the calendar and you will see that two dates are highlighted - the date that was typed in and the maximum date.\r\n4. Provide a custom validator that would render the maximum date disabled e.g. if the max date was a Sunday but weekends are not allowed. Repeat steps 2 & 3 and you will see that this date is highlighted even though it is invalid.\r\n5. Same steps for minimum date.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI am expecting to see only one date highlighted on the calendar - just the (invalid one) that was typed in. If this is not desired, then it should still take into account other invalid/disabled dates through customer validator, so it should highlight the maximum valid date rather than the general maximum date regardless of its validity. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI saw two dates highlighted on the calendar - the date I typed in and the maximum date. The maximum date is also highlighted even when it has been rendered invalid by a custom validator, which could be misleading to users - this is the main issue. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.1.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.1.6\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27573","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): Duplicate marker on calendar pop up when inputting date that is outwith min/max dates\" (#27573)"},{"Id":"1834420332","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-03T11:40:33","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27572","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): don't assign to model value while typing when requireSelection is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"Follow-up to #27423 based on the feedback.

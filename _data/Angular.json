This approach got us pretty far, but as developers have built more complex reactive systems, we've hit the limitations of this design.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the nature of effects significantly. In particular, effects created in components have a completely new scheduling system, which executes them as a part of the change detection cycle. This results in behavior similar to that of nested effects in other reactive frameworks. The scheduling behavior here uses the \"mark for traversal\" flag (`HasChildViewsToRefresh`). This has really nice behavior:\r\n\r\n * if the component is dirty already, effects run following preorder hooks (ngOnInit, etc).\r\n * if the component isn't dirty, it doesn't get change detected only because of the dirty effect.\r\n\r\nThis is not a breaking change, since `effect()` is in developer preview (and it remains so).\r\n\r\nFixes #55311\r\nFixes #55808\r\nFixes #55644\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56501","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): rework effect scheduling\" (#56501)"},{"Id":"2360794727","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-18T21:49:37","Actor":"ssdeepak","Number":"56500","RawContent":null,"Title":"Snapdragon X Elite Arm / Windows , No native build was found for platform=win32 arch=arm64","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler, core, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n I tried Angular 18 on my  new Snapdragon X Elite\r\n\r\nWhen I try to run the project from VSCode I get this error. \r\nNo native build was found for platform=win32 arch=arm64 runtime=node abi=127 uv=1 armv=8 libc=glibc node=22.3.0\r\n    attempted loading from: D:\\Junk\\my-app\\node_modules\\lmdb and package: @lmdb/lmdb-win32-arm64\r\n \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nng serve --o\r\nApplication bundle generation failed.

This arose in https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/issues/274 and https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-6210.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem is the Angular compiler generating a SSR bundle, because this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst AsyncIteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(async function* () {}).prototype);\r\n```\r\n\r\nturns into \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    var AsyncIteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(function() {\r\n      return __asyncGenerator(this, null, function* () {\r\n      });\r\n    }).prototype);\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly when I run `npm run build` using the ng compiler (see the example repro).

Please see the minimal example using ifdef-loader (https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/grapehunter/ngtool_webpack_show):\r\n\r\n**webpack.config.json**\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = (env) => {\r\n    ...\r\n    module: {\r\n      rules: [\r\n        {\r\n          test: /\\.[cm]?[tj]sx?$/,\r\n          resolve: { fullySpecified: false },\r\n          exclude:\r\n            /[\\\\/]node_modules[/\\\\](?:core-js|@babel|tslib|web-animations-js|web-streams-polyfill|whatwg-url)[/\\\\]/,\r\n          use: [\r\n            { loader: \"ifdef-loader\", options: { DEBUG: !isProduction } }, \r\n            { loader: path.resolve(__dirname, \"./scripts/trace-loader.cjs\") }, // log source code in pipeline\r\n            {\r\n              loader: \"@ngtools/webpack\",\r\n            },\r\n          ],\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**index.ts**\r\n```ts\r\n...\r\n/// #if DEBUG\r\nalert(\"Running in development mode!\");\r\n/// #else\r\nalert(\"Running in production mode!\");\r\n/// #endif\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-root\",\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  /// #if DEBUG\r\n  template: ` <h1>Hello from development!</h1> `,\r\n  /// #else\r\n  // @ts-ignore\r\n  template: ` <h1>Hello from production!</h1> `,\r\n  /// #endif\r\n})\r\nexport class App {}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n  providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()],\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. If the example code is executed first by @ngtools/webpack (AngularWebpackPlugin), then the code processed by @ngtools/webpack is printed out as follows through trace-loader.cjs:\r\n```ts\r\n/// #if DEBUG\r\nalert(\"Running in development mode!\");\r\n/// #else\r\nalert(\"Running in production mode!\");\r\n/// #endif\r\nexport class App {\r\n}\r\nApp.ɵfac = function App_Factory(t) { return new (t || App)(); };\r\nApp.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/ i0.ɵɵdefineComponent({ type: App, selectors: [[\"app-root\"]], standalone: true, features: [i0.ɵɵStandaloneFeature], decls: 2, vars: 0, template: function App_Template(rf, ctx) { if (rf & 1) {\r\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"h1\");\r\n        i0.ɵɵtext(1, \"Hello from production!\");\r\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\r\n    } }, encapsulation: 2 });\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n    providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()],\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, after @ngtools/webpack compilation, the commented code within the @Component scope disappears. Thus, when ifdef-loader receives the code, it cannot process the second /// #if DEBUG in main.ts, leading to incorrect page output (`Hello from production!` instead of the correct `Hello from development!`).\r\n\r\n2. If { loader: \"ifdef-loader\", options: { DEBUG: !isProduction } } is placed below @ngtools/webpack, i.e., ifdef-loader is executed first and then @ngtools/webpack. Since @ngtools/webpack internally loads source files from the path, not through the loader pipeline, the final compiled result will ignore any changes made by ifdef-loader to the code.\r\nHere is an example of an incorrectly executed project: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/grapehunter/ngtool_webpack_show\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n## The modification method I am currently using\r\nI currently preprocess the code by patching the AngularWebpackPlugin configuration parameters of @ngtools/webpack to add a sourceModifier. \r\nThe patch file is as follows:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js b/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\nindex 9c970d0..8c00f1f 100644\r\n--- a/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\n+++ b/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\n@@ -139,7 +139,7 @@ class AngularWebpackPlugin {\r\n         // Webpack lacks an InputFileSytem type definition with sync functions\r\n-        compiler.inputFileSystem, (0, paths_1.normalizePath)(compiler.context));\r\n+        compiler.inputFileSystem, (0, paths_1.normalizePath)(compiler.context), this.pluginOptions.sourceModifier ??

By utilizing `Promise.all`, we achieve improved performance and readability when dealing with asynchronous operations.\r\n\r\n**Benefits of Promise.all:**\r\n\r\n* **Improved Performance:** `Promise.all` allows all the asynchronous functions to execute concurrently, potentially leading to significant performance gains, especially when dealing with independent tasks.\r\n* **Simplified Code:** By using `Promise.all`, we can group multiple asynchronous operations into a single line, making the code more concise and easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27862","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Utilize Promise.all for Efficient Asynchronous Operations 🚀\" (#27862)"},{"Id":"2354992788","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-15T17:27:09","Actor":"born2net","Number":"27860","RawContent":null,"Title":"constructor.name now gives _aXX instead of component name","State":"closed","Body":"using ESBuild we don't have the ability to get component name like we used to with WebPack.\r\nconstructor.name no longer worls.\r\nIs there a different solutionm?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27860","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"constructor.name now gives _aXX instead of component name\" (#27860)"},{"Id":"2356883621","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-15T09:43:13","Actor":"kfrederix","Number":"27866","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Ripple): error \"Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'FADING_IN')\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3\n\n### Description\n\nAn error is thrown for production builds when following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. The angular appplication makes uses of material (for example MatDialog) but does not make use of MatButton (or MatRipple directly)\r\n2. The webpack builder is used (`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser`)\r\n3. It happens only when building in production mode (not in development mode)\r\n\r\nThe following error is thrown in JS console, and the app is broken:\r\n``` bash\r\nTypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'FADING_IN')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: since I could not reproduce this with the esbuild builder (`@angular-devkit/build-angular:application`), this could very well be an issue related to the angular-cli instead of material itself. Since I am not 100% sure, I am reporting it here.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sjwtcm-g8jwcl?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdialog-data-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

(as expected)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen Form Control that is bound to a datepicker is updated via a call to `fooFormControl.setValue(bar)`, DateChange and DateInput Component level Outputs should emit because the date of the datepicker changed.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo events are emitted from the DateChange and DateInput component level outputs.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16 & 17\r\n- CDK/Material: 16\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29255","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(Datepicker): DatePicker does not emit event for `DateChange` or `DateInput` when bound form control setValue is called.\" (#29255)"},{"Id":"2355656804","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-17T06:33:16","Actor":"davidlj95","Number":"29270","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/card): remove unneeded null coalescing from example","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #29167\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(material/card): remove unneeded null coalescing from example\" (#29270)"},{"Id":"2354285149","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-15T00:16:29","Actor":"ysk3a","Number":"29266","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Sidenav): deprecated methods used in the responsive sidenav example","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/components-examples/material/sidenav/sidenav-responsive/sidenav-responsive-example.ts\r\n\r\nIn the stackblitz demo, it shows that addlistener and removelistener are deprecated.\r\nI just wanted to create this documentation issue to let the contributors/maintainers aware.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/examples#sidenav-responsive","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(Sidenav): deprecated methods used in the responsive sidenav example\" (#29266)"},{"Id":"2354234309","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-14T23:30:52","Actor":"Andrew-Marks-Trisept","Number":"29265","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(DatePicker): Keyboard focus lost after selecting first date in range (accessibility failure)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen custom `dateFilter` functions are used to control which dates can be selected for the start and end dates on a `mat-date-range-input`, the keyboard focus is lost/reset after the user selects a start date.  They must tab several times to get back to the right place so they can select their end date.\r\n\r\nNote I'm dynamically switching between two different `dateFilter` functions, depending on which date is being selected.\r\n\r\nThis issue is causing us to fail our accessibility audit.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/4yvmaz?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdate-range-picker-overview-example.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In the Custom Date Filters Example, tab to the calendar icon and open it with Enter\r\n2. Use arrow keys to navigate the calendar and hit Enter to select a start date\r\n3. Notice the arrow keys now do nothing and you are unable to select an end date with the keyboard unless you tab several times and find the right place again.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Custom Date Filters Example provided should work exactly like the Basic Example.  After selecting a start date, you should be able to use the arrows and Enter key again to select an end date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFocus seems to be lost or reset after the first date is selected.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be related to the fact that the date that currently has focus (the selected start date) gets disabled in my example due to my end date requirements.  But even if I allow the start date as a valid end date, the problem persists.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Seems to be all versions, tested here with 18.0.3\r\n- CDK/Material: Seems to be all versions, tested here with 18.0.3\r\n- Browser(s): Confirmed in Chrome, Edge and Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DatePicker): Keyboard focus lost after selecting first date in range (accessibility failure)\" (#29265)"},{"Id":"2354204397","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-14T22:52:44","Actor":"essjay05","Number":"29264","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog): dialog name on mac only using aria-label","State":"open","Body":"Fixes bug with Angular Components Dialog component on Mac whether using Chrome or Firefox the screenreader does not read the dialog name/title unless it is using an aria-label.

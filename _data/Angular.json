children lazy routes does not receive segments nor route properties","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nrouter\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using canMatchFn in a nested route that is lazy loaded and whose path is '' (empty), I don't get the parent route segments.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst parentRoutes = [\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':id',\r\n        loadChildren: () => import('./pages/child/child-routes').then(m => m.childRoutes)\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst childRoutes = [\r\n    {\r\n        path: '',\r\n        component: ChildComponent,\r\n        canMatch: [myCustomGuard]\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst myCustomGuard = (route, segments) => {\r\n    console.log('Guard parameters', \r\n        {\r\n            route, // This does not contain any information at all about the route nor path\r\n            segments // This is an empty array [], but the :id parameter value would be expected\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I move the ':id' parameter to the child routes definitions, then I get the segment as expected.\r\n\r\n## why this is a problem\r\nThis makes it impossible to do routing in parent route files that then get matched with more detailed ones in specific module features lazy loaded when required.\r\n\r\nFor example, I do have a parent routing file that matches:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst parentRoutes = [\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':id/something'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':id/anotherSomething'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        path: ':id'\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I were to move the path parameters to the children routes, then all my lazy loaded modules would get fetched in order of checking their routes for matches, but I already know that I don't need most of those modules because I am matching :id and not :id/something\r\n\r\nI could not find any mean of retriving the route that is beign tested for match, and using location.url or path is not an option, as this canMatch is done before actually redirecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\nExample is running in Angular 17, which is also presenting this

offline service workers (504) after migrating to @angular-devkit/build-angular:application from :browser","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv17\n\n### Description\n\nBackground: Mostly vanilla angular application using PWA since Angular ~5 doing normal `ng update`s.\r\n\r\nService worker only being used for caching static assets and serving them offline\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to v18 I accepted the migration to `:application` - the schematic did not migrate the `build.configurations.production.serviceWorker` from a boolean (`true`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng serve --proxy-config proxy-dev.conf.json  --configuration production\r\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must be string.\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \"/serviceWorker\" must match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrough trial and error I discovered the \"correct\"  new value for the `build.configurations.production.serviceWorker` field: `ngsw-config.json` (aside -- FR: link the schema from [the migration docs](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration)? 🙏)\r\n\r\nThe service worker appeared to fetch and serve assets as expected **but** just before promoting from canary to prod I did an extra QA pass (it was sus that my `angular.json` wasn't properly migrated) and discovered that refreshing while offline now reported a 504\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20240818_113433](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ba9b97-6140-49e7-a469-215318d4aa48)\r\n\r\nThe above 504 is being served from the Service Worker and it appears the handling logic isn't serving the cached copy on network error anymore.\r\n\r\n* ⛔ Running my v18 build locally with `ng serve --configuration production` shared the same issue\r\n* ✅ Reverting to v17 and it again worked as expected.\r\n* ✅ Making a new v18 build with `angular.json` reverted to the v17 version (using `:build` rather than `:application`) works as expected when using `ng serve --configuration production`\r\n* ⛔ Making a new v18 build with the reverted `angular.json` and substituting `:build` for `:build-esbuild` failed to register any service worker \r\n  * This seems like a separate issue, the `:application` build does still register the SW and serve assets\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI assume (but have not tested) this would affect any PWA-enabled repo upgraded from v17 to v18 which performs the migration.\r\n\r\nI have a workaround that allows me to upgrade to v18 (using the old & busted webpack builder)\r\n\r\nBelow are the relevant files and commands I

server","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nAngular 16\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nServing a PWA with the default dev server is now broken.\r\nSpecifically, the vite dev server apparently mangles the files emitted by the previous build steps, but does not recompute the hashes stored in `ngsw.json`.\r\nThis results in the service worker being installed, but not really serving any file.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to use the \"old\" (webpack-based) dev server that is apparently not affected by this.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nBasically the steps are:\r\n - create a new app `ng new`\r\n - make it a PWA `ng add @angular/pwa`\r\n - configure it to start the service worker in dev\r\n - start it `ng serve`\r\n - open it in the browser http://localhost:4200/ and wait a few seconds (so that the service worker can initialize)\r\n - check the sw state at http://localhost:4200/ngsw/state\r\n\r\nA full repo reproducing the issue is https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro\r\nFrom this repo, the needed steps are:\r\n - choose the commit to start from (https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro/commit/a524b1a36049d77690ac6f37c14a56d1d501a042 to check the issue with vite, https://github.com/ranma42/pwa-repro/commit/6207a68be012eb680e000ff02f82b65c1d6b4b8d to compare with webpack)\r\n - install the dependencies `npm install`\r\n - start the server `ng serve`\r\n - open the app in the browser http://localhost:4200/ and wait a few seconds (so that the service worker can initialize)\r\n - check the sw state at http://localhost:4200/ngsw/state\r\n\r\nNote that the repo contains both a revision that reproduces the issue and one that configures the build to use webpack for comparison, to show that in that case the dev server works as intended.\r\nAlso note that to properly check what is going on, you might want to clear the browser state by opening the inspector and (in Chrome-based browsers) going to Application -> Storage -> Clear site data\r\n\r\nWith the

An explanation of the background can be found here: https://rollupjs.org/faqs/#why-do-additional-imports-turn-up-in-my-entry-chunks-when-code-splitting\r\n\r\nApparently, it should be possible to prevent this hoisting by configuring the `hoistTransitiveImports` option for rollup: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-hoisttransitiveimports\r\n\r\nYet, it appears that Angular won't let me add any custom configuration options for rollup. So, I wonder if hoisting of transitive imports shouldn't be disabled by default when building libraries in order to avoid these unnecessary warnings.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I fail to produce a minimal example of a library that would be split into chunks and have its imports hoisted.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the

[`v0.23.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0231)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.23.0...v0.23.1)\n\n-   Allow using the `node:` import prefix with `es*` targets ([#&#8203;3821](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3821))\n\n    The [`node:` prefix on imports](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#node-imports) is an alternate way to import built-in node modules. For example, `import fs from \"fs\"` can also be written `import fs from \"node:fs\"`. This only works with certain newer versions of node, so esbuild removes it when you target older versions of node such as with `--target=node14` so that your code still works. With the way esbuild's platform-specific feature compatibility table works, this was added by saying that only newer versions of node support this feature. However, that means that a target such as `--target=node18,es2022` removes the `node:` prefix because none of the `es*` targets are known to support this feature. This release adds the support for the `node:` flag to esbuild's internal compatibility table for `es*` to allow you to use compound targets like this:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import fs from 'node:fs'\n    fs.open\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --format=esm --platform=node --target=node18,es2022)\n    import fs from \"fs\";\n    fs.open;\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --format=esm --platform=node --target=node18,es2022)\n    import fs from \"node:fs\";\n    fs.open;\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a panic when using the CLI with invalid build flags if `--analyze` is present ([#&#8203;3834](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3834))\n\n    Previously esbuild's CLI could crash if it was invoked with flags that aren't valid for a \"build\" API call and the `--analyze` flag is present. This was caused by esbuild's internals attempting to add a Go plugin (which is how `--analyze` is implemented) to a null build object. The panic has been fixed in this release.\n\n-   Fix incorrect location of certain error messages ([#&#8203;3845](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3845))\n\n    This release fixes a regression that caused certain errors relating to variable declarations to be reported at an incorrect location. The regression was introduced in version 0.18.7 of esbuild.\n\n-   Print comments before case clauses in switch statements ([#&#8203;3838](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3838))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will attempt to print comments that come before case clauses in switch statements. This is similar to what esbuild already does for comments inside of certain types of expressions.

Basically, we are trying to contain styles in the library itself and do not want to explicitly import any styles into the application that consumes the library. \r\n\r\nWe are currently utilizing the Syncfusion Angular Scheduler component in an exportable Angular library. You can find more details [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/schedule/getting-started).\r\n\r\nConventionally, we provide styles for our ej2-angular-scheduler control by importing them from the node_modules directory as follows:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-buttons/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-calendars/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-dropdowns/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-inputs/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-lists/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-popups/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-navigations/styles/material.css';\r\n@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule/styles/material.css';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have encountered an issue where, during the ng build process, the styles are bundled correctly in a standard Angular application and the component renders as expected. However, when building the same component within an Angular library and when we packed and export it, the styles are not bundled properly, leading to issues with the component rendering in the consuming application it take more time for compilation as well as styles not applied. \r\n\r\nCould you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue or suggest best practices for managing styles in Angular libraries to ensure they are properly bundled and applied?\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have attached a sample demonstration where an exportable Angular library (mylib) contains the Scheduler component.

While the affected documentation page shows that it is a component that is compatible with m3 styles, implementing this into a class:\r\n`@include mat.chips-color($theme, $color-variant: $color);`\r\napplying the class to a mat-chip does not affect the color variant.\r\n\r\nI have labeled this as a docs bug because m3 styling options are not referenced at all in the mat-chips documentation here: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview and there are no examples of styling chips in the docs. If styling chips is an intended feature, this issue should be moved into m3 bug as the scss is not producing correct styling when including the mat.chips-color mixin.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAfter a couple of hours of testing, I have identified that color variance only affects 'mat-chip-option' components when they are selected. This should be included in component overview documentation and potentially have an example with various styling as to show that color variance will not affect the standard mat-chip.\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-component-color-variants","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29576","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Chips\" (#29576)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-08-19T03:30:02.0060609Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1316}

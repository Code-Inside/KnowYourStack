signal","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the `LView` in Angular to be a `Consumer` of signals. If a signal is read when executing a template, it marks the view dirty. In addition, if a signal is read when executing host bindings, it also marks views dirty.\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing about signal reads in host bindings is that they perform a bit better than what we can do with today's APIs. In order to re-execute host bindings for an `OnPush` component that might have changed, you would probably inject `ChangeDetectorRef` and call `markForCheck`. This will mark the _current component_ and parents dirty. However, host bindings are executed as part of refreshing the _parent_ so there is really no need to re-execute the current component if the only thing that changed is the host bindings. When a signal is read in host bindings, it marks the parent dirty and not the component that defined the host binding.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit avoids allocating a full consumer for each `LView` by re-using a consumer until template execution results in a signal read. At this point, we assign that consumer to the `LView` and create a new consumer to \"tentatively\" use for the future `LView` template executions.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Dylan Hunn <github@dylanhunn.com>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49153","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): Mark components for check if they read a signal\" (#49153)"},{"Id":"1593280125","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-21T21:36:47","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"49148","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/cache digest to 69d9d44","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/cache](https://togithub.com/actions/cache) | action | digest | `6998d13` -> `69d9d44` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

So in 2017, Angular decided to go for a custom implementation, which I think was the right decision at the time. But today we are in a quite different situation. Internet Explorer support has been dropped from Angular, browser support has evolved and the browsers heavily worked on unification of their APIs. In my opinion, it should be re-evaluated whether to switch back to the Intl APIs.\r\n\r\nThis would have an effect to all pipes which require locale data, namely `date`, `currency`, `decimal` and `percent`. For developers who don't use compile-time translations it's quite inconvenient to feed those pipes with locale data. Developers need to import from `@angular/common/locales/{localeId}`, and register the data with `registerLocaleData()`. When supporting multiple locales, either they all need to be added to the bundle, or alternatively they can be loaded with a dynamic import. As a result, additional chunks containing the locale data for each language are generated. Those chunks need to be loaded at runtime depending on the locale of the user. This can lead to missing locale data while loading the application due to timing issues. The handling of locale data is the main reason why I personally don’t use any of these Angular pipes anymore and wrote own pipes instead based on `Intl`. I assume I’m not the only one.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, after a quick search in the GitHub issues, I found that there are some issues with the implementation of the pipes, which could be resolved: #47479 #48279 #48250 #45409 and more\r\n\r\nTo list some of the benefits:\r\n* Implementation is much simpler\r\n* Locale data of any locale supported out of the box\r\n    * Angular wouldn't need to care about locales at all -> less maintenance effort\r\n    * Developers wouldn't need any additional code to register locale data\r\n    * The application wouldn't need to load any code related to to locale data\r\n    * In general, less pitfalls for the developers\r\n* Falls back to browser default locale if no locale is specified\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAngular refactors existing pipes to use the `Intl.*` browser APIs. As this might lead to breaking changes, maybe it would make sense to offer them as an opt-in.\r\n\r\nAngular could also consider adding new pipes based on the Intl APIs such as `country`, `language`, `relativeTime`, ..., as they should be relatively easy to implement and maintain.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCould also be solved by a community npm package. I'm currently developing one, feedback is very welcome!\r\nhttps://github.com/json-derulo/angular-ecmascript-intl","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49143","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider switching back to `Intl` browser APIs for internationalization\" (#49143)"},{"Id":"1591957878","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-20T15:17:01","Actor":"devversion","Number":"49142","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix rbe initialization failing in windows job and attempt to fix flakiness","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fix rbe initialization failing in windows job and attempt to fix flakiness\" (#49142)"},{"Id":"1591774855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-20T12:30:51","Actor":"johnmanners","Number":"49141","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in toh-pt6.md","State":"open","Body":"Line 425.

Under the hood, this mostly rerenders the Angular application from scratch, which is better than a full page reload, but could definitely be improved. @alan-agius4 has suggested a number of opportunities for improving HMR. Most importantly, our strategy here should be to optimize the turnaround time for any given change _scaled_ with the frequency of that kind of change. For example, it is very common to make numerous tiny adjustments to CSS in quick succession while finding the precise styling needed for a page. This is a very hot path to optimize and even marginal improvements here can have a bit impact due to how frequently CSS-only changes are made during development.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSome ideas to improve HMR include (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n* Fast track CSS-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * This should be relatively straightforward since we mostly need to correlate a component class with its `<style />` tag on the page, then delete and recreate that tag with the new CSS content. This would be very fast and maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline styles is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Fast track Angular template-only changes and apply them to any existing components on the page.\r\n    * In theory, we just need to delete the generated JavaScript render functions for a component and overwrite them with the new render functions from the modified template, then re-apply the DOM.\r\n    * In practice, I think this is a challenge as Angular templates aren't completely stateless (ex. `async` pipe). But this is likely achievable in some capacity. Should be pretty quick and mostly maintain page state.\r\n    * Supporting inline templates is a bit more complicated but should be achievable?\r\n* Re-render only the currently displayed Angular route, rather than the full application.\r\n    * Statistically speaking, most code changes will be within the currently displayed Angular route and won't impact anything outside the route. In many cases, it would be sufficient to just rerender that one route.\r\n\r\nAngular template and CSS changes in particular are two areas where users frequently make a large number of small changes in quick succession and in a manner which is easy for tooling to reason about. These are two spaces where we can have a huge impact on developer's quality of life.\r\n\r\nIf we can get this good enough, I'd love to get to a place where we could turn `--hmr` on by default in `ng serve`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nHMR is mostly one facet of the larger problem around \"How do we make the time between editing a file and reloading its changes in the browser as quick as possible?\" (edit/refresh time). HMR is one means of getting built changes into the running browser faster and maintain the application's current state. We should (and are) investigating ways to improve the overall edit/refresh experience independent of HMR.\r\n\r\nMore related to HMR, the focus on Angular template and CSS changes does highlight a lack of focus on TypeScript changes. This is somewhat intentional. Angular has strong separation of concerns between Angular templates (for HTML/DOM rendering), CSS (for styling), and TypeScript (for component functionality). While this isn't absolute and TypeScript can often containing rendering or styling functionality (ex. list filters or conditional CSS classes), the vast majority of DOM and CSS changes made by a developer will be done by editing a template or a stylesheet, not TypeScript.\r\n\r\nTypeScript changes are also very tricky to apply consistently with HMR. As one example, renaming a class field in TypeScript _can_ be HMR'd, however doing so often leads to inconsistencies and confusing behavior. HMR is intended to maintain the current user state, but it is effectively impossible for the build process to understand that deleting a `foo` field and creating a `bar` field as intended as a rename and state should be transferred from one property to the other during HMR. At runtime, it looks like this renamed field just \"forgot\" all its state, which can easily break the component and cause errors which require a full page reload to fix. That's one example, but the sheer variety of possible changes a user can make to TypeScript code means it can never be totally consistent or reliable.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely be open to improvements here where we can take advantage of them, and we should make sure not to let \"perfect\" be the enemy of \"good enough\". The key takeaway here is that HMR of TypeScript-only changes in Angular is simultaneously the hardest to do right, and also the least impactful. Again, _scaling_ the impact of optimizing a particular change with the _frequency_ that kind of change occurs is where we can find the most value for users.\r\n\r\n/cc @alan-agius4 for other ideas around improving HMR, definitely lots of cool stuff we're hoping to do here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Hot Module Replacement (HMR)\" (#24755)"},{"Id":"1593448992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-21T16:56:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24753","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/core): remove deprecated exceptions","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nWith commits removes the several deprecated exceptions.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\n- `ContentHasMutatedException`, `InvalidUpdateRecordException`, `UnimplementedException` and `MergeConflictException` API from `@angular-devkit/core` have been removed in favor of the API from `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\r\n- `UnsupportedPlatformException` - A custom error exception should be created instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24753","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/core): remove deprecated exceptions\" (#24753)"},{"Id":"1593466417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-21T13:14:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"24754","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove deprecated `outputPaths` and `outputPath` Builder output","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nRemove the deprecated `outputPath` and `outputPaths` from the server and browser builder.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nDeprecated `outputPath` and `outputPaths` from the server and browser builder have been removed from the builder output.

The `@nest` prefix that was previously required in some cases is now gone, and nested rules no longer have to start with `&` (as long as they don't start with an identifier or function token).\n\n    This release updates esbuild's pass-through handling of CSS nesting syntax to match the latest specification changes. So you can now use esbuild to bundle CSS containing nested rules and try them out in a browser that supports CSS nesting (which includes nightly builds of both Chrome and Safari).\n\n    However, I'm not implementing lowering of nested CSS to non-nested CSS for older browsers yet. While the syntax has been decided, the semantics are still in flux. In particular, there is still some debate about changing the fundamental way that CSS nesting works. For example, you might think that the following CSS is equivalent to a `.outer .inner button { ... }` rule:\n\n    ```css\n    .inner button {\n      .outer & {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    But instead it's actually equivalent to a `.outer :is(.inner button) { ... }` rule which unintuitively also matches the following DOM structure:\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n      <div class=\"outer\">\n        <button></button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    The `:is()` behavior is preferred by browser implementers because it's more memory-efficient, but the straightforward translation into a `.outer .inner button { ... }` rule is preferred by developers used to the existing CSS preprocessing ecosystem (e.g. SASS). It seems premature to commit esbuild to specific semantics for this syntax at this time given the ongoing debate.\n\n-   Fix cross-file CSS rule deduplication involving `url()` tokens ([#&#8203;2936](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2936))\n\n    Previously cross-file CSS rule deduplication didn't handle `url()` tokens correctly. These tokens contain references to import paths which may be internal (i.e. in the bundle) or external (i.e. not in the bundle). When comparing two `url()` tokens for equality, the underlying import paths should be compared instead of their references. This release of esbuild fixes `url()` token comparisons. One side effect is that `@font-face` rules should now be deduplicated correctly across files:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;import \"data:text/css, \\\n      @&#8203;import 'http://example.com/style.css'; \\\n      @&#8203;font-face { src: url(http://example.com/font.ttf) }\";\n    @&#8203;import \"data:text/css, \\\n      @&#8203;font-face { src: url(http://example.com/font.ttf) }\";\n\n    /* Old output (with --bundle --minify) */\n    @&#8203;import\"http://example.com/style.css\";@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}\n\n    /* New output (with --bundle --minify) */\n    @&#8203;import\"http://example.com/style.css\";@&#8203;font-face{src:url(http://example.com/font.ttf)}\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.17.9`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0179)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.17.8...v0.17.9)\n\n-   Parse rest bindings in TypeScript types ([#&#8203;2937](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2937))\n\n    Previously esbuild was unable to parse the following valid TypeScript code:\n\n    ```ts\n    let tuple: (...[e1, e2, ...es]: any) => any\n    ```\n\n    This release includes support for parsing code like this.\n\n-   Fix TypeScript code translation for certain computed `declare` class fields ([#&#8203;2914](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2914))\n\n    In TypeScript, the key of a computed `declare` class field should only be preserved if there are no decorators for that field. Previously esbuild always preserved the key, but esbuild will now remove the key to match the output of the TypeScript compiler:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    declare function dec(a: any, b: any): any\n    declare const removeMe: unique symbol\n    declare const keepMe: unique symbol\n    class X {\n        declare [removeMe]: any\n        @&#8203;dec declare [keepMe]: any\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    var _a;\n    class X {\n    }\n    removeMe, _a = keepMe;\n    __decorateClass([\n      dec\n    ], X.prototype, _a, 2);\n\n    // New output\n    var _a;\n    class X {\n    }\n    _a = keepMe;\n    __decorateClass([\n      dec\n    ], X.prototype, _a, 2);\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a crash with path resolution error generation ([#&#8203;2913](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2913))\n\n    In certain situations, a module containing an invalid import path could previously cause esbuild to crash when it attempts to generate a more helpful error message.

I've created a project on GitHub to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/fearghalom/angular15_material_issue.git\r\n2. I've defined a custom theme\r\n3. I've created a simple app with two buttons. One is a mat-raised-button (legacy) and the other is a simple HTML button. \r\n4.  Clicking on a button should show the spinner animation but it only works on the simple HTML button. \r\n5. If i change from the legacy Material imports to the latest, the spinner on the mat button works ok. \r\n6. I did some investigation and found that commenting out a line in _node_modules/@angular/material/core/focus-indicators/_private.scss_ , resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use 'sass:meta';\r\n@use '@angular/cdk';\r\n@use '../style/layout-common';\r\n@use '../theming/theming';\r\n\r\n// Private sass variables that will be used as reference throughout component stylesheets.\r\n$default-border-width: 3px;\r\n$default-border-style: solid;\r\n$default-border-color: transparent;\r\n$default-border-radius: 4px;\r\n\r\n// Mixin that renders the focus indicator structural styles.\r\n@mixin structural-styling($prefix) {\r\n  .#{$prefix}-focus-indicator {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n\r\n    &::before {\r\n      @include layout-common.fill();\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n      pointer-events: none;\r\n      //display: var(--#{$prefix}-focus-indicator-display, none);  !!!!

Create new project: `ng new test-prerender-svg-icon`\r\n2. Add Angular Material: `ng add @angular/material`\r\n3. Add Angular Universal: `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine`\r\n4. Download any svg icon like https://angular.io/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.svg into `src/assets/`\r\n5. **app.component.html**: Replace all default content with:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <mat-icon svgIcon=\"angular\" />\r\n   ```\r\n6. **app.module.ts**:\r\n    ```typescript\r\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\n    import { MatIconModule, MatIconRegistry } from '@angular/material/icon';\r\n    import { BrowserModule, DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\n    import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\n\r\n    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\n\r\n    @NgModule({\r\n      declarations: [\r\n        AppComponent\r\n      ],\r\n      imports: [\r\n        BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'serverApp' }),\r\n        BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n        HttpClientModule,  // Required for using iconRegistry.\r\n        MatIconModule,\r\n      ],\r\n      providers: [],\r\n      bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n    })\r\n    export class AppModule {\r\n      constructor(iconRegistry: MatIconRegistry, sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {\r\n        // See: https://material.angular.io/components/icon/overview#svg-icons.\r\n        iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('angular', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('/assets/angular.svg'));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n7. `ng serve` works fine and shows the svg icon.\r\n8. `npm run prerender` => `ERROR Error: Error retrieving icon :angular!`\r\n9. Same error with `npm run dev:ssr`.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpected `<mat-icon svgIcon=\"angular\" />` to work with Angular Universal prerendering (just like it works fine with `ng serve`).\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`npm run prerender` throws Error retrieving icon:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n⠹ Prerendering 1 route(s) to ~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/browser...ERROR Error: Error retrieving icon :angular!\r\n    at Object.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:3655776)\r\n    at ConsumerObserver2.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1216955)     \r\n    at SafeSubscriber2.Subscriber2._error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1216140)\r\n    at SafeSubscriber2.Subscriber2.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1215674)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2._error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1216140)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1215674)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2._error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1216140)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1215674)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2._error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1:1216140)\r\n    at OperatorSubscriber2.Subscriber2.error (~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/server/main.js:1✔ \r\nPrerendering routes to ~/test-prerender-svg-icon/dist/test-prerender-svg-icon/browser complete.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- @angular/cli: `15.1.6`\r\n- @angular/core: `15.1.6`\r\n- @angular/material: `15.1.5`\r\n- @nguniversal/express-engine `15.1.0`\r\n\r\ncc: @alan-agius4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26655","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-icon): SVG icons don't work with Angular Universal prerendering - npm run prerender: Error retrieving icon\" (#26655)"},{"Id":"1591533206","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-20T10:07:15","Actor":"AlixRoyere","Number":"26654","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-form-field): no required star displayed after label when using mat-date-range-input","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen an input is required, a star is put after the label to help the user.

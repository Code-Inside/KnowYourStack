Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nThe aio bazel build has race conditions on windows when many targets are built in parallel. This is a known issue, and was fixed in the angular project by disabling the rules_nodejs linker. In this PR I'm doing the same thing for aio, however there are some additional considerations.\r\n\r\n`rules_nodejs` patches `require` for cjs modules when the linker is disabled in order to resolve node modules. However, it has no such patches for esm modules. This causes our esm scripts (e.g., stackblitz, example zipper) to not be able to resolve their dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1. Add a custom esm loader (as I did in this PR).\r\n2. Convert those `.mjs` scripts to `.cjs`.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe race conditions disappear.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46533","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(bazel): fix race conditions in windows aio build\" (#46533)"},{"Id":"1286574664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-27T23:50:32","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46532","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): replace hand-written instructions in component tests with TestBed","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates a set of misc tests to avoid using hand-written instructions and replace them with TestBed APIs.\r\nThe changes also include removing some no longer needed internal test functions, which were previously deprecated.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n- [x] Other...

This makes it difficult for users who prefer to use a screen reader to identify icons on a page.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n0. On a Chromebook, open Chrome and enable ChromeVox\r\n1. Navigate to the demos at https://material.angular.io/components/icon/examples\r\n2. Use tab and search+arrow keys to navigate to the Basic Icon and the SVG Icon on the page\r\n3. Observe that CVox reads \"home\" for the basic icon rather than its aria-label, and ignores the SVG icon completely\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe aria-label on each icon should be included in the document flow. Instead of \"home\", I expect ChromeVox to read out the full aria label of the icon (which is \"Example home icon\"). It should also do the same for the SVG icon on the same page (which is \"Example thumbs up SVG icon\").\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIcon labels are left out of the document flow, and it's left to the user to use Search+G to get any information about them. However, the \"home\" text from the basic icon is read out in the basic document flow (this is not its aria label). \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome v102.0.5005.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ChromeOS v102.0.5005.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatIcon): Aria label on material icons is ignored by ChromeVox screen reader\" (#25147)"},{"Id":"1282314994","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-23T14:07:26","Actor":"iKrishnaSahu","Number":"25142","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(stackblitz): Stackblitz is down","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nStackblitz is down.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34937515/175296948-dd31cac9-0564-41f5-9608-5fad470eb660.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

In Ivy, the `TestBed.inject(MyService);` call succeeds and returns an instance of `FakeService`. In VE, this call fails as there is no `MyService` token registered in the NgModule injector.\r\n\r\nThe VE behavior seems logical to me, as the service wasn't originally provided in the NgModule injector and only registering an override should not register it at the NgModule level.\r\n\r\nIn Ivy, all provider overrides are registered in the NgModule injector:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/44bb85ade456a8223851b3b376fe7f5c8fe0864a/packages/core/testing/src/r3_test_bed_compiler.ts#L660-L665\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nSee testcase above.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nLatest master, 11.0.0-next.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39080","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TestBed overridden providers always registered in NgModule injector\" (#39080)"},{"Id":"712947600","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-01T15:24:12","Actor":"nhaancs","Number":"39079","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add install Firebase CLI step before using its commands","State":"open","Body":"You need to install Firebase CLI before using `firebase login` and `firebase init` commands.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Which is a step back from #17834.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand you try to please everyone and that *some* of the feedback you have may be negative, as an Angular trainer who teach to thousands of developers, I have a very different feedback. So the first thing I ask for is **transparency**, ie. knowing where your feedback comes from and why (with rational arguments, not just vague feelings like \"it is difficult\").\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm asking for **consistency**. The strict mode has a long and chaotic history in Angular. I won't redo the whole history here, but one example: you asked me in #17834 to add the `typedef` lint rule in *non-strict* projects, which can be quite annoying and is questionable when wanting to work in *loose* mode. So it was making *non*-strict projects *more* strict, while now you are making *strict* projects *less* strict with #18931.\r\n\r\nSo for both these reasons, I'm asking you to do **a public RFC for the strict mode**.\r\n\r\nBelow I will detail all my rationale.\r\n\r\n# Strict mode is opt-in and currently hidden\r\n\r\nFrom #18931:\r\n\r\n> users found it hard to work with the no-any lint rule\r\n\r\nEven putting aside that this rationale is questionable (more on that below), the strict mode is currently:\r\n- an *opt-in* option, meaning nobody is forced to use it,\r\n- a *hidden* option, meaning that someone using it is *choosing voluntarily* to do so.\r\n\r\nSo why people wanting to work in *loose* mode are using the strict mode at all? And as a consequence, why people wanting to do a good job, ie. in strict mode, should be impacted by the first people?\r\n\r\n# Why *static* typing is important\r\n\r\nBefore, what we did in JavaScript (with tools like jQuery) was very different: we we were just adding a few animations/interactions on a *website*. So if JavaScript was failing, the website would just not be animated, but would basically work.\r\n\r\nNow with tools like Angular, we are doing whole *applications*. As a consequence, JavaScript is now managing *routing* and *templating*, ie. in non-technical terms, navigation from page to page and displaying the pages. So **if JavaScript fails, the app is down**.\r\n\r\nSo **managing errors in Angular projects is not just a fantasy but a *requirement*.** While not all, a lot of errors comes from the fact that JavaScript has a dynamic typing system. Thus TypeScript.\r\n\r\n# Why *strict* typing is important\r\n\r\nIssue is: to be compliant with standard JavaScript, TypeScript does not enforce strict mode by default. That means that a lot of code is still subject to errors. Thus TypeScript `strict` mode.\r\n\r\nNote that a project created with `tsc --init` will be in `strict` mode by default, as it is the officially recommended way to work in TypeScript. React and Vue projects, when generated with TypeScript option, are also in `strict` mode by default.\r\n\r\n# Why *really* strict typing is important (`no-any`)\r\n\r\nIssue is: TypeScript `strict` mode is not that strict. It still allows explicit `any`. Each time you introduce an `any`, you open the door to errors.\r\n\r\nSo **if you really want to manage errors (which, as a reminder from above, is a *requirement*, not a fantasy), you have to prohibit `any` completely**:\r\n- when the type is really not known (which is very uncommon), the right type is `unknown`,\r\n- when the type is variable, the right solution is a generic.\r\n\r\nNote: what are the tools used for doing applications (ie. softwares) until now? Java, C#, C and so on. All have a *totally strict* typing system.\r\n\r\nThat is why my feedback is very different: even if the people I teach to are beginning with Angular, they are very often Java or C# developers, which are very aware of the necessity of all this.\r\n\r\n# Feedback on real projects\r\n\r\nI am also a consultant. So I've seen and audited several real Angular projects. Not having started a project in full strict mode is one of the most common issue I see, and one that is **very difficult to recover from**. Even on medium projects, there are very quickly hundreds and even thousands of non typed code (ie. breaches for errors).\r\n\r\nWhile people who do not understand the issues involved and explained above may find \"hard to work\" in full strict mode, it is even harder to work in a loose mode project: as time goes by, the code is less and less reliable, meaning more and more bugs, more and more maintenance, etc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18948","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"RFC for strict mode or let the opt-in strict mode really strict\"

([239968d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/239968d))\n-   **router:** Add `relativeLinkResolution` migration to update default value ([#&#8203;38698](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38698)) ([15ea811](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/15ea811))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **packaging:** In v10, IE 9, 10, and IE mobile support was deprecated. In v11, Angular framework removes IE 9,\n    10, and IE mobile support completely.\n    Supporting outdated browsers like these increases bundle size, code complexity, and test load,\n    and also requires time and effort that could be spent on improvements to the framework.\n    For example, fixing issues can be more difficult, as a straightforward fix for modern browsers\n    could break old ones that have quirks due to not receiving updates from vendors.\n-   **platform-webworker:** [@&#8203;angular/platform-webworker](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-webworker) and [@&#8203;angular/platform-webworker-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-webworker-dynamic)\n    have been removed as they were deprecated in v8\n-   **common:** The `slice` pipe now returns `null` for the `undefined` input value,\n    which is consistent with the behavior of most pipes. If you rely on\n    `undefined` being the result in that case, you now need to check for it\n    explicitly.\n-   **common:** The typing of the `keyvalue` pipe has been fixed to report that for\n    input objects that have `number` keys, the result will contain the\n    string representation of the keys. This was already the case and the\n    code has simply been updated to reflect this. Please update the\n    consumers of the pipe output if they were relying on the incorrect\n    types. Note that this does not affect use cases where the input values\n    are `Map`s, so if you need to preserve `number`s, this is an effective\n    way.\n-   **common:** The signatures of the number pipes now explicitly state which types are\n    accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n    values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-   **common:** The signature of the `date` pipe now explicitly states which types are\n    accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n    values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-   **common:** The async pipe no longer claims to return `undefined` for an input that\n    was typed as `undefined`. Note that the code actually returned `null` on\n    `undefined` inputs. In the unlikely case you were relying on this,\n    please fix the typing of the consumers of the pipe output.\n-   **common:** The case conversion pipes no longer let falsy values through. They now\n    map both `null` and `undefined` to `null` and raise an exception on\n    invalid input (`0`, `false`, `NaN`) just like most \"common pipes\". If\n    your code required falsy values to pass through, you need to handle them\n    explicitly.\n-   **router:** While the new parameter types allow a variable of type\n    `NavigationExtras` to be passed in, they will not allow object literals,\n    as they may only specify known properties. They will also not accept\n    types that do not have properties in common with the ones in the `Pick`.\n    To fix this error, only specify properties from the `NavigationExtras` which are\n    actually used in the respective function calls or use a type assertion\n    on the object or variable: `as NavigationExtras`.\n-   **router:** This commit changes the default value of\n    `relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'default'`. If your\n    application previously used the default by not specifying a value in the\n    `ExtraOptions` and uses relative links when navigating from children of\n    empty path routes, you will need to update your `RouterModule` to\n    specifically specify `'legacy'` for `relativeLinkResolution`.\n    See <https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions#relativeLinkResolution>\n    for more details.\n\n#### 10.1.4 (2020-09-30)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** enable [@&#8203;types](https://togithub.com/types) discovery in incremental rebuilds ([#&#8203;39011](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39011)) ([6e99427](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6e99427)), closes [#&#8203;38979](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38979)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Since `requestAnimationFrame` is called for each component, this results in <var>n</var> ticks, and for each tick, change detection is triggered in <var>n</var> web components (n^2).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution:\r\nA possible solution is to make one common `requestAnimationFrame` for all web components. I wrote a [custom strategy](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nn5ec8?file=src/element-strategy/component-factory-custom-strategy.ts) using this approach and the performance increased significantly (although it is still worse than in regular angular components):\r\n\r\n![web-vs-customweb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37049940/231425960-1188139e-c618-45f9-85b6-af140c5d4bf4.png)\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nn5ec8?file=src/element-strategy/component-factory-custom-strategy.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.5\r\nNode: 16.19.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router \r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33060","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49805","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"elements: initialization time of the components increases parabolically as the number of components grows\" (#49805)"},{"Id":"1664086142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-12T08:21:43","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"49804","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): onDestroy should be registered only on valid DestroyRef","State":"open","Body":"It might happen that the lifecycle scope represented by DestroyRef becomes invalid before an onDestroy hook is registered (ex. injector or component instance got destroyed).

this error is occuring thanks to npm or the actual angular aplication, but I've tried to uninstall and install again both the npm and angular 2 times now, but still nothing changes.\r\nI've also tryied to use it with out the installing being complete to check if it was just some weird bug, also did'nt work, also not an internet connection problem.\r\nI don't really know what to do since I'm new to all of this and would really apreciatte some help so I can end this course on

Lately, we noticed that in real applications it is easily reproducible when you start resource-consuming tasks on your PC.\r\n\r\nStackBlitz example is lightweight, so I had to use CpuKiller 3 application to slow down my CPU enough to reproduce it. I'm able to reproduce it fairly stable when slowdown CPU to 80+%. When I set 98%, I'm able to reproduce it every time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation with logpoints I was able to find that in `cdk/dialog/dialog-ref` it is somehow possible, that `closedSubject.complete()` will not be called immediately after `closedSubject.next(result)`, so 2 different flows are able to execute `next` before subject is completed.\r\nSee code that I'm referring above: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L100\r\n\r\nI get 2 fires from `material/dialog/dialog-ref`:\r\n1. `_ref.overlayRef.detachments().subscribe` - https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L93\r\n2. ` _containerInstance._animationStateChanged` - https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L87\r\n\r\nAlso, I was not able to understand why it is not reproducible on v15.\r\n\r\nCurrent workarounds:\r\n- add `pipe(take(1))` to `afterClosed` subscription - unfortunately, it requires a lot of changes over the app\r\n- remove `detectChanges` from .subscribe, or replace with `markForCheck` - it also requires a lot of changes in the app that may break something.\r\n- Upgrade to v15 :) - it requires upgrading everything\r\n\r\nAny ideas of possible workarounds?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open stackblitz URL https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rro47p\r\n2. Slow down your CPU\r\n3. Click on \"Open dialog\" and then click on \"close\" or outside of the modal\r\n4.

After upgrading Material to v15, we noticed that the whitespaces which are rendered around the content of an element annotated with mat-dialog-title are also visible on the UI. This was not the case in Material v14. In both versions when inspecting the DOM, you can see that whitespaces are visible around the text. The following example illustrates the problem:\r\n\r\nThis ...\r\n```\r\n<h2 mat-dialog-title>\r\n  Text content\r\n</h2>\r\n```\r\n\r\n... will be rendered as \" Text content \" in the DOM.\r\n\r\nIn Material v14 these whitespaces were simply ignored in by the MatDialogTitle, but since v15 they are actually visible on the UI as described above.\r\n\r\nMaterial v14:\r\n<img width=\"318\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50339686/230615884-d14ea354-3a5c-4b30-a024-d1ec26c4de97.png\">\r\n\r\nMaterial v15:\r\n<img width=\"212\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50339686/230616041-836a79fa-8a62-49dd-b4f7-2585662334e9.png\">\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

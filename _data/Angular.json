Two forms of `null` with different types and different behavior (`null` and `undefined`).\r\n- What's bad for optimization? Type coercion.\r\n\r\n`null`/`nil`/`nullptr`/etc. have already caused plenty of harm across many programming languages. The fact that JavaScript has both `null` and `undefined` just makes things much much worse for developers.\r\n\r\nI understand both Angular devs and many Angular users are coming from Java and lots of people want an extremely semantic type system which distinguishes between cases like \"it was never given a value\" (`undefined`) and \"it was **explicitly** given no value\" (`null`). I have written many, many thousands of lines of TypeScript code over my 4 years as an Angular developer and I must say that the distinction between the two is _rarely_ important. A hallmark of good code is simplicity (good for the reader and good for the computer), and one way to obtain simple code is to write it for the common case and only get verbose for the rare cases. The **only**—and I mean **only**—time I have ever needed to use `null` in JavaScript/TypeScript was with a CRUD API where the PATCH body could contain a `null` expiration to clear the expiration date for an item (JSON does not have `undefined` and so `undefined` values get omitted by default when encoding). Additionally, if I were the API designer, I would have simply offered a query parameter in the URL to clear the expiration.\r\n\r\nMy point is that 99% of the time, `null` and `undefined` are used interchangeably and the end user sees the same thing regardless of which one made its way through the code. You can be type-religious all you want but I think most of us can agree that making rare distinctions with more verbose code beats using 'nullish' coercions all over the place (and crashing when you forget to).\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the question: which is the winner, `null` or `undefined`? There is an [excellent article comparing them which you should definitely go read](https://medium.com/@oleg008/what-if-we-stop-using-null-d705302b545e), but, in short, `undefined` is better supported by the language.\r\n\r\n- `undefined` is the initial value for unassigned variables, just as `null` is in Java.\r\n- The above also applies to object properties, and even if you need to distinguish between implicit/explicit absence of a value, you can use the [`in` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) or the [`hasOwnProperty` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty) (doesn't check inherited properties).\r\n- `null` does not work with [parameter defaults](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) or [destructuring defaults](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Default_values_2).\r\n- Saner `typeof` check: `typeof undefined` yields `\"undefined\"` whereas `typeof null` yields `\"object\"` but it still does not behave as a regular object at all.\r\n\r\nI only use `undefined` in my code and it works out very well since, as I explained, it has lots of language support. I almost never need `null` checks (only for old APIs like local storage), but opting to use `null` religiously does not get anyone out of `undefined` checks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems like the Angular team disagrees, and now I have to write lots of special checks for `FormControl` values (Angular reactive forms), as well as for optional injection (the `NullInjector`).\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nclass MyModalComponent {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA)\r\n        @Optional()\r\n        private readonly data: {\r\n            readonly project?: ProjectInfo;\r\n            readonly parentID?: string;\r\n        } | null\r\n    ) {\r\n        // Could've just been a parameter default :/\r\n        if (data === null) {\r\n            this.data = data = {};\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the application I work on has a lot of data types, it also has a **lot** of forms. I have been porting the application from AngularJS to Angular for months now, and both Angular material and reactive forms have been a big letdown. I do not mean to be rude—lots of the new Angular features are fantastic and the performance difference with AOT compilation is _massive_—but writing forms has proven incredibly tedious and frustrating, mostly due to bad APIs (like the [new version of `ng-messages`](https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages)). Having to coerce `null` to `undefined` everywhere when making API requests is just the cherry on top. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWell, breaking existing project compatibility is bad. Then again, backwards-compatibility as the number one priority is also responsible for all of JavaScript and C++'s historical baggage. Rust bit the bullet and dropped green threads and garbage collection halfway through and became truly innovative as a result (a modern replacement for C/C++).\r\n\r\nThat said, changing the behavior of optional injection is probably **not** the move. 😅 Maybe provide an `@Opt()` decorator which yields `undefined` if the injection token is not found and deprecate `@Optional()`?\r\n\r\nForms have proven much more of a nuisance than the optional injection `null` checks, and reactive forms' usage of `null` is just the tip of the iceberg there.\r\n\r\nI suppose I'm mostly just trying to start a conversation with the hopes that a future forms API benefits from it. I will also do my part and open source any reactive forms replacement I end up writing (which I certainly will!).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWriting lots of 'nullish' coercion code.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39557","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Erase null off the face of the Earth\" (#39557)"},{"Id":"735910996","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-04T15:41:34","Actor":"div-wynk","Number":"39558","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to detect 304 status code of response using http client","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUnable to detect if the response status code is 304 after subscribing\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private http: HttpClient\r\n){}\r\n\r\ngetFullRes(headers,url){\r\nconst httOptions = {\r\n      headers: new HttpHeaders(headers),\r\n      observe: 'response' as 'body'\r\n    };\r\n    return this.http.get(url, httOptions);\r\n}\r\ngetFullRes(headers,url).subscribe(res=>{\r\n// here i want to detect status code as 304 but whenever res.status is 200 only then the below console.log works\r\nconsole.log(res);\r\n})\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39558","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to detect 304 status code of response using http client\" (#39558)"},{"Id":"736081102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-04T15:41:01","Actor":"munchkindev","Number":"39564","RawContent":null,"Title":"Button inside mat-tab is bugged","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/material\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNo clue, did not try this before.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> So I basically have a button which adds in another tab.

This is probably not a problem, but may cause the compilation of entry points to be out of order\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally we use TS Paths in order for ngcc to recognize the folder in the first place:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"generated/*\": [\r\n        \"generated/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst workaround is to silence the warning with the snippet bellow, but we would have to repeat the entry for each and every library we produce.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ngcc.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  packages: {\r\n    'library/name': {\r\n      ignorableDeepImportMatchers: [\r\n        /generated\\//,\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond workaround would be to release `ngcc.config.js` with each library, looking like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  ignorableDeepImportMatchers: [/generated\\//]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nand add `ngcc.config.js` to assets of `ng-package.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"../../node_modules/ng-packagr/ng-package.schema.json\",\r\n  \"dest\": \"../../dist/library/name\",\r\n  \"assets\": [\"./ngcc.config.js\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThird workaround is to use `impor type` syntax for all generated types:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { MyType } from 'generated';\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis would take a massive effort to reproduce.

No matter if it’s the beginning of a sentence or not.\r\n \r\nGenerate translation files and translate them. You will get three nodes.

Internally the CLI uses the function for example [for calling the PWA schematic](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b2174947924a781f7db41377be989750e042a968/packages/angular/pwa/pwa/index.ts#L159). This won't be problematic as is already installed as part of the `@angular/schematics` package and in fact it's part of the `node_modules`.\r\n\r\nOnce you'll try to install an external schematic which isn't already available in the `node_modules` the schematic fails.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to manually integrate an installation procedure first and then call the function like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const installNpmPackage = (\r\n  context: SchematicContext,\r\n  packageName: string,\r\n): Promise<void> => {\r\n  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {\r\n    context.logger.info(\r\n      `📦 Installing package '${packageName}' for external schematic setup...`,\r\n    );\r\n    const spawnOptions: SpawnOptions = { stdio: 'inherit' };\r\n    spawn('npm', ['install', packageName], spawnOptions).on(\r\n      'close',\r\n      (code: number) => {\r\n        if (code === 0) {\r\n          context.logger.info(\r\n            `✅ '${packageName}' package installed successfully`,\r\n          );\r\n          resolve();\r\n        } else {\r\n          const errorMessage = `❌ installation of '${packageName}' package failed`;\r\n          context.logger.error(errorMessage);\r\n          throw new Error();\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n    );\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst packageName = '@briebug/cypress-schematic';\r\nawait installNpmPackage(context, packageName);\r\nreturn externalSchematic(packageName, 'ng-add', {\r\n  removeProtractor: true,\r\n  addCypressTestScripts: true,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be great to integrate the installation process for a package that's not present in the `node_modules` in the `externalSchematic` function.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`externalSchematics` should install packages locally when they are no

Open/Close the menu\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI am expecting \"up\" and \"down\" to show up alternatively, depending on if the menu is closed or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe behavior is inconsistent, i.e. showing \"up\" and \"down\" in different states.\r\n\r\n#### Possible Fix\r\n\r\nFollow a more reactive approach and expose the menuState as a stream.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: ~10.2.0\r\n- CDK/Material: ^10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s):  Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(menu): matMenuTrigger not exposing menuOpen properly\" (#20959)"},{"Id":"735097448","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-03T07:47:44","Actor":"leogout","Number":"20958","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(MatCardModule): useless mat-card tag in the doc examples","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nHere :\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/card/examples \r\nOn the second example, there is a `<mat-card></mat-card>` above the Shiba Inu example :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9843962/97960113-109be080-1db1-11eb-84db-ddb1d3ee89d4.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-card> <- here\r\n</mat-card> <- and here\r\n<mat-card>\r\n  <mat-card-header>\r\n    <div mat-card-avatar></div>\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nI suggest to remove those unused tags.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(MatCardModule): useless mat-card tag in the doc examples\" (#20958)"},{"Id":"734865595","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-02T23:03:20","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"20955","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 10.2.7 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20955","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 10.2.7 w/ changelog\" (#20955)"},{"Id":"734647551","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-02T22:03:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"20952","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 11.0.0-rc.1 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20952","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 11.0.0-rc.1 w/ changelog\" (#20952)"},{"Id":"734827127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-02T21:19:00","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"20954","RawContent":null,"Title":"MatCheckbox should be `display: inline-block`","State":"open","Body":"Currently `<mat-checkbox>` is `display: inline`.
